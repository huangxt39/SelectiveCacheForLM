critical response:
... razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look' 
Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, Toy Story is one of the best voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... making their presences strongly felt.
It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatest children's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids.
 'a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period.

introduction:
Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The directorial debut of John Lasseter, Toy Story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced by Pixar. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a new home. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.

description:
In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift   an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actual space ranger. 
Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toys rebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips. 
The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy. On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile

user2: Have you seen the original Toy Story?
user1: I have seen all three Toy Story movies.
user1: Have you seen the original?
user2: Yes. I can't believe the first one came out in 1995!  
user1: It has been a while, but they are all decent.  Toy Story 3 is, in my opinion, the best.
user2: You should watch it again sometime. The Potato shaped doll is voiced by Don Rickles.
user1: I know.  He has recently passed.  He was Mr. Potato Head.
user1: Do you have a favorite character. 
user2: Tom Hanks as Woody actually makes to the doll, Woody believable as a character.
user1: I think Tom Hanks was wonderful.  Although I think Tim Allen deserves a lot of credit as well.
user1: Where do you rank the movie among Pixar movies?
user2: Did you know that Joss Whedon and Joel Cohen wrote some of the screenplay?
user1: I did not know that.  Joss Whedon is good.  I don't know Joel Cohen.  I was a big Buffy fan.
user2: According to critics it is one of the best animated movies in recent memory with all these actors.
user1: Yes, but what do you think about it?  Is it one of your favorites?
user2: On rotten tomatoes it has a 100% fresh rating and Cinema Score gave it an A. I would say that means it's pretty good.
user1: I understand, but did you watch it and form your own opinion.  I mean 100% just means a lot of critics liked it more than disliked it.  It doesn't mean critics thought it was one of the best of all time, you know.
user1: Need a human for that.
user2: One of the best scenes is when Buzz is first introduced to the characters. It's pretty funny that he thinks he's an actual space ranger.
user1: I enjoy that scene as well.  
user1: Do you think it's the best Pixar movie of all time?
user2: It must be the highest rated.
user1: I wouldn't be surprised if Toy Story 3 is ranked higher, but I haven't checked.
user1: Which is your favorite character in the movie?
user2: Slinky dog or Rex
user2: There is a morality tale including in a seemingly simple story when it comes to the relationship between Buzz and Woody. Woody feels replaced and when he knocks Buzz out the window everyone thinks he is jealous for that reason.
user1: Disney world is going to make a roller coaster out of Slinky Dog.  Do you think that will be great?
user1: I don't know if I'd call that a morality story, but go on.
user2: Interesting. They should make one for Sid's dog, Scud too.
user1: That might work.  We're looking forward to Toy Story World.
user1: Anything else strike you as important about the movie?
user2: I have not heard of TOy story world.
user2: The end is funny when Andy's newest gift worries the toys.
user1: It's the world disney world is making in Hollywood Studios.  Disneyworld is divided into four parks, which are further divided into lands
user1: Toy Story Land is an upcoming world.  (Also star wars world).   Have a wonderful night.
user2: I see.
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi!
user2: Could you tell me a little bit about this movie and maybe who is in it?

conversation:
user1: Hello there
user2: Hello!
user1: So, what is this movie?
user2: The movie i was given a document for has wonderful ratings. It has a rotten tomatoes score of 100% and a cinema score of an !
user2: A
user2: The movie is animated based, but it has some great actors, Tom Hangs, and Tim Allen star in this film
user1: That's pretty impressive, what is the title?
user2: Toy Story
user1: Love Tom Hanks
user1: Oh I heard of this, what is it about exactly? Toys?
user2: Tom Hanks is a national treasure. and he really brings his A game in this movie. Its a story about anthropomorphic toys pretending to be lifeless whenever humans are present
user2: And for Andy's birthday the toys are scared that they are going to be replaced by other toys and they'll be forgotten
user1: That's pretty original for sure. I like the sound of that, is it emotional or funny?
user1: Who is Andy?
user2: Andy is the young boy who owns these toys. 
user1: Is Andy an only child?
user2: And the movie is very funny, even for audiences that may be older than the intended childrens demographic. and is suprisingly emotional as you see the struggles of being replaced going on with Woody 
user2: Andy has a younger sister named molly
user1: Interesting, is it a recent film?
user2: No, this film came out in 1995
user1: What is the animation like? Is it hand drawn like the old animated films?
user2: It is computer animated, but it is produced by disney.
user1: Ohhhhhhh Disney, I love what they do with animation. Computer animated, early days indeed, does it look good?
user2: Though it is older, the animation really does look great. What they chose to animate looks wonderful, and they didnt do anything that looks to bad compared to todays standards
user1: What are the characters like? Are they compelling? 
user2: Very much so. You have characters that are conveying an array of emotions and story arc's. For instance, we have buzz who is a galactic force ranger toy who doesnt believe that he is a toy. 
user2: Then Woody is getting jealous, trying to get rid of buzz in a myriad of ways; This all stems from the fact that everyone is so impressed with Buzz and comes to a boiling point when Andy chooses buzz over woody as a toy to take out to a pizza place
user1: That's funny, so Buzz & Woody are the main characters?  Why does Andy choose Buzz over Woody?
user2: Yes, they are the main characters. Andy chooses Buzz because he's the new popular toy with different actions and lights and sounds. 
user1: Are Buzz & Woody enemies because of that?
user2: Yes! That is one of the main causes of the conflict. Woody feels like he is being replaced with something new
user1: Was the film successful when it came out?
user2: It was a smash! Crictics were calling it brilliant. People applauded the technique of digital animation. The story was lauded as fun for children and adults alike
user1: I kinda want to watch it now.

user1: Do you like animated movies?
user2: Yes I do!
user1: Have you ever seen Toy Story?
user2: No I haven't. What is it about?
user1: It's about toys that come to life, it stars a pull string cowboy named Woody who is kind of the favorite toy of the main character named Andy.
user2: Oh that sounds interesting! I always wondered as a kid what it would be like to have your toys come to life lol
user1: But Woody's life gets interrupted when Andy gets a new toy at his birthday, named Buzz Lightyear. Buzz thinks hes an actual space ranger and not a toy!
user2: Oh goodness!
user1: Tim Allen plays Buzz Lightyear and Tom Hanks is Woody.
user2: Those are great choices for voices!
user1: There is also a character named Mr Potato Head, a slinky dog, and a nervous green Tyrannasaurus rex.
user2: How cool that they added Mr Potato Head lol 
user1: Buzz becomes one of Andy's favorite toys and Woody begins to feel left out, so Woody decides to trap him, that doesn't work and they both end up at a pizza place for a family outing.
user2: This sounds like an interesting adventure! I need to see this movie!
user1: At the pizza place Buzz still thinks that he is a space ranger, despite woody trying to convince him otherwise, and they end up stuck inside a crane game, where Andy's toy-killing neighbor Sid ends up winning them in the crane game.
user2: A toy-killing neighbor? That sounds scary for the toys!
user1: Sid takes the two toys home and they end up meeting a bunch of other toys that sid had torn apart, and they become really scared, but they end up escaping.
user2: I'm glad they escaped! Sounds like they could have ended up in a bad situation if they hadn't!
user1: After they escape, Andy's family ends up moving and the two toys almost miss the moving truck to get out, but they hope on a toy car to catch the truck.
user2: I bet Andy would have been heartbroken to have left them behind!
user1: I bet he would've. It then shows that they are at Christmas day, and they are all freaking out because they think that Andy might get a new toy to replace them. But Andy doesn't... he gets.. A PUPPY
user2: Aww that's awesome!

user1: Hi~
user2: Hello. So the movie I have is Toy Story. It came out in 1995 directed by John Lasseter. Have you seen it?
user1: I have seen it!
user1: A bunch of times, I have 3 small kids lol
user1: What do you think about the reviews?
user2: Haha me too. I have 2 small kids.  
user2: I agree with the reviews. They seem to portray the movie in a well respected manor. 
user1: They do
user1: 23 years later, I feel like it holds up
user2: Makes me feel old haha. 
user1: Same! I was in middle school when it came out
user2: Although I thought the 2nd one was good, I lost interest in the 3rd. Im all about the 1st one. 
user1: The last one made me cry!
user1: The first one is usually the best one
user1: What did you think of Tom Hanks in it?
user2: Well its Tom Hanks so can you ever really go wrong? I love that he makes Woody so unique and makes him stand out aside from the point that he is a main character. 
user2: Who is your favorite character in the movie?
user1: It is so hard to pick! 
user1: Probably Woody, but Buzz is great too
user1: The way they play off each other is great!
user2: I love Slinky Dog. 
user1: YESS!!
user1: And Rex! With his tiny arms!! LOL
user1: Do you like the way the story was resolved?
user2: My next key scene is where Andy goes to Pizza Planet and Buzz and Woody manage to hitch a ride on the pizza truck and have their encounter with Sid. 
user2: First off Sid and his creepy toys scared me as a child. Lol.
user1: They did!!
user1: Oh and the little aliens!!!
user1: OOOOHHHHHH
user2: YES!!!! THE CLAW! hahaha.
user1: I LOVE the claw!!
user1: Does the story keep your kids entertained?
user2: Yes. They get so invested in it as if they are apart of it. Its one of their favorites.
user1: Do they ever play pretend with their toys like Andy does?
user2: Yes. They get creative to put it. I side eye them sometime because apart of me is like "what if...." hahaha.
user2: Do your kids play like that as well? Or are mine just weird ones?
user1: Hahahahah that's great! Mine do, but they are more into cars/trains/legos than action figures
user1: Do you feel like this movie will stand the test of time with future generations?
user2: my 5 year old is into cars and stuff. My 3 year old is all about action figures and super heros
user2: I personally think that Toy Story is a classic that will never fade. I think that we are proof. We watched when we were young, now our kids are watching them. Very few movies have that impact on people.

user1: Hello.
user2: Hello

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hello!
user1: Did you read the document about the movie?
user2: I did.  The movie I suggest you watch is Toy Story.
user1: That sounds like an entertaining movie!
user1: Is that the older animated one?
user2: Toy Story is an animated movie, and believe it or not, it came out in 1995.
user1: Wow, that sounds really old. What kind of genre is it?
user2: It is listed as a comedy/adventure.
user2: It has scored well with audiences with a 100% score on rotten tomatoes
user1: 0% sounds bad\
user1: oh, nevermind. 100%
user1: Is it marketed towards children?
user2: It is marketed towards children, but some of the older toys are certainly nostalgic for adults
user1: Oh, I see. So it's more of a family movie?
user1: Is it rated pg?
user2: Certainly a family movie.  It doesn't says if its PG, but I would guess it is.
user1: Do you know anything about the plot?
user2: When humans aren't around, the toys come to life and have their own lives.
user2: Some of the voice actors include Tom Hanks and Tim Allen
user1: Do the toys have a common goal? Is there a villian or are they just playing around?
user2: The villain is the neighbor who likes to destroy toys and experiment with them.  When Tom Hanks character, Woody, gets stuck over there the other toys have to rescue him.
user1: Do the toys ever get caught by humans?
user2: Without spoiling it too much, they only get caught once and that's because it was part of their plan.
user1: That sounds amusing. 
user1: Does anything bad happen to them if they do get caught? Like, are there any negative effects? Or do they just avoid getting caught for fun?
user2: Thats a good question.  It is unlikely anything happens to them if they get caught.  I think they avoid human contact to keep together.
user1: Do all of the toys in the movie's universe come alive or is it only special ones?
user2: They all come alive.  Mr. Potato head, rolling kids phone...you name it, it can communicate.
user2: Tom Hanks plays a cowboy toy named Woody, the main character.
user1: Who are the actors for the other toys?
user2: Tim Allen, Don Rickles, and Jim Varney to name a few.

user2: definitly
user1: it got a 100 on rotten tomatoes that seems great
user1: looking at the plot points made me remember some good sceens
user2: yes it did the critics also said tom hanks voice of woody is one of the best animated features in history
user1: yes
user2: like when buzz was trying to impress all the other toys with his cool new modern features
user1: yes that was great
user1: was it this one when they go in that room with that baby toy
user2: I cant remember I think so

user2: bless
user1: yes

conversation:
user2: Hi there, happy Wednesday!
user1: Hey! Same to you.
user1: Let me read my part.
user2: Okay :)
user1: Okay, the movie I've got is the original Toy Story from 1995.
user2: Oh nice that's an old one, classic though!
user1: It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100%, a MetaCritic score of 95, and a CinemaScore of A, all of which I totally agree with. :)
user2: Yea I would probably agree with that, its a family friendly movie for most ages. 
user1: It starred Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, and a host of other people as secondary characters.
user2: Does it say who plays Mr. Potato head? he is one of my favorites!
user1: Mr. Potato Head was voiced by Don Rickles, which I actually didn't know, even though I've seen all of them a handful of times.
user2: I don't know who that is either, maybe one of those people you would know if you saw them!
user1: The reviews from various sites all highly praise it, with one saying: "It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatest children's films."
user2: It's very whimsical to think your toys come to life, I'm sure a lot of kids dream that up 
user1: Do you typically like movies like this?
user2: I do like children movies, I kind of have to as I have two young kiddos, I like disney and Pixar 
user2: how about you?
user1: I do. I don't have any kids but I have really enjoyed all of Pixar's movies.
user2: They are just made so well, I guess they take quite some time to make them.
user1: I actually saw Toy Story right when it originally came out. I was pretty young then and I obsessed over it for quite some time.
user2: 1995, I would be ... 9 I think... I am sure I watched it when it came out and then of course the sequals
user1: I was 7 in 1993, so we were around the same age. I think nearly everyone in my public school liked the original movie.
user1: It was apparently the directorial debut of John Lasseter.
user2: I hear there is a Toy story 4 coming in 2019! lol like its never ending!
user1: Fine with me. :)
user2: right, got to see them all now 
user2: I'd say John Lasseter did well and was on to something and ran with it!
user1: I don't have any other info on John, so I don't know if he directed the sequels or not.
user2: Good talking to you! :) 
user1: Seems like the conversation is done on my end. Is it with yours too?
user2: yes! :)
user1: Same! Have a good day!

conversation:
user1: The movie is Toy Story.
user1: From 1995, director is John Lasseler, 100% rotten tomatoes, 9/10 score.
user2: Hello, have you seen Toy Story? I did. I Agree with the critical that is has the purity and ecstatic freedom of imagination. What do you think?
user1: I agree, it was a very popular movie.
user2: I love animations and Pixar is amazing. This one was really perfect. As it was mentioned a work of genius.
user1: I also love Pixar
user1: Maybe they'll make another Toy Story movie.
user2: The interaction between Woody and Buzz is really nice. Also hearing Tom Hanks as Wood is incredible.
user1: Oh yeah, classic voice
user1: I like how their friendship grew.
user2: It was really interesting to see they change from rivals to friends
user1: I like the supporting toys too.
user2: For sure Woody and Buzz are amazing but also the other are perfect.
user1: Isn't there a few Toy Story movies?
user2: Yes for sure. On the begging the scene of Andy's party is really breathtaking don't you think?
user1: Yeah, when he first got Buzz.
user1: You still there?
user2: For sure, and the other toys are very funny
user1: Who is your favorite?
user2: Ohh difficult to say. But I suppose Mr Potato Head.
user2: And what about your?
user1: Bopeep I think 
user2: And what about the scene on Pizza Planet. What a confusion, right?
user1: Yeah!
user1: but that's when the little aliens came in
user2: For sure, and also all the run to be able to get there. Really nice.
user2: And what about Andy's neighbor Sid. What a terrifying children for the toys, right?
user2: Andy's RC car is really funny don't you think?
user1: I don't remember either.
user2: Woody flying back to Andy's car is really a nice one.
user2: Have you enjoyed the end of the history?
user1: What do you mean?
user2: How the things come to the end, meaning a happy end right?
user1: Oh definitely!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: yo
user1: Have seen the movie Toy Story?
user2: ye
user1: I mean- have you
user1: Did you you like it?
user1: Tom Hanks did a great job. Right?
user2: he always does
user2: thats why that movie got 100 percent
user1: It's said to be one of the best voiced animated movie. 
user2: on rotten tomatoes
user2: Its a classic 
user2: pretty much made the path for all the other ones
user1: So to say.
user2: Just to think that movie came out in 1995
user1: Yes, Great comedy.
user2: I actually like tim allen in that movie
user1: Nice
user2: such an underated actor
user2: just wish he would try drama movies and not comedy
user1: Yes. It was directed by John Lasseter
user2: Never really heard of that director before
user2: Did he do the newer ones?
user1: The cast were great
user1:  I'm not sure
user1: The story was the first feature length computer animated film
user2: And the animation still looks decent even to this day
user1: It was said to be a work of genus 
user2: arguably some people think the newest one was the best
user1: Can't really say though
user2: haven
user2: seen it?
user1: Yeah
user2: oh go watch it
user2: its really good
user1: I've seen it. Liked it too
user2: oh gotcha
user2: have a good day
user1: You too

conversation:
user1: Hi how are you doing today?
user2: I'm doing great! How are you?
user1: I'm great, thanks!
user2: What is new?
user1: I just saw a great movie recently. Toy Story.
user1: It's a Pixar movie with great graphics
user1: It's a family movie with a great message
user2: Oh, that sounds awesome. Who is the best character, in your opinion?
user1: Definitely Woody who is voiced by Tom Hanks.
user2: Tom Hanks? You can't go wrong with him. He has so many great movies
user1: Even as a voice actor he is great
user1: It also has Tim Allen voicing the character of Buzz Lightyear
user2: Do you think there will be any sequels?
user1: He's great too
user1: There are already several sequels
user1: They're good too but the original is the best
user2: Is that so? Well, I will really have to check these out. I do love Disney and those actors
user1: In the movie it shows how toys have a life of their own when their children owners are away
user2: That is an interesting concept. So the kids don't find out?
user1: In it, Woody is afraid he is losing the relationship of his owner because he is growing up and his interests are changing
user2: Aw, that sounds so sad. Kind of odd though, if you think about it... Self aware toys with an attachment to their owner 
user1: The kids never know the toys come alive on their own
user1: It's an interesting concept
user1: Overall, it has a great message about friendship
user2: That is very sweet. Toys are probably better than humans about it, ha ha
user1: The toys have some great adventures
user2: So are there any cliff hangers?
user1: It's definitely a great movie that both kids and adults would enjoy
user1: no its all resolved
user2: I personally don't think you ever outgrow Disney movies
user2: Do the toys have elaborate back stories?
user1: no, not really
user2: No room for spin offs about individual toys, then?
user1: But it's a great movie
user2: It sounds like it. I will most definitely have to add it to my list
user1: I really suggest watching it
user2: Do you know when this movie was released?
user1: 1995
user2: That was quite some time ago, wow. There's nothing like the classics though

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you seen the movie, Toy Story, directed by John Lasseter?
user1: Yes I have, what was a notable part for you?
user2: I really enjoyed the recognizable voices of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. I pretty much enjoy anything they're in. How about you?
user1: The movie has been a childhood favorite of mine and I loved them putting a mind behind a toy and showing what a toy may be thinking in everyday scenarios.
user2: I remember watching it when it first came out I was still a young teen. The animation wasn't like the other animated movies I'd seen, and the storyline was relatable. Now I let my own children watch it. I really enjoy watching them enjoy it too.
user1: It was revolutionary for its time that is for sure and I am sure it will be enjoyed for generations especially with toy story land being built at Disney World
user2: Yeah, I often felt like my toys had conscious' when I was a kid, like they had feelings. I think the movie did a good job of portraying emotion of different variety among each toy's personality.
user1: Exactly and the whole idea behind how toys could be evil was an interesting thing to grasp as a kid
user2: The same way the boy had a relationship with Woody, only to be replaced by Buzz Lightyear, the new flashy toy. I see that all the time with my boys. But they always return to their old favorite.
user1: Yes you always have those faithful toys you return and Toy Story did a great job showing that and I loved the part where eventually they resolve their differences and become friend many people need to work on this in todays society even.
user2: Agreed, the toys competing for Andy's affection reminds me of a grade school click among the girls I new in private catholic school. The entire emotional personas of the characters was spot on.
user1: Oh yes they hit clicks spot on in the movie and showed that sometimes you gotta put aside your differences to overcome a challenge in this case returning to Andy.
user2: I enjoy the movie, Toy Story, even more now as an adult, than I did as a kid, especially getting to see my own children relate to the emotions of the movie. I feel like the writers and producers knew what they were doing, and did a great job of it to create longevity for this movie becoming a classic enjoyed by generations to come.
user2: Tell me what you thought of the score it received by Rotten tomatoes?
user1: Exactly and the directors did a great job of adding characters in such as mr potato head to add a huge comedic value to the movie which helps it appeal to more than just one audience. I agree completely with its review score the tactics it employed in the movie to snag the viewers attention was great and It really is a movie that can cross generations
user2: I thought it did really well 100% by Rotten Tomatoes and averaging 9/10, I'm not surprised.
user1: Yes and rightfully so I believed it was nominated for a couple Oscars on top of that
user2: The scene at the pizza party is so relatable, watching the terror of the toys realizing that the family had left without them. I remember forgetting toys and the emotions felt by that was so traumatizing as a kid. I felt the toy's emotions then. The movie did a beautiful job of giving me the feels.
user1: I know what you mean leaving toys behind as a kid broke your heart and they did a good job showing that toys felt the same way when their owners left without them. It was definitely a touching movie
user2: Also I enjoyed the neighbor kid, the bad kid, I remember that kid growing up. The toys rightfully afraid of him. That Sid was my Jeremy on the bus.
user2: I really enjoyed each and every character having their own unique personality. I think I found Rex the most enjoyable with his timid and nervous behavior. Who was your favorite character?
user1: My favorite character was slinky dog
user1: or piggy bank too
user1: what about you?
user2: They we're both cute characters's. Why were they your favorite?
user2: I liked timid Rex, I found his nervousness endearing.
user1: slinky dog just because i love dogs plus his stretching ability was really cool as a kid and piggy bank was just hilarious too me
user1: aww trex was great I loved how each character added their own uniqueness to the movie
user2: The movie, Toy Story is so good because It has all the adventure packed in from what I loved from watching movies as a kid in the 80's, except now the adventurers are the toys trying to be reunited with Andy, their buddy. 
user1: Thats a really good way to put it had action comedy and everything most people want in a movie but in a kid friendly environment
user2: I think I'm going to have to turn on Toy Story this evening when my kids are home from school and pop some popcorn for a family fun night at home. Toy Story will be the perfect addition!
user2: It was a pleasure discussing Toy Story with you today!
user2: Have a great day!

conversation:
user1: Hey. How's it going?
user2: Hi
user2: Am still reading the text document
user2: please hold on
user2: Have you seen the movie "Toy Story"
user1: Why yes I have. It's been a while. Which one? The first one?
user2: The one produced in 1995
user2: Starring Tom Hanks
user2: Do you like the movie as much as i do?
user1: I have not seen the first one but I have seen the last one ironically.
user2: Which one is that?
user1: Toy Story 4 I believe. When he leaves for college.
user1: How do you like the first Toy Story though?
user2: Extremely awesome
user2: Do u like cartoons in general?
user2: And what's your opinion about toys?
user1: I do. Reminds me of my childhood. If the topic is good, I'll watch cartoons any day.
user2: Do you think toys are more superficial than humans?
user1: Hm. What do you mean?
user2: I mean, do u think toys reason more than human being?
user2: And have more abilities than humans?
user2: meaning- toys can work endlessly without taking a break while humans can run for long without a break
user1: Interesting question. I guess in the sense of the movies like Toy Story, yes and no. They could be given the characteristics of doing tasks without getting tired but I think some of the characters in Toy Story did some outlandish things that lead me to believe that they would not reason more than humans.
user2: Oh yea
user2: They got confused most of the time
user1: Do you think they have more abilities than humans?
user2: Yes i do
user2: They can work for hours, years without resting, whereas humans cant
user1: That is true.
user2: yeah
user1: What do you think the reasoning is behind having the toys be still when humans are around? I mean how awesome would it be as a kid to have your toys interact back with you.
user2: Do u think human can possess such abilities someday?
user1: Humans....maybe. Robots yes.
user2: It'd be great to have that option
user2: i would have love to see that happen
user2: How would rate the movie?
user2: How would u rate the movie?
user1: I have not seen the first one. How about you? What would you rate it?
user2: 10/10
user1: Awesome.
user2: And u
user2: If i can have the kind of energy toys have, i would be immortal..
user2: Still with me?

conversation:
user2: Hi

user1: I love the actors
user1: or at least voices...haha
user2: I love the actors too
user2: haha
user2: I've never seen the movie tho
user1: me neither... just clips
user2: Yeah
user2: I'm going to have to watch it with my kids tho. 
user1: the ratings are awesome
user2: I know. Until an earlier discussion I never knew it had 2 sequals
user1: Buzz Lightyear apparently discovers that he is a toy... that could be a funny scene!
user1: especially voiced by Tim Allen...
user2: Definitely 
user1: espionage via baby monitors by the toys... that has got to interesting
user1: I didn't know that this was the director's first film... great job!
user2: Using the baby monitors lol
user2: I didn't either. He got it right the first time apparently
user1: yeah
user2: So the cowboy and Buzz are rivals for Andy's attention
user1: looks like it.
user1: They get to hitch a ride on a pizza truck.  This is all kinds of adventure for 12" action figures!
user2: Yes it is...haha
user2: I think I might like this movie as much as my kids would
user1: Steve Jobs was a part of the executive team as well
user1: Haha... I know

user1: Hello
user2: Let's talk about Toy Story
user2: 1995  Comedy,Animation,Adventure
user2: directed by John Lasseter
user1: It sounds interesting
user2: 1. Rotten Tomatoes: 100% and average: 9/102. Metacritic Score: 95/1003. CinemaScore: A
user2: ● Tom Hanks as Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll.
user1: People really like it!
user2: Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure and Woody's rival, who laterbecomes his best friend.
user1: How long is the movie?
user2: 1 hr 21 m
user1: Are there songs in it?
user2: Yes award winning songs by Randy Newman
user2: Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy adventure film produced byPixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The directorial debut of John Lasseter, ToyStory was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced byPixar. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless wheneverhumans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashionedpullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure(voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner,to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a newhome. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and AlecSokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film featuresmusic by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.
user1: Oh, interesting that Joss whedon was a writer on it
user2: Yeah he does a lot of punch-ups
user2: Here's a key scene
user2: In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present,a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy'sbirthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, arepreparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-stringcowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep theshepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog,into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report theresults to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to endwith none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – anelectronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actualspace ranger.
user1: Uh oh that actually sounds kinda sad
user1: But he must not really replace anyone since he becomes bff with Woody
user2: Yeah
user2: another scene
user2: Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him,making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his motherallows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzzbehind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toysrebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they canexact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the familystops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well, and fight, only tofind the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant bystowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger,despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game,where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.
user1: Sid Phillips must be good at crane games
user1: What happens after they get out of the crane game?
user1: Does Sid know they're Andy's toys?
user1: Did Sid go to Andy's party?
user1: I mean are they friends or enemies?
user2: Oh yes
user2: They all become friends
user1: How lovely!
user2: The toys reveal their real nature to Sid and scare him, scaring him for life
user1:  pretty funny
user2: shows him for playing with inanimate toys in a creative way
user2: more key scenes
user2: The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and giveschase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing himwith Andy's RC car, but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well, attack andtoss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continueafter the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize theirmistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted,stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into thetruck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocketbefore it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy.On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissancemission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worsethan Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile
user2: critical response
user2: ● "... razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look"● "Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, ToyStory is one of the best voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... makingtheir presences strongly felt."● "It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatestchildren's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times,will tickle adults even more than it does kids."● "a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to theirown character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, whenBuzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircaseand the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massiveego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period."
user2: and there's 2 sequels. Toy Story 3 is my favorite one
user1: That toy space man had real rockets?
user1: Also, scud is a great dog name
user2: naw they tie a firework to him

conversation:
user2: This was one of the best kids animated movies ever
user1: Agreed! I think the AAA actors for voice acting was a smart decision that helped put the movie as highly ranked as it was.
user1: I love how it's as much for adults as it is for kids too. Very cool.
user1: I had no idea it got 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, though. I can't think of another movie that has been ranked so high! Totally well deserved.
user1: Do you agree with the ratings of this movie?
user1: Are you still there?
user2: yes i do agree with it. i dont like rotten tomatos
user2: but i agree that it should be 100%
user1: All the reviews are pretty consistent, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and CinemaScore. I think the movie and the concept of the movie were just amazingly done. Toys who don't know they're toys? Hilarious.

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?  What movie are we discussing today?
user1: Hello. We are discussing Toy Story
user2: That's a great movie but I have not seen it for so long.  Can you tell me more about it?
user1: This movie came out in 1995 and is an animated child movie. The main character has the voice of Tom Hanks. Are you familiar with him?
user2: Yes, he's a great actor.  I didn't know he did Woody
user1: Yes he did. The "secondary" main character is Buzz Lightyear that's voiced by Tim Allen. I'm sure you know who that is?
user2: Yeah Home Improvement.  Sounds like they have a lot of talent in that movie
user1: They really do. The toys are owned by a kid named Andy who's moving to a new house and of course he's going to take his toys with him.
user2: oh yeah, and what ends up happening
user1: Throughout the movie I believe the toys are trying to not get left behind but Andy can only take so many toys (it's been so long that I myself can't remember all the details)
user2: yeah I can't either, just rremember it being good.  Isn't there some jealousy between Woody and Buzz
user2: like who's Andy's favorite toy or something
user1: Yeah Woody and Buzz fight with each other because Andy got Buzz as a present and he's much cooler than Woody. A lot of jealousy over who's Andy's favorite toy.
user2: yeah that's what I thought.  but they end up resolving things I think right
user1: I want to say they do end up resolving things but I can't remember exactly how, unfortunately.
user2: I don't either
user1: Do you remember any of the other characters like Mr. Potato Head, The Piggy Bank, Dinosaur?
user2: yes!!! so funny
user1: So Buzz accidently gets knocked out of the window by Woody and all the rest of the toys turned against him lol
user2: oh y eah!!! and the bully gets him
user1: Yep LOL.
user1: One of the funniest parts is when Buzz gets stuck in the crane game with the little aliens
user2: tes I remember that
user1: So on moving day Buzz and Woody have to use the RC car to try to get on the moving truck because they got left behind from dealing with the bully's dog. Even though the RC car's batteries died while trying to do it, luckily Buzz's rocket on his back saved theme
user1: them*
user2: I had forgotten the ending
user2: how clever
user1: At the end Andy ends up getting a dog (which is worse than a Buzz, as far as being jealous) and Woody & Buzz realize that things weren't so bad
user1: Are you still there?
user2: yes I'm so sorry, I got a call from a doctor with some critical info about one of my kids
user2: so they make up at the end right?
user1: No problem at all and I hope everything is well..

conversation:
user2: This movie is about toys that pretend not to be alive when people are around.
user2: Have you seen a movie like this?
user1: The two main characters are toys of different eras. Woody is an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll, while Buzz is a state if the art astronaut toy representing the progression of technology while Woody represents more old fashioned analog technologies.  Eventually the two become friends and the message is old an new can work together to make something even better than either of them are on their own. 
user2: Yes.  Did you enjoy this movie?
user1: I did.  Of course, Disney Pixar are experts at pulling on everyone's heart strings. 
user1: Did you enjoy the movie?
user2: It was a movie that did that.  I really like movies like this. They are really good for children and adults.
user1: Exactly. I loved this movie when I was little, and still, love it when I am now an adult. 
user2: I do too.  It is a classic movie that will stand the test of time.
user1: Absolutely. The animation is now considered a little outdated and new movies are better aesthetically,but when it comes down to it, nothing will ever surpass the popularity of the classic Disney movies. 
user1: I've never met someone who didn't like toy story. 
user2: I agree.  They have a way with creating amazing characters.  Just look at Woody and how he and Buzz become friends.
user1: Yes it is a classic story model, of the rivals that eventually become the best of friends, but Disney has a way of making it feel fresh and new, and not overdone. 
user2: I agree.  I also think they pick good voices for their characters.  Just like they picked Tom Hanks for Woody.
user1: Yes, those two are like America's dads. They have very trustworthy voices. 
user2: I also think that the secondary characters like Mr. Potato Head and Slinky Dog really add to the enjoyment of the movie.  They give you the comic relief that is needed to make this movie fun and enjoyable.
user1: Comic relief is very important, but it is a bad movie that relies solely on comedic moments to carry the storyline.  Toy story doesn't do that. 
user2: No.  It takes the kid in all of us through a ride toward two characters friendship.  I agree with you that they made that common story plot and made it fresh.  It is amazing how creators can make such amazing ways to convey themes like this.
user1: It is clear that most people agree on that, based on it's ratings. 100%, 9/10, and 95/100. Everyone enjoys this movie. 
user2: Yes.  I think I that when they describe scenes like when Woody gets upset and thinks that Buzz is becoming the favorite toy, people can see it in their heads.  They can see Woody trying to get Buzz stuck behind the desk.
user1: Exactly. Envy and jealousy are very human emotions. Ones that viewers can really relate to. It is clear that woody just doesn't want to be replaced and that is clear from the very beginning when all the toys set up a recon operation at the birthday party to ensure that the presents he receives don't replace them. 
user2: I think that it is a novial idea to have Buzz think he is a real space ranger.  It gives the story depth that other plots of this type don't have because he is unknowingly making the other toys like him.
user1: It makes me wonder if the other toys thought they were real cowboys, dinosaurs, and potatoes when they first came out of the box. But Buzz sticking to his guns and refusing to break character or acknowledge that he is not a space ranger is what makes him so endearing. 
user2: I think I would like to think that they all thought they were real cowboys, etc.  It gives it a more dynamic thought process to it.  
user1: I do too. Also the scene towards the end of the movie where Woody is insisting that Buzz can't fly and Buzz says "we're not flying were falling with style" implies that he finally realizes that he isn't a space ranger he is a toy.  And maybe all toys go through this adjustment process. 
user2: Yeah.  I also am thinking about the scene at the end of the movie where they find go recon Andy's gifts at Christmas.  They give each other worried smiles when they see it's a puppy.  I would like them to be thinking about how to incorporate this pooch into the mix of toys.
user1: Its the same worried look that woody had at the beginning of the movie when Buzz was unwrapped, but now he has someone to share it with, who feels the same way. 
user2: It is now that I think about it.  Completely the same look.  
user2: Did you watch more Pixar movies because of your enjoyment with this movie?
user1: Exactly the same look. They are both dismayed but they eventually come around to the dog, as we see in the second movie.  yes, I love Disney and Pixar movies and I remember seeing Toy story when I was very little and have been watching ever since. 
user2: Well, thank you for a lovely conversation about this movie.  It has been very enjoyable talking to you.

conversation:
user2: Hi. Have you seen Toy Story?
user1: Yes, have you?
user2: Yes. Did you enjoy it? 
user1: Yep, I really like that Walk Disney Pictures produced it.
user1: What do you think about the critical responses?
user2: I do too. I also really enjoyed the music by randy Newman. I agree with the critical responses 
user1: Better yet, what do you think about Woody and Andy's relationship? Wish I had a friend like that.
user2: I agree. I enjoyed playing with toys similar to those in the movie
user1: They had a lot of good characters. My favorite was Rex played by Wallace Shawn.
user2: I liked Rex as well. I think my favorite was Slinky Dog, played by Jim Varney. 
user1: Yep, the dachshund slinky toy. He was cool. 
user1: Great character for showing how each toy has it's own character like the critics said.
user2: I agree. I was also surprised to read that Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 100%. 
user1: I'm not surprised. I think we need more movies like Toy Story to illustrate the freedom of imagination and creativity.
user2: Reading the critic reviews makes me want to watch it again. 
user2: I think so as well. Cartoons nowadays do not seem as well done. 
user1: YEP. However, I'm surprised it's listed as a comedy.
user1: I think it's safe to say that we've all had our Woody moments where we think we are more than what we are.
user2: Yes, I did not realize that. I did not know that it was the first feature film produced by Pixar. 
user2: I agree. I think we all take on more than we can handle at times and then rely on our friends for support. 
user1: It's not until reality hits, like it did when Woody and Buzz Lightyear gets separated from Andy and his family, do we come to realize we are limited to the support of those around us. Teamwork is everything.
user1: I didn't know baby monitors could be so versatile. The toys used them to report to other toys.
user2: Yes, I also liked the creativity of escaping the bad situations in the movie that the characters faced. 
user2: Like using the RC 
user1: Yep. Ooh and what about how often Buzz and Woody were confronted with conflict. It was nonstop. You see how Sid's dog interfered with their progress.
user2: The green army men are also useful to help them spy as well. 
user2: Yes, they were faced with conflict many times and worked together to overcome it. 
user1: Yes, they were. You ever think they probably could have prepared for more toy sooner if they didn't have so many hiccups?
user1: I would have loved to been Buzz because he had various features.
user1: Which one would you have wanted to be?
user1: You know how hard it must have been for the toys to pretend like they were lifeless when they encountered humans?
user2: Yes. I enjoyed the scene where Buzz shows off his features. I think I would've wanted to be Woody. 
user1: Then we could have worked together!
user2: I think it would've been very hard for them to put everything back in place so that the humans would not notice. Yes, we could have! 
user2: Sid's dog also must have been horrifying for them to encounter. 
user1: YES!
user1: He chased them so bad. That had to be difficult for them
user2: I also felt bad for Woody at times since he did not have as many features as Buzz. 
user2: Andy had to choose between them at times, which must have been hard. 
user1: The other toys thought differently of Woody afterwards
user1: Of course, and then the puppy came!
user1: I wonder what Director John Lasseter is doing now,
user1: seems like he had a firm grip on creativity.
user2: At least the puppy was something the both of them would have to work through together. 
user2: Yes, that is true. 
user1: Slinky Dog and Woody made quite the duo, though.
user2: Yes, I enjoyed Slinky Dog's character. 
user1: I wish the family never stopped for gas, though.
user1: Then Buzz wouldn't have had to hitchhike. 
user2: Yes, or moved. 
user2: Did you know that one of the executive producers was Steve Jobs? 
user1: I'm with Woody in questioning what could be worse that Buzz Lightyear after all of their issues. I think I'm satisfied with the end result
user1: No I didn't. Totally a fun fact there.
user2: I am satisfied with the end results as well. 
user1: What I'd give to eat at Pizza Planet. Sounds like our version of Chuck E Cheese.
user2: Yes, I had never thought about that before
user1: Me either

conversation:
user2: Hi! I love the movie Toy Story! Have you seen it?
user1: It is a goodies
user1: Seen it a couple times
user2: I've seen it a lot of times with my kids. But secretly, I like ti anyway!
user1: Hanks is great as Woody
user2: He is. He has a great rapport with Tim Allen as well.
user1: The film really needs comdians to do the voices
user2: They bring an added layer of entertainment for the adults watching as well
user1: I was surprised Don Riclkles was in it, he is really old
user2: He passed away recently I think.
user1: Ya very sad
user2: I really enjoyed the birthday party scene eith the green army men.
user1: Varney plays the slinky dog well to
user1: I dont recall the party well
user2: It was hilarious! I love how they used a baby monitor to report back to the toys in the bedroom what new gifts the little boy was getting.
user1: So they found out a new toy was coming? Buzz
user2: Yes. And the dinosaur (who is played hilariously by Wallace Shawn) knocks the batteries out of the monitor. lol!
user1: There was a good bit of slap stick in the film
user2: There was! 
user1: Great film, a lot of fun
user2: I thought the scenes with Sid were kind of scary though
user1: Which one was Sid
user2: The mean kid from next door
user1: Oh ya
user1: Got to have a real villian
user2: He liked to cut up toys and rearrange them. But the toys he was mean to ended up saving Woody and Buzz eventually
user1: Nice
user1: I have not seen this in many years
user2: It's been a while since I've seen it. But I've seen it dozens of times.
user1: It was the first Pixar film with full animation
user1: Made Pixar famous
user2: And what a start it was for them! They've been almost unstoppable since!
user1: You got that right!
user1: Wish I had stock in Disney back then
user2: That would be nice!
user1: Live and dream
user2: Thanks for chatting!
user1: Ok Thanks

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello, nice talking to you.
user1: Have you seen Toy Story animation movie?
user2: Yes, I have
user1: It is an amazing movie. It got 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 95 Metacritic Score. Which is very high
user2: I loved, as a kid, i's been a while since i've seen it
user1: You should see it again. It has two main characters Woody and Buzz
user2: They're voiced by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen right?
user1: Yes that is right. And they are toys that have life when no human is close. 
user2: Yeah, I remember
user2: Who did the score for the movie?
user1: Woody is Andy's preferred toy until Buzz arrived. After that everything change and they initiate a competition for Andy's preference. 
user1: As an extra ingredient Andy is going to move in a few weeks so they are afraid to be left.
user2: Did you know Steve Jobs was involved in this movie?
user1: Also the other characters are very funny Mr Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur and other.
user1: No I din't.
user2: Yeah, he was a producer I think
user2: I loved the music in this movie.
user1: On a certain moment on the film they have to survive in an adventure in a Pizza restaurant and the obstacles they found were really hilarious.
user2: Yeah, I loved that part
user1: And everything gets risky when Andy's neighbor  Sid comes to the history. He is really bad for the toys.
user2: I remember I was creeped out as a kid on that part
user1: Also very funny is that in some situations Buzz really think he is a space ranger. 
user2: Oh yeah.
user1: They had a very adventure trying to get back to Andy's house after all the mess.
user2: Remember the ending on Christmas?
user1: Yes exactly and all the group were trying to help.
user2: What was your favorite character?
user1: For me it was Mr Potato Head.
user2: Mine was Woody.
user1: Ok I hope you see the movie again soon. It is really worth. Nice talking to you
user2: Thanks, bye

conversation:
user1: hi, how's it going
user2: Pretty good how are you?
user1: doing well
user2: That's good
user1: have you ever watched toy story?
user2: Yes I have 
user1: hmm
user1: i'm supposed to convince to watch or not watch the movie
user1: *convince you
user2: Ok so fill me in on what it's about 
user1: it's a movie from the mid-90s about a couple of toys
user1: they're actually alive and talk with each other, but pretend to be lifeless when humans are nearby
user2: Ok so it's obviously a children's movie
user1: yep, animated film
user2: Ok what are some of the names of the characters and what roles do they play
user1: the main characters are woody, a pull-string character doll
user1: buzz lightyear, a space ranger action figure
user1: there's also other side characters, like mr potato head and the slinky dog
user1: there's a specific scene in the beginning where the owner of the toys, a six year old named andy, is having a birthday party
user1: woody gets the toys together to scout the party, since they're worried that some of them will be replaced
user1: in the beginning, they're relieved, but then andy receives a surprise gift (buzz lightyear)
user1: any questions so far?
user2: Ok you said they are surprised when buzz shows up...like good surprises or bad surpised?
user1: when i said surprise, i mean it's a surprise gift
user1: not actually surprised
user2: Oh ok what kind of adventures do they end up on
user1: so andy starts to play with buzz more, since buzz has a bunch of cool features
user2: Ok and I'm assuming that upsets the other toys how do they react to that 
user1: when preparing to go to a family outing, andy is only allowed to bring one toy
user2: Which one does he choose
user1: so woody gets jealous and accidentally knocks buzz out the window
user1: andy grabs woody, and they go to pizza planet
user2: Oh ok to make sure Andy doesn't choose buzz 
user2: What's pizza planet
user1: it's a restaurant chain in the movie
user1: anyway, buzz ends up hitching a ride with them

user1: very advanced for its time
user1: yeah pixar is in a league of its own
user2: I didn't realize that Steve Jobs was involved in the production of the movie
user1: yeah not many people even know he spearheaded pixar
user1: good person to have haha
user2: oh wow I didn't know that either.
user1: yeah and then sold it to pixar
user1: pretty crazy
user2: It looks like it got fantastic ratings and reviews in 1995
user1: yeah what do you think of the 100% on rotten tomatos?
user2: A, 9/10, and 95
user1: think it deservess it?
user2: From what I've seen over the years rotten tomatoes is pretty critical of movies. Maybe because of the animation back in the day but these days it wouldn't have gotten that high.
user2: I was surprised at the 100%
user1: yeah definitely
user1: for the time it derserves it for sure
user2: The storyline in scene 2 is so complex, i never really thought about it but its different when you read it vs see it 
user1: as for todays time it holds up but not as great as it was then
user1: yeah
user1: especially since i was younger then
user2: I knew Tim Allen was Woody buy honestljy didn't realize that Tom Hanks was the voice of Buzz
user1: oh wow
user1: yeah he did a great job
user2: I don't remember the part about Christmas and getting a new puppy
user1: as with everything he does
user1: yeah its at the very end
user1: to end the movie
user2: Theres 3 total toy stories right?
user1: kind of a nod to another movie possibility
user1: yeah theres 3
user1: and i was hearing theres going to be a 4th
user2: Disney and Pixar Seem to do that alot if you go back and look. they give glimpses to movies that are in the works but might not come out for years
user2: a 4th? seems like a long length of time in between, kind of out of date for the movies now
user1: yeah it seems to be in every movie
user1: and yeah true but the third was really good and came out after around 10 yearts
user1: thanks for talkin!

conversation:
user1: hi this movie sounds great I mean 9/10 ratings that is pretty epic for a movie and 100% on rotten tomatos
user2: Yeah, wow! Pixar first full length feature!
user1: not to mention being a comedy animation and adventure in one
user2: I like the critical response about the scene when Buzz realizes he's a toy.
user1: yeah that is a good part and critical responses are something to view what is good and what isn't
user1: i liked the term razzle dazzle myself because it gives an unusual look they say
user2: Razzle Dazzle is a great description! Plus I really like the voice cast! They got some big names like Tom Hanks to do it!
user2: I can just see Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, too.
user1: haha yeah and tom hanks is the best part of the movie i think hands down of the cast choices
user2: It kind of surprised me that this was done in 1995, which is 23 years ago.
user1: yeah same but that makes it a classic worth seeing it seems based on everything read
user2: Yeah,totally a classic worth seeing! 
user1: i love when they talk about its the work of genius it tells you that the plot and the story itself on top of the ratings tell you it is a must see movie
user2: I guess I might sort of bugged about that, except in this case, it's probably true. Interesting that Steve Jobs was a producer on it. I am guessing that this is THE Steve Jobs from Apple.
user1: you know I did not catch that until you mentioned it but wow I would think the man from apple as well. Well that being said it might make this a even more must-see because I never knew the man did anything more than computers
user2: So the last reviewer puts this movie in his top ten list. Would it be in your top 10 list of movies? Or maybe top 10 list of kids' movies?
user1: that is a good question I mean I would think movies in general honestly based on the ratings itself I mean I wouldn't separate it into kids movies due to the rating cause very few movies get that kind of rating from rotten tomatoes.
user2: Great points! I love how Disney movies always have life lessons for kids and adults. The relationship evolution between Buzz and Woody and the lessons about jealousy when Buzz shows up are great messages for all of us.
user2: Plus the humor appeals to kids and adults.
user1: I do agree disney movies are really great for doing that. I love that with this story, in particular, it gives you an idea that imagination happens. The fact that these toys are lifeless around humans present but alive when they are gone is a great touch to the imagination in our every day lives as kids. But yes the humor appeals to everyone so that's what drags us adults into them as well
user2: What a great job to make a living using your imagination to come up with stories like this! And then write the dialogue. The one reviewer talked about the toys being true to their character. It's a real gift to be able to bring toys to life!
user1: I normally don't sit down and watch movies these days like this one but this movie is worth every minute of time. It's too interesting not to watch no matter your age. but I do agree to be able to do this for a living making something so artistic is a dream come true.
user2: Plus the scenarios they come up with like being trapped in a crane game, knocking Buzz out of the window, etc. How fun and how much they really make this movie great.
user1: when the family left without them after getting gas though was a kind of sad part in the movie to me. I mean I still think the movie is great but it is still a sad point.
user2: I suppose every great movie makes us feel a range of emotions. What a triumph when Buzz and Woody use the rocket and then glide to a safe landing!
user1: But the part that I did love that was pretty funny was when woody and buzz couldn't imagine a new toy being worse than buzz then they see its a puppy i laughed at their expressions on their face when they looked so worried
user1: oh yes i was so happy they made a safe landing we didn't need a tragedy to happen :)
user2: Yeah, that was a great moment! I wondered if we would get a sequel to this movie. I hope, I hope!
user1: That would be great if we did. I think the director John Lasseter did an amazing job with this movie and writing technique.
user2: I wondered if the puppy would get to see the toys in action or if they go lifeless for the puppy, too. I agree that the director did a super job! It makes me want a Toy Story 2.
user1: sam here and yeah would be kind a cool to see if they talk to the puppy or if they can communicate or not

conversation:
user1: What movie are we talking about?
user2: Hello,
user1: Hey

user2: I have watched Toy Story. Again.
user1: I have watched it as well
user1: What did you like about it?
user2: It's from 1995.
user2: For that time it looks pretty okayish.
user1: Understood it had Tom Hanks in it. Which was major for the time
user2: Well, Tom Hanks voice. And Tim Allen as Buzz.
user2: I saw Tim Allen as more fitting.
user1: Walt Disney Pictures really had a budget for all these actors/actresses
user2: It went pretty well for the critics, too.
user2: When I think about it, I even liked Rex the most.
user1: Said it was "a work of genius" Which, for the time, is accurate
user2: I didn't like the boy.
user1: Sid
user2: Andy Davis.
user1: He was an interesting antagonist
user1: Oh
user1: Why not?
user2: He just felt to childish for me. Maybe that is okay as he is 6, but I just didn't like him.
user1: I liked Sarge
user2: So, yes. I guess I liked the antagonist sid more.
user2: Yes, Sarge is a good man.
user1: Great soldier and leader
user1: I wonder if its the same Steve Jobs from Apple?
user2: A green soldier.
user1: So christimas day is when they got a new house...thats cool
user1: Sid & Scud...what a named duo
user2: I would not want to move on christmas.
user1: Maybe its refreshing for the toys after beign harrassed by sid and scud
user2: Yes, Sid and Scud belong together.
user1: If RC is alive like all other toys do batteries even matter?
user2: Buzz should have gotten some working features after all.
user2: Ohh, Goodnight. See yoo tomorrow.
user1: Buzz's Wings came in handy
user1: peace
user2: Yes, the wings did work.

user2: Can you tell me about it?
user1: We take turns chatting for 15 turns, then they will compensate us
user2: Yeah, I know. 
user2: Who is in it
user1: It was an animated film. It had Buzz light year and woody
user1: Tom hanks was woody
user2: Cool
user1: Tim Allen was Buzz lightyear
user2: I like both of them
user1: It also had mr. and mrs. potato head
user1: it is such a cute movie
user1: I think they made like 3 or 4 of them
user2: Who was Mr potato head?
user1: Woody was Andy (the human kids) favorite toy. Then one day his mom gets him a new Buzz toy. Andy no longer really plays with Woody. 
user2: Great story
user1: Woody tries to get rid of Buzz.
user2: sounds like a great story
user1: Andy is moving and Woody throughs Buzz out the window. 
user1: Andy doesn't notice until it is too late. 
user1: Woody and his friends wind up feeling really bad and try to go back to save Buzz
user2: Who are some of the other voices? 
user1: looks like Don Rickles was the potato head
user2: Ha! great choice
user1: jim varney was the slinky dog
user2: hilarious
user1: and wallace shawn as rex
user1: It was cute and funny!
user2: the dinosaur?
user1: You should totally check it out
user1: Yes, the dino
user2: I will check it out
user1: thanks for chatting with me!
user2: Thank you!, have a great day
user1: you too!

conversation:
user1: What do you think about this movie?
user2: it sounds really cute. How about you?
user1: Yeh, Looks like a fun movie to see with the kids and I love Tom Hanks
user2: The characters are different and it's a lively film. T
user2: Tom Hanks is great! 
user1: Was very modern for a 1995 film
user2: I love how creative it was. 
user1: And Pixar animations are always great
user2: They are! The animation is top notch and the story is always good. 
user1: Mr potato head is my favorite actor
user1: I had one when I was a child
user2: Mr Potatohead was awesome! 
user1: And the rating in all sites are pretty high
user2: I love the adventure and elements of danger the toys had to endure throughout the film. 
user1: Yes, and also how they stop the action when humans show up
user2: It's a captivating story and so funny!
user2: I can't see the end of your sentenc... When do they stop the action?
user2: Oh! The humans show up! Yes! Hilarious!!!
user1: Have you seen that Steve jobs was the executive producers?
user1: One of them 
user2: I've always like Wallace Shawn, the voice of T Rex. He did a great job of bringing that plastic dinosaur to life in this movie. 
user1: Very interesting! I didn’t know it
user2: I didn't see that about Steve Jobs. 
user1: Is in the introduction box
user2: Neither did I! 
user1: Yeh, Wallace is great
user2: I didn't even know he did movie production. 
user1: Yeh, his was a genius in everything, even movie production 
user2: I had forgotten all about the horrible neighborhood kid, Sid. I felt like his character was a little over the top. 
user2: I'm having a hard time seeing what you're saying. The chat window isn't advancing as we add posts. So sorry if I'm missing some.
user1: Very true
user1: I know my screen is shifting too
user2: Well Steve Jobs is a smart and savvy guy. I wish I was half as successful 
user2: Yeah Sid was way too cruel and twisted. I'm a grown up and he fracked me out! I can just imagine what little kids must've felt watching him.
user1: Probably he was inspired in a real bully
user1: But in 1995 they did not call bully yet I guess, it is a newer term
user2: I didn't realize Jim Varney was the slinky dog! That's hilarious! 
user1: Yes! Very funny 
user2: I bet Sid was based on real bully behavior. Some kids can be so mean!
user2: He did a great job, too!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello
user1: I love the movie Toy Story! Have you sen it?
user2: I have seen it I love it too. It was a game changer in the animation industry
user1: It absolutely was. Technical merit aside, the cast was astounding! Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were wonderful together.
user2: They really were. I thought the visual direction of the film was a really original idea, some would say genius.
user1: I agree. Telling the story from the perspective of the toys was so imaginative.
user1: I love how they become friends despite being so competitive in the beginnig. It's a great message.
user2: It really was. It was also surprising to find out that Joss Whedon worked on it, the guy who directed some of the newer marvel movies. 
user1: I always forget that Joss Whedon was involved! It seems so different for him.
user2: Definitely! I wonder too if the Joel Cohen who worked on it was one of the Cohen brothers. The brother duo who directed Burn after Reading and The Big Lebowski?
user1: Oh, that's a really good question. I never thought of that. One of my favorite scenes has to be the birthday party and how the army men are relaying back to the bedroom what's happening as the new gifts are being unwrapped.
user2: That part was hilaroius!
user1: One of the most clever things I think is how they work with the materials they have to replicate real-world tools. Like the baby monitors as walkie-talkies! So funny!
user2: Ya that was really inventive
user2: This might be too deep but I wonder if the toys trying to fight for Andy's attention is a way to communicate to children and specifically siblings that their parents love them equally no matter how much we try to impress them?
user1: That would make sense. I mean, they are all family. When it comes time for Any and his family to move away, they all come together to support him. So it makes sense that even though they're family, they have little spats like siblings would.
user2: Definitely I think that makes sense
user1: Of course, Woody realizes his mistake and that they are all truly family when the mean kid steals Buzz.
user2: The scenes where Sid remakes the toys and combines them scared me as a child. 
user1: Oh my goodness, yes that was scary!
user2: I think Don Rickles, who was the voice for mister potato head passed away recently too.
user1: I heard that! But I hadn't made the connection that he was Mister Potato Head.
user2: Its always funny when a really crass comedian plays the voice for a kids movie!
user1: It is! The comedy in general in the movie is spot on! I love how they bookend the movie with another recon mission at Christmas. And this time they get a puppy!!
user2: I love how that scene where Buzz flies through the air during the car chase inspired all of us to think our toys could actually fly if we through them hard enough.
user1: Oh, he was so happy when he flew in that scene. And all that just after he had just realized that he actually was a toy and couldn't really fly. 
user2: Oh man the puppy moment was priceless. Its funny that watching it even as an adult its like watching another movie. You recognize so many different levels of connection and communication that you missed as a kid.
user2: Totally!
user1: Toy Story, and Disney movies in general are like that. They work on so many levels. Levels you don't necessarily understand as a kid.
user2: For sure, its awesome that Pixar did it so well with their first movie.

conversation:
user2: How'd you like Toy Story
user2: ?
user1: Amazing how they managed to get all those top names in acting to participate.
user2: I know, who was your favorite character ? Mine is Jesse.
user1: Was Jesse in the original Toy Story?
user1: I liked Mr. Potato Head.  He even looked a little like Don Rickles.  But that may have been me projecting.
user2: He's a cool character. 
user2: What was your favorite scene ?
user2: It got a really high score on rotten tomatoes. Impressive!
user1: I love the quote "a work of genius".  Too bad there is nothing to say who these supposed critics are. 
user1: I'm not saying it wasn't a work of genius, just that quotes taken out of context could have been taken from the director's family!
user1: They are also claiming it was often more interesting to adults than kids.  Do you think that was the case?  I am not sure that is necessarily a compliment

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Good morning
user2: Ever seen the film 'Toy Story'?
user1: i did but i will pretend i didn't
user1: :)
user1: what year did it come out
user2: Nice one... Back in 1995, if you can believe that.
user1: who is the director?
user2: John Lasseter, though I have never heard of him...
user1: me neither
user2: This was Pixar's first film
user1: i LOVE pixar's movies!
user1: what about the ratings? are the ratings good?
user2: It got great ratings - Rotten Tomatoes has 100%, Metacritic 95/100, and CinemaScore: A.
user2: Not surprising at all, from what I remember of it
user1: I've never seen rotten tomatoes giving 100% rating!
user2: I cannot remember ever seeing that myself, either
user1: What kind of movie is it?
user1: genre?
user2: Comedy mostly, but also animation
user1: do you think this movie is only good for kids or adults would enjoy it as well?
user2: Does not give its running length, but it is probably around 100 minutes
user1: ok
user2: Definitely a family film
user2: My kid still watches it, her mom loves it too
user1: can you tell me what this movie is about? just in general
user2: The movie is about toys. They act lifeless whenever people are around, but when they are alone, they come to life
user1: that sounds interesting
user1: what about cast?
user2: The two main toys, Woody and Buzz Lightyear, sort of have a rivalry during the film, competing for the kid's attention
user1: nice! thank you for chatting with me. have a great day
user2: Great cast, Tom Hanks is the voice of Woody, Tim Allen is the voice of Buzz, and there are others too
user2: You too :)

conversation:
user1: When was this film released?
user2: This film was released 1995
user1: Oh that's right. Are you a fan of Toy Story?
user2: Not yet but will enjoy the preview
user1: Well 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, not a bad score...
user2: Children loved this type of film, espeicially the audio
user1: Buzz Lightyear has always been a big hit. Tim Allen does a grave job doing the voice.
user2: Wasnt there some other films they did there voiec work on as well?
user1: Pretty sure there is. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are well known actors.
user1: 1995 was decades ago, but this movie never gets old 
user2: Those two also star in an sequel I am not sure if they starred in Toy Story 3 
user1: Do you know who owned the toys?>
user1: the name of the child
user2: The toys were delivered to an daycare center
user1: Oh all right. It is funny how Buzz Lightyear thinks he is not a you, but an actual space ranger
user1: *toy
user2: They were to be presented for Andy's birthday
user1: Yeah the toys didn't like that because they did not want to be replaced
user2: How do you lose an animated character in an Pixar film by Disney?
user1: how?
user1: What woody did to Buzz was straight jealousy, do you agree> 
user1: *?
user2: Is there any type of check-up on this task?

conversation:
user2: hii

user1: i loved it
user2: me too
user2: screenplay by Joss whedon and others
user1: really
user1: no kidding?
user2: yeah
user1: i had no idea
user2: me neither

conversation:
user2: hiii
user1: Hello there. Who was your favorite Toy Story character?
user2: Without a doubt Buzz , and you?
user1: Mine too! Do you think this is one of the best children's movies made so far?
user2: Well, if it is not the best, it was the one that revolutionized this entire industry, we see how I fall in love not only with the children's community, but also with the critics
user1: Yes the critics gave it almost a perfect score. Do you think it will have any more sequels?
user2: I do not know if they should, it would be like exploiting a lot of the saga ... but I know that they will be released very soon, even cast so it would be worth it for them and for the fans
user1: Was this Tom Hanks only role in a children's movie? He did very well
user2: Hey I think so, but he did great, he always leaves us delighted with all his work, ... and Tim Allen, spectacular
user1: I definitely agree with the critics as far as it being top ten films especially for children.
user1: What would you do if you witnessed your toys come to life as a child?

conversation:
user2: dude
user2: have you seen the "toy story"
user1: i have
user2: I haven't, but I have a brief info about it
user2: So what do you make of the reviews out there?
user1: i think the reviews are spot on

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello, there is a great movie about a pull string cowboy with razzle-dazzle techniques and an unusual look.
user1: This movie sounds familiar as well as interesting. What is the title of this movie because I am interested in watching it!
user2: It's called Toy Story. There is a space ranger action figure, he plays woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend. It's a work of genius. 
user1: Tell me more about what makes it "a work of a genius" 
user2: It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatest children's films. 
user1: What is the main plot about because I am pretty interested in watching this.
user2: It focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, and astronaut action figure, as they compete for the affections of Andy, their owner
user1: Do you know any of the sound actors in the movie? Additionally, is Andy also a toy and in what ways does Andy own said toys?
user2: Characters are voiced by Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. I'm not sure about Andy's status, but his family is preparing to move during the film. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon and Joel Cohen. 
user1: This sounds really great. Is this a show you watched when you were a child? Would you recommend this to my children.
user2: It seems great! Other toys include Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, and Hamm the Piggy Bank
user1: Have you seen this film?
user2: Yes. And the Rotten Tomatoes score is 100%.
user1: Great, it really does sound like it is a great movie. Have they made sequels to this film?
user2: Maybe you can check online but this film got people to understand what toys are about.
user1: How did the film tell you what toys are about? As in, what do you think toys are about?
user2: When buzz impresses Andy, Woody feels left out. Woody attempts to trap Buzz, but knocks him out of a window. Interestingly, Buzz thinks he's a real space ranger and Woody tries to convince him otherwise.
user1: That sounds action-packed. Do you think children give their toys personalities like we give our pets personalities?
user2: I'm not sure, but in this movie Woody fears Andy will choose Buzz over him.
user1: Why does he have to pick one toy or the other?
user2: Its all just out of jealousy. The other toys want to exact revenge on Woody, but then Andy takes him to Pizza Planet.
user1: Tell me something unique about the movie that you have not told me yet?
user2: Buzz gets left behind while trying to rescue Woody when the neighbor Sid's dog chases them. Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well toss him off the truck.
user1: What do you feel when you watch this movie?
user2: It's a work of genius! When the toys see Woody, Buzz, and RC together the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard. 
user1: That great, but what feelings does this movie illicit when you watch it?
user2: Woody ignites a rocket after RC's batteries become depleted. They soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings and they land safely! It has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids.
user1: When you watched this movie as a child, which character in the movie did you most relate with? Why? 

conversation:
user1: hello!
user2: hi
user2: the movie is toy story
user1: I do not have the document in this experiment, so I'll wait to hear from you.
user1: Oh great. 
user1: I have not seen it.
user2: seriously?
user1: correct, i have not seen it
user2: well its about a kid named andy and his toys that come to life
user1: sounds like a good story
user2: the main character is a draw string cowboy doll named woody who is voiced by tom hanks 
user1: i have seen dolls of woody
user1: cute dolls
user2: and also his rival but later becomes his best friend buzz lightyear
user1: yes I have seen buzz characters also
user2: the story is about the evolving relationship between woody and buzz and their shared love for andy 
user1: Sweet!
user1: I'd be glad to hear about a scene in the movie
user2: when a bad mistake leaves woody and buzz stranded and obducted by a terroizing teen named sid who tortures toys for fun they must team together to find their way home.
user2: oh and also andy is moving so they got to do it fast 
user1: funny!
user1: they don't want to lose andy!
user2: and andy doesnt want to loose them!
user1: :)
user1: how old is andy?
user2: buzz lightyear ends up with a rocket strapped to his back and they must use it to fly onto the moving truck 
user1: glad they came up with a plan!
user2: they never say his age but he is around 7 or 8
user2: i assume
user1: i teach elementary school, so would be fun to see a movie with a main character that age!
user2: that would be a fantastic choice for movie day!
user1: indeed!
user1: thanks for telling me about the movie.
user2: this movie came out in 1995 i was only 5 years old at the time so it was very influential in my life 
user2: one of my all time favorite disney films 
user1: great! hope you have a good rest of day!
user2: yes no problem and i hope you get the chance to watch it 
user2: same to you

conversation:
user2: So do you like this genre of movie 
user1: Yes, actually I do like animated films, do you?
user2: Yeah I do I have kids so I watch them alot
user1: It sounds like it is also supposed to be a comedy, so that is a plus
user1: yes, I did when mine were young too
user2: Yeah I like comedies it’s my favorite genre 
user1: Mine too.  It sounds like a lot of drama going on in the film to with the rivalry of the two main characters, lol
user2: It does 
user1: Didn't it say Tom Hanks was the voice of one of them?
user2: What do you think about the actors in this movie 
user2: Yeah I think he’s woody
user1: Well I am a huge Tom Hanks fan and I was just reading where he was one of the main characters so that makes it sound very appealing to me
user1: And as a kid Mr. Potato Head was a favorite toy too
user1: It sounds like one I would like to see, how about you?
user1: I think you are correct.
user2: Yeah I like Tom Hanks too he’s in a lot of movies I like 
user2: Yeah I think it’d be a good movie 
user1: The plot just popped up on the screen so it gives us some insight to the story line. Now I really have to see it!
user1: This Buzz guy sounds like a show off.
user2: Yeah it’s seems like it would be a good movie 
user2: The reviews are high
user1: And it sounds like the cowboy toy maybe kind of gets left behind a little.
user1: Where did you see the reviews?
user1: Was that in the beginning? Oh wait, I see.
user1: Yes, they really are high!
user2: Yeah at the top
user1: I am really impressed with the cast
user2: Yeah a lot of heavy hitters 
user1: I am a little confused as to who Sid is.
user1: I think I missed an important part. lol
user1: Was he maybe a neighbor boy?
user2: Yeah maybe 
user1: Ok, that would make sense then.
user2: I’m not sure
user1: Because it mentions Sid's dog. 
user1: User 2 left the chat. Finish Conversation. 9:01 p.m.

user1: Hello
user2: I love the Toy Story series they are great.
user2: still here
user1: yes it is love the cast and seeing some of my favorite toys 
user1: which was your favorite installment in the series?
user2: Probably the first one when the main character was a small boy and seen the world differently.
user1:  i really enjoyed the first one as well loved the rivalry between woody and buzz. and plus it was something very new
user2: They are great I think they made a new one.
user1: i heard that part 4 was in the making. wonder if they are going to continue with the little girl that has them now. cant wait to see what trouble they get into next. lol
user1: who's your favorite character by the way?
user2: This series could go forever like the Simpsons. Probably Woody he is real funny.
user1: It may just. but i hope they dont do too many because it is hard to keep up such a caliber of work. im tied between woody and buzz. 
user2: Ya me also, They could make a cartoon series on this but it may not be as good. It's great for the entire family.
user1: i feel the same. the shorts that they do once in a while a pretty good. 
user2: Maybe they could do a movie that is not a cartoon with real actors the ones that play the actual roles.
user1: cartoon format fits well for this. i dont think it would work as well or translate as well as spongebob out of the water did.
user2: Sure that is true. These cartoons give people imagination because the world is changing fast.
user1: yeah i think that it would put limitations on their world. especially with the special effects.
user2: It just keeps getting better all the time. 
user2: The cast is so good that is why it works.
user1: yeah with each installment they went further and it worked well especially how woody and buzz relationship evolved
user2: I think Andy is most right? I know he grown up later in the series.
user1: yeah because i think growing up from kids to teenagers we may grow out of playing with ours toys but we always remember them and have a connection to them that takes us back to our childhood. definitely could relate to andy.
user2: That is so true. Great movies and great life time memories.
user1: so which villain did you like best. Lotso was hilarious
user1: loved  how he looked so lovable but he was actually a mob leader of the toys. plus ned beatty voice over was amazing
user2: He was the best hands down.
user2: The voices work well with the cast .
user2: The story of the bear was great .
user1: indeed they do. the casting was well done. probably some of the best casting work in a pixar film. pixar seems to do that well.
user2: Keep them coming .

conversation:

user2: Yes, it's an comedy/action animation
user1: it was released in 1995

user1: A review ranked it as one of their top 10 films
user2: Did you know that this was the first film produced by Pixar
user1: Wallace Shawn played Rex
user2: I laughed at the scene when Woody tried to trap Buzz behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out of a window
user1: I like the scene where Buzz Lightyear is given to Andy
user2: The funniest was the fact that Buzz was believing he's a real space ranger
user1: Buzz even hitched a ride
user2: Do you remember Andy's neighbor, Sid?
user1: Andys birthday party was moved up a week
user2: I'm talking about his neighbor Sid that has a dog named Scud who chased them 
user1: yes they played the crane game
user2: I don't remember it, but i remember the scene with the Remote control car
user1: Do you remember the green army men?
user2: No but i specifically remember a scene where Buzz is trying to escape before a rocket exploded

conversation:
user1: Hi

user1: Yes I have its about toys that are really alive
user2: Yes! I loved the movie
user1: It was pretty good, what parts did you like?
user2: I like when the kids walk in and the toys have to pretend to just be toys again. You?
user1: Ha, those parts are funny. I like the toy crane machine scene. do you remember that part?
user2: Yes I do. That was a good part!
user2: I agree with the rating too
user1: What is the rating?
user2: It was 100 on rotten tomatoes
user1: WoW that is really high
user2: Yes. Its rare to see that score
user2: Do you know what actors play the parts?

user2: Woody is Tom Hanks, Tim Aleen is buzz lightyear
user1: 1995?
user2: YES!
user2: Very high cinema score as well: 95
user1: Because it was really good
user2: that is out of 100
user1: What was the name of the bad kid?
user2: I dont rememeber his name

user2: Let me look.. yes its Sid
user2: He was mean to toys
user1: What did he do to them?
user2: Tore them up and mis matched theri parts
user2: thier
user1: Aw that is mean
user2: Yes it is. Good talking to you. Have a great day!

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hey
user2: whats up
user2: have you seen Toy Story?
user1: Yea
user1: It sucked
user2: WOw
user2: most people would disagree
user2: what didn't you like about it?
user1: Iy was what i thought it would be
user2: What did you think it would be?
user1: I thought it would be entertaining
user2: What part of childrens toys knowing how to talk and developing a relatioinship with a new toy who doesnt think he is a toy wasn't entertaining
user2: was it the whole concept or did you just not like the actors
user2: Tim Allen and Tom Hanks were so charming as Woody and Buzz Lightyear
user1: I thought they had bad performances. Not funny at all.
user2: Wow
user1: Why did you like it?
user2: even the scene where the green army men are spying on the birthday party and the piggy bank knocks the battery out of the baby monitor and the toys panic not knowing if one of them is going to be replaced
user2: Well when I was a kid it was a dream come true to think my toys might come to life when Im not in the room.
user1: That's just a dream. I mean an actual characteristic of the movie. 
user2: Well overall it was a charming buddy comedy featuring two mismatched characters road tripping through a small town in order to get home
user2: featuring obstacles only a toy could face such as dogs
user2: and claw machines
user1: how do you feel about woody?
user2: He started out as a bit of a selfish jerk
user2: and ended up growing to be mroe of a selfless character at the end
user2: taking risks he would never have taken at the start.
user1: I think the character is annoying
user2: Well I guess his voice can be annoying
user2: If you hate Tom Hanks
user1: Yea, he's not good for comedy
user2: you know he started his career in comedy right
user2: and was a prolific comedic actor in the 90's
user1: doesn't mean he was good at it. In my opinion of course.
user1: what was your favorite scene?
user2: My Favorite scenew
user2: was the end where they light the rocket and buzz lgihtyear finally "flys
user1: That was ok i guess

conversation:
user2: I think Toy Story set the trend for animated movies of it's kind, with new technology and famous actors. 
user1: Yes, I think you could say so. It was definitely a first for toys to be depicted in such a way, and it had big name actors like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. 
user2: Yes, I loved how they bring them to life; it's fun and very well made. It's a movie that can be seen by both adults and children. I was still a kid when it came out and still enjoy it. 
user1: I was going to say that two of the critics mention that Toy Story successfully brought the characters to life and this made the movie so successful. Do you think the voice actors and animation contributed to the believability of toys being alive?
user2: Absolutely, both Tim Allen's and Tom Hanks' acting skills are everything. Personally, I cannot think of other actors that would have done such a great voicing job. 
user1: I think the rivalry between the two characters voiced by Allen and Hanks is believable as well, as well as the friendship they develop out of that rivalry.
user2: You can totally relate to their feelings even though they're toys. Do you generally watch these types of movies?
user1: Yes, I enjoy watching animated movies in my free time, especially ones with comedic value.
user2: So do I, especially with everything that's happening in the world, it's nice to have movies like Toy Story that will let you forget and have a good time. 

conversation:
user1: Hi. 
user1: I'm looking for a movie to watch.  
user2: Hey
user1: Do you know any good movies?
user2: I recommend Toy Story, do you like animated films?
user1: I do.  I've never seen Toy Story.  Is it any good?
user2: For its time it was very ambitious. It's a great movie for both kids and adults.
user1: Sounds good.  Who is in it?
user2: Tom Hanks plays Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure.
user2: Don Rickles and Jim Varney are both in it play as Mr. Potato Head and a Slinky dog, respectively.
user1: I like both of those actors.  
user1: What's the plot about?
user2: In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present,a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy'sbirthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, arepreparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-stringcowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep theshepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog,into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report theresults to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to endwith none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – anelectronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actualspace ranger.
user1: I'd like to watch it, I think.  
user1: When was it released?
user2: As a kid I remember it being a really fun movie since it keeps changing themes throughout the movie. Rotten Tomatoes scored it a 100% and averaging 9/10 from most critics.
user2: It was originally released in 1995.
user1: Okay, that's a great score.  I've never seen an RT score of 100% before.  
user2: They're rare to come by, especially these days! I haven't seen the 3rd movie, but the 2nd was pretty memorable.
user1: Did it win any awards?
user2: It was awarded a few notable ones, but not as many as it was nominated for, unfortunately.
user1: What is, unfortunate.  
user1: How long is it?  I'll need to block off some time in my schedule to see it.
user2: It's unfortunate that the movie was nominated for more awards than it actually won.
user1: How long is the movie?
user2: The movie's length is about 1.5 hours - perfect for a time killer between daily tasks.
user1: Yeah. I'll be able to find time to watch it tomorrow.  That sounds great.  
user2: I might have to as well, need to get caught up for the 3rd film.
user1: Thanks.  
user2: Your welcome, I think we have a few more turns in this conversation. I'll use it to describe some of the scenes.
user1: That's not necessary.  

conversation:
user2: hi 
user2: have you watched the movie before
user2: its one of my favorite movie
user2: it got 100% rating on rotten tomatoes 
user2: and 9/10 on IMDb 
user2: its really hard to get that much rating
user1: hello
user2: it got very popular among kids
user1: Yeah, it's really hard to get that high of an imdb rating.
user1: Do you like Tom Hanks?
user2: i like him very much 
user2: his voice bring life to his movie
user1: I like his voice too
user1: Not the biggest Tim Allen fan
user1: but I liked him in this movie
user2: i like the idea when toys were picturized as lifeless in human presence
user1: yeah funny
user1: and it's actually a really good story
user1: not just for an animated movie
user2: iit was first computerized animated movie made by pixar
user1: pixar rocks
user1: I hate that Disney bought them out
user1: Don't trust Disney
user1: I didn't know that was Don Rickles
user2: yea
user2: exactly
user2: i love pixar studio
user2: they worked hard 
user1: Wall-E is my fave
user2: and use high CGi effects
user2: yes 
user2: wall-e was oscar winning movie
user1: I like that the T Rex was nuerotic
user1: Wall-E is one of the best all time
user2: yes
user2: obviously
user1: 1995
user1: Hard to believe this was 23 years ago
user2: what did you like most in toy story ?
user1: the innocence of Buzz
user1: his good intentions
user1: his earnestness
user1: and it was consistently funny
user2: yes
user2: it was
user1: what did you like best?
user2: Time to leave now, will catch up soon :)

conversation:
user2: Hey there1!
user1: Hello
user2: Have you finished reading the document?
user1: Yes
user1: It's about Toy Story
user2: Oh cool, i loved Toy Story as a kid. Did you watch any of the sequels?
user1: Yes, they're great movies with an awesome voice cast.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the best.
user2: I think the original was probably my favorite. And i couldn't agree more. I wish those two were still making movied together.
user2: movies*
user2: I might have to go and rewatch Toy Story, it's been way to long since i last saw it. 
user1: Same here, I want to rewatch all of them.
user2: Totally should. I imagine they sell the whole series for pretty cheap at department stores like Target or WalMart. how long was the doc they made you read?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: how are you?
user1: Good Morning Im Doing well
user2: Have you seen Toy Story before?
user1: The movie we will be discussing today is Toy Story. Yes I have seen it plenty of times the movie is great
user1: The original is probably my favorite although I enjoyed both of the sequels
user2: I have seen it many time as well-my kids love it!
user1: I read that they are in production of Toy Story 4. I cant wait
user2: I agree with you, I love number 1 the best, I felt that the 3 rd one was just ok
user1: The idea is brilliant. A story revolved around the daily life of toys and action figures when no one is looking
user2: I know, love woody and the Trex!
user2: Little bo peep lady is pretty funny too-very flirty!
user2: I loved the rescue operation at the toy store!
user2: And Mr and Mrs potato heads!:-)
user1: Yes Trex was a great addition my favorite was probably Buzz or the army men. Me and my little brother would always crack up at the end of the movie when Woody reveals to Sid that the toys are real. So Play Nice !!!
user1: Yes the potato heads were great
user1: Tom Hanks was on a roll. Toy Story came out the following year after forrest Gump. I dont know where he even found time to do the role
user2: He loses his parts and Mrs Potato head helps him put them back in:-)
user2: Tom Hanks was very good
user2: so was Tim Allen
user2: very expressive
user2: Such a great animation for both, kids and adults!
user1: Lmao There\s a snake in my boots haha. I just hope they dont ruin a good thing by trying to do one more movie. It seems like Hollywood is running out of ideas. 
user1: Yes Toy Story is one of the few animated films where a adult doesnt feel silly for watching it 
user2: True, maybe they will make a version that the boy has kids of his own now and they have his toys
user2: or something like that
user1: yea that would be cool, I think in the last one he was already in college I thought that would have been the end of it there lol
user2: yes, He donated his toys to a day care place? And some little girl got it... Oh well, I'm sure they can come up with something:-)
user1: A 100% on the rotten tomatoes rating is pretty good as well. 
user1: Yes hollywood always does
user2: Yes, I agree with that, it's a great animation, I like the music in it and all the humor
user1: Yea the soundtrack was great. I just to sing the theme song, You got a friend in me so much my parents got annoyed and threatened to break my vhs tape 
user2: Yes, that was very good, and the sad song of how the doll was left behind by her favorite girl...
user1: Yea that scene was brutal, even the villian in the third movie. No one wants to be just discarded away like that, it was great seeing it from a different perspective 
user2: I like the whole adventure with the evil neighbor boy who was torturing his poor toys!

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hello
user1: Great movie
user2: So you like Toy Story?
user1: yes, I think it appeals to all ages.
user1: Did you?
user2: My family liked it as well.
user2: The ratings seem to agree with use as Rotten Tomatoes has it at 100%
user1: yes, great story, and I think the actors fit the parts well
user2: Agreed.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen seem to work real well together.
user1: The animation they do in movies is pretty amazing.
user2: It has come a long way for sure.
user2: I liked how the movie incorporated older toys that I played with when I was younger
user2: Very nostalgic. 
user1: yes
user1: I think there were a few great messages in the story as well
user2: For sure.
user2: One of my favorite characters was Mr. Potato Head.
user1: Prob the best one for me is work together, create some teamwork and get the job done.
user2: No doubt.  That seems to be a major theme in this movie and the sequels.
user1: So, it seems like Toy Story is always on TV, every 3 weeks or so, you can catch it
user2: And I typically end up watching it.  My son loves the movie.
user2: I am interested in where they will take the future sequels.
user1: yes, I agree. that will be interesting.
user1: I wonder how far they'll go? Toy Story 15??
user2: Ha.  I hope not.  I hope the introduce more toys from around the late 80's and 90's
user1: yes, that would be fun to see. My toys were in the late 60's early 70's
user2: Plenty of options.
user2: I forgot about the Sid character.
user2: I think we all knew a friend that was like him growing up.
user1: oh yea, I think we all grew up with a Sid, right?
user2: I had a little Sid in me too.  Wasn't always the most gentle with my toys
user1: If someone didn't, maybe there "the Sid" !

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: What movie did you just finish watching?
user1: Hello! Toy Story! Have you seen it?
user2: Yes I just did
user2: Did you like Buzz or Woody the best?
user1: I like Woody the best, because of Tom Hanks voice. How about you?
user2: I like Buzz because of how great he thinks he is
user2: i think it is funny when the toys act like they are not real when people are around
user2: Mr potato head is hilarious as well
user1: Oh yes and Don Rickles voice suits him!
user2: i agree
user2: It is nice that they both belong to the same boy and end up friends
user1: Yes, a great children's film
user2: The music by randy Newman is superb as well
user1: I completely agree!
user2: I cant believe it was 1995 when the movie was made
user1: I know, unreal! And Pixar's first produced movie!
user2: computer animation is what makes it great
user2: like real life
user1: Exactly! Did you like Rex or Slinky?
user2: rex
user1: Me too. I like how hes a little nervous all the time!
user2: Woody's pull string adds humor to the movie i think
user2: it looks like it received a very good rating
user1: Yes 100% from rotten tomatoes. Do you always watch movies rated 100%?
user2: sometimes. i think it was mean that woody tries to throw buzz behind the desk
user2: so he will get left behind
user1: It is mean. But Buzz did think he was a real space ranger and that was funny too
user2: The army men just make the movie 
user1: Oh yes, their use of baby monitors!
user2: i was just about to say that
user2: a remote controlled car wAS THE perfect get away car lol
user2: I bet the toys felt bad when they realized that Woody was really a good guy
user1: Yeah! They really get people to understand what toys are about, dont they?
user2: At least the remote controlled car got saved at the last minute too
user2: yes it is like they have a life of their own
user1: Yeah it was cool that buzz and woody werent rivals later on, but friends
user2: yep and Andy never knew a thing
user1: nope, who knew a move to a new house be so exciting!
user2: i bet they were scared of that puppy when it arrived
user2: now buzz and woody both have something to be afraid of
user2: Sid and Scud sound scary
user1: yes they do 
user1: i wouldnt want them as neighbours!
user2: true
user2: pizza planet sounds fun
user2: the toys must have been scared in sids house
user1: yes and the delivery truck ride too
user1: yeah stuck in that crane game
user1: How old was Andy again?
user2: six i think
user1: Ah yes thats right!
user2: i wonder if molly new the toys came alive
user1: I don't think so...maybe they'll be another movie
user2: i hope so
user2: bo peep must have been cute as a shepherdess
user1: Me too. Razzle dazzle technique with this movie!
user1: yeah, and funny Hamm piggy bank
user2: he really is hammin it up in the movie it sounds like lol
user1: yeah haha i thought it was a very funyn movie

conversation:
user1: Hi!  How are you doing tonight?
user2: great u?
user1: Pretty good...wish there was something good on t.v.
user2: toy story is a great movie. It was my favorite as a child. 
user1: That'd be great if it was on!  How many Toy Story movies are there, anyway?
user2: I believe there are 5 movies now
user1: I think I've only seen 3 of them, then. I liked them all!
user2: Yes.. did you know tom hanks was the voice of woody and tim allen was buzz?
user1: I did know that!  There were some other famous "voices" in them too, I think.
user2: yes. don rickles was mr potato head, jim varney was the slinky dog, and wallace shawn was rex. At least those were the famous actors in the 1st movie
user1: Wallace Shawn...that name I don't know.  What else has he done?
user2: I do not know, but the movie was also executive-produced by steve jobs.
user1: That's part of the fun of watching TS...figuring out the different voices!
user2: Yes. It is a very imaginative movie. That is appealing to both kids and adults.
user1: I don't think there's a Pixar movie I don't like.
user2: Me too. My favorite character is mr. Potato head.
user1: Mine is Jessie from TS2.
user1: ...and the little shorts they do before the movie are as good as the movie!
user2: Yep I agree! my favorite scene in toy story is when they go to the space arcade and get stuck in the crane game.
user1: The little green army men are pretty hilarious, too.
user1: There's so much of the movie I like, but I've forgotten alot of the little details.  Makes me want to go watch it again.
user1: Is there any good music in the TS movies?
user1: Hello?  Still there??

conversation:
user1: What did you think of the moving Toy Story?
user2: Well that depends. Which toy story movie?  
user1: The first Toy Story?  It came out in 1995. 
user2: It was fun! especially watching it as a kid and then wondering what my toys would do. 
user2: What about you? Have you seen it?
user1: I have seen it. I really enjoyed it too.  When I re-watched it as an adult, I was surprised to find out how famous the voice-over actors are!
user2: I'm trying to figure out if I should watch it again, but it might be a bit dated and not have the same feel. What did you think when you re-watched it?
user2: I find it really fun to try to identify voice actors :) 
user1: I don't think the themes are dated.  Animation has definitely improved since the mid-90's but I tend to agree with critics that the themes this movie touches on are universal and timeless.
user1: I think that you would find new humor as an adult in many of the jokes. 
user2: Ya I think that is true. The whole idea of "rejecting the outsider" and "not wanting change" and then become ok with it and enjoying it, in the end, seems like something we all could be reminded of. 
user2: Haha ya that's always fun. Antz is a really good movie for finding those jokes too. 
user1: Even today, Toy Story has a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes so it has withstood the test of time.
user2: Wow, rotten tomatoes is harsh too so that's impressive. 
user1: I know! Those reviews are brutal.  Did you know that Toy Story was the first feature-length computer animated film?  
user2: No actually. That's pretty neat. Oddly makes sense? Though I probably would have guessed fantasia if asked. but maybe that's not considered a "film" 
user2: Though other animated movies are good, and I do enjoy them. They don't really make you think as much as toy story does. Which feels odd to say
user1: Toy Story is actually the first feature length film Pixar ever did.  
user2: Well they did a great job, and still do. 
user1: I think everyone can relate to the fear of change; just like the toys do while Buzz impresses them with his various features.  
user1: Revenge, jealously, friendship, and humor are all present. 
user2: Very true. kinda the base emotions of kids in some ways. which makes it even more relatable
user1: When you watch the movie, take note of the Pizza Planet scene.  
user2: Ya it's a good scene. Is there somthing special about it?
user1: It is really the turning point in the story.  Woody and Buzz begin to fight and that is why they end up being forgotten by Andy.  From that point on, they are forced to work together to get way from the mischievous neighbor, Sid. 
user2: Ah, very true. By working together they come to know eachother instead of judge eachother for what they think they know about the other. 
user1: Exactly - Buzz ends up saving Woody at his own expense.  Buzz gets left behind and Woody has to save him.
user2: Ya, cause you can't just leave the guy behind who saved you. Especially not in a kids movie.
user1: Exactly! The two toys bond and eventually even joke about what it will be like when they get the "new arrivals"
user2: Ya they learn and grow, as we all should when faced with new experiences. 
user2: Even Sid changes a bit. 
user1: Exactly.  The movie ends comically when they find out Andy is getting a puppy next year,

user2: Sorry, for m'y mistakes
user1: That's fine. Pretty old movie, though.

user1: Does the movie seem slow paced to you?
user2: What does that mean slow paced?
user1: I mean, does the movie's plot take time to get going.
user2: Nooo I dont think so, 
user1: Oh, Ok.

conversation:
user1: Hi! One of my favorite Pixar movies is Toy Story.
user2: I love Pixar movies
user1: Yes! It is a great movie because it has Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. 
user1: Many critics say Tom Hanks brings invaluable talent and believability to the character that he voices, Woody. 
user2: That seems very interesting
user1: The movie definitely got me thinking about what my toys were up to when I wasn't home.
user1: This movie got a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 9/10 for most other critic scores. 
user2: Lol.  It would seem that you still have an active imagination
user1: With a score like that, everyone should go and see the movie!
user2: Yes, it would seem so
user2: Didn't Steve Jobs start Pixar?
user1: The movie came out in 1995 but it's presence is strongly felt to this day
user1: I am not sure about that but did you know that a six year old was the one who owned al of the toys?
user2: Wasn't there a sequel?
user1: Andy, the boy's, birthday party was moved up and there was a mess! The toys quickly came together to find out what andy got for his birthday.
user2: Then what happened after?
user1: They thought they wouldn't be replaced by another toy til Buzz Lightyear came out of the box.
user2: That is the astronaut?
user1: Yes!
user2: Ok.  They named him after an actual astronaut
user1: All the other toys are amazed at what Buzz does, including Andy, and Woody gets sad
user1: Out of jealousy, Woody tries to trap Buzz and hide him forever!
user2: Even toys get jealous.  Imagine that.
user1: Plans don't turn out the way they think though and suddenly they are captured by the evil next door neighbour
user2: Yes, the evil child is very important for moving along the story.
user1: Of course! They have to be captured THE DAY the family is moving!
user2: What happens next
user1: Then, they are in the evil kid's house and the dog finds the toys, Scud.
user2: Is that a potato?
user1: The toys quickly plot and escape Scud and the toys are somehow able to get Buzz's rocket working and they shoot off.
user1: Scud is the dog.
user1: The toys hope to get there in order to be safe with Andy
user2: Ok, I figure that out. How does the story continue?
user1: You'll have to watch it to find out!

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: hey
user1: I feel old discussing this movie because I was 10 when it came out, have you seen Toy Story?
user2: I have I was 12 when it came out. 
user2: I still watch this movie today when it comes on. one of my favorite Disney Pixar movies actually.   
user2: have you watched other movies by Disney Pixar?
user1: I have
user1: Like, most of them
user1: Not surprised it got a real high rating from rotten tomatoes.
user1: Has a good story and I thikn it was the first fully animated movie made.
user2: Me either. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were great choices as voice-overs in this movie so I'm not surprised by the critics response either. 
user1: I Didnt realize that Don Rickels voices Potato Head!
user1: and Jim Varney was instantly recognizable as the slinky dog
user2: I didn't either until I read this document!  
user2: John Lessetter is the same director of some of the other Disney Pixar movies I believe, isn't he?
user1: I think several
user1: I was also just young enough to still play with toys like the movie shows, so it was really relatable at the time
user1: and now I have two young kids, so its funny to them too
user2: My daughter still has a Jesse doll from this movie... 
user2: music by Randy Newman.. the music was a perfect fit for this movie.. you got a friend in me, was a song that sticks with me from this movie.. 
user1: Oh yea, definitely.
user2: haha -- I freaked out when I was a kid and Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out of the window.
user1: Hah yep. They made genuinely attachable characters. My brother actually went to halloween as buzz lightyear recently. They stick to you
user2: they do, Buzz Lightyear was popular... even the aliens at the Pizza Planet became a hot item
user2: oh Sid Phillips. the neighbor kid... he was a wild one
user1: Sorry, got busy there
user2: no problem... 
user1: Reminds me of my neighbor kids in some ways
user1: I honestly thnk most toys are like Buzz now. Lots of lights and flash
user2: oh of course... back then, all kids wanted a buzz because of his features
user2: my little brother would scream if you touched his Buzz
user2: even RC ran on batteries, heck, they're chargeable now LOL
user1: Exactly!
user1: "How do you turn it on?"
user1: Admittedly i'm a total millenial.. anyway.
user1: I love that Sid named his dog after a missle.. SCUD
user2: Yes!!! 
user2: I was scared when baby was walking around with no head and a popped out eye
user2: Sid was a great character tho!
user1: m
user2: he played the role of the kid who wasn't nice to his toys nor took care of them... seemed that way any way
user1: woops, me too! He even had the skull tshirt
user2: living toys, who would've thought a movie would go so big

conversation:
user1: Toy story is a great movie!
user2: Great movie

conversation:
user2: Hey, what did you think of that movie, Toy STory?
user1: It was great, I loved the relationships between the toys
user2: I truly enjoyed the bonds that the toys had as well! I feel like the voice actors such as Tom Hanks and Tim Allen really made the characters come to life. 
user1: Definitely, Tom Hanks really brought value to Woody's character
user1: Each toy is true to their own character
user2: That, they are! As the first computer animated film, Toy Story is such a masterpiece due to the amount of detail that is put into it. 
user1: Yes, and the best part is the toys don't live as if they are toys. They see themselves as bigger than they are.
user1: its brilliant
user2: Not only that but they teach the viewers the value of perception vs. reality. For example, when Buzz Lightyear discovered he was but a toy. There are so many lessons within this story that young children can take away from this movie.
user1: I agree. I like how Buzz and Woody began as rivals for Andy's affection, then wwhen times got tough, they worked together to reunite with him.
user1: Mr Potato head is a great character, too.
user2: He for sure was but my favorite toy was probably Rex just because he was so anxious like i always am.
user1: Some other good toys are Bo Peep and Hamm the Piggy Bank. They work with Buzz and Woody throughout the film, like at Andy's party.
user2: It's great to have non-focal characters who are just as significant in a story.
user2: I really liked how the creators made the toys lifeless and brought them to life. As a kid, I always felt like my toys were alive when i was away so that was great to see on the screen.
user1: And who would think that little green army men could carry baby monitors and serve as lookout?? Very cool.
user2: Everything about the movie was pretty cool! 
user2: Otherwise it would fail to average a 9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Well, it was directed by John Lasseter. He is a talented director.
user2: I loved how from the very beginning, Woody and Buzz's feud was shown. It made their moments of bonding even better.
user1: Yes, I think the feud originated from Woody's jealousy of Buzz once he arrives and starts receiving Andy's attention. 
user2: What got to me was how Woody was so caught up in making life hard for Buzz that Buzz had maneuver his way around Woody which alone caused him to get stuck in the crane machine.
user1: That also occured because Buzz still believed he was a space ranger
user2: Which he soon found out was not the case.
user2: These toys brought awareness to the idea of self-realization. had he known who he was, he never would have made that attempt.
user1: true, and they were all brought together by their mutual love for Andy
user2: Yes!
user2: At the end of the day, Andy loved them all for the uniqueness each toy bestowed,
user1: I like the part where Buzz tries to save Woody from Scud 
user1: But it was unfortunate that it caused Buzz to be left behind
user2: But they are eventually able to get themselves out of the that sticky situation. Together as a team
user1: But Woody shouldn't have asked so soon what might be worse than Buzz because now both of them have to deal with a puppy.
user2: At least it was something that Buzz ans Andy could bond over.

conversation:
user2: Hello 
user1: Hi, the movie I have is Toy Story. Have you ever watched Toy Story?
user2: No, I haven't! I've always wanted to see it, though - just never got around to it
user2: Is it any good?
user2: I'm assuming it's about toys - but not sure what it's actually about. Could you tell me?
user1: It's pretty much a buddy comedy. 
user2: Who are the buddies?
user2: Are they toys?:-) 
user1: A cowboy named Woody and an astronaut named Buzz! I know it sounds wacky, but that's the kind of thing your in store for with this movies.
user1: They are indeed toys. 
user1: Plus they have an amazing cast behind the toys. 
user2: Who plays Woody and Buzz?
user2: Love the astronaut's name, by the way
user1: Right. Super clever. So Tim Hanks plays Woody and Tim Allen plays buzz. 
user2: I love Tom Hanks!
user2: Who else is in it?
user2: Are all the characters toys?
user1: Tom Hanks is the best. 
user1: And no, not all the characters are toys
user1: The plot pretty much revolves around Buzz and Woody trying to win the affection of their ownder. 
user2: So what's going on in it? What do Woody and Buzz do?
user2: Oh, that's kind of sad and adorable!
user2: Is the owner still a kid?
user1: The owner is still a kid. 
user1: and whenever he walks into the room
user1: the toys stop moving 
user2: Haha! 
user2: So they are aware they're toys, right?
user2: Is it just the two of them?
user2: I should probably watch the movie, though, instead of asking you about every detail of it :-) 
user1: No there are a whole cast of toys: Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank and Slinky dog
user1: and they are all toys
user1: You should
user1: it's got a 100 percent on rotten tomatoes
user1: and a 95/100 on metacritic
user2: I used to collect piggy banks as a child, so I'm guessing Hamm the Piggy Bank will be my favorite one :-) 
user2: Oh, wow, that's a really good score! 
user1: Yeah, and on top of that, the movie looks amazing!
user2: And it's perfect to watch with my 6 year old nephew, I assume?
user1: You would never guess what year it came out
user1: and it is the perfect movie to watch with your six year old
user2: I know there was a Toy Story 3, so I am guessing around 2010-2012 or something?
user1: Nope 
user2: I should have seen this movie by now
user1: try 1995! 
user2: Earlier?
user2: NO WAY!
user1: Yes way! 
user2: Wait, there's no way Toy Story is that old
user2: Are you trying to say I myself was a kid when it came out?! (11 years old in 1995)
user1: It's hard to believe, but Toy Story was revolutionary at the time! 
user1: I am saying that
user2: Wow, I really thouhgt it was much much newer movie
user2: I HAVE to see it! 
user1: You have to! 
user1: and even though its a kids movie
user1: it's hilarious 
user2: Inviting my nephew over for a movie night this coming weekend :-) 
user1: Pixar does a great job of making movies for all ages
user2: Oh, I love both animated movies and especially Pixar's movies - so I don't  doubt that at all
user1: That's the spirit! 
user2: Would you happen to know who the director of the movie is?
user1: It's John Lasseter, but you should just watch the movie for yourself. 
user1: !
user2: I definitely will! Here's a thank you in advance from both me and my nephwe

conversation:
user2: What movie are we talking about?
user1: toy story
user1: have you seen it 
user2: I haven't seen it but I've heard so much I kind of feel like I did.
user2: Wasn't Tom Hanks in it?
user1: did you know that it was the first feature length animated film made by pixar
user1: yes he is 
user2: I didn't know that about Pixar.
user1: tom allen is in  it as well
user2: Tom Allen? I thought it was Tim Allen from Home Improvement.
user1: my mistake yes tim allen
user2: Did it win any awards?
user1: even though it is a cartoon movie for kids it has some pretty decent humor scenes in it
user2: Yeah, they have to make kids movies that adults like too.
user1: im pretty sure they did not sure on which awards though
user2: I guess it made tons of money.
user1: my favorite character is mr. potatoe head
user1: it sure has
user2: Do you know who the voice of Mr. Potato Head was?
user1: don rickles
user2: Oh yeah. Don Rickles is great.
user2: Did you see any of the sequels?
user1: yes i own all of them
user2: Was the original the best one?
user1: to me i like toy story 3
user2: Does it help a lot to watch the original one first or not?
user1: not really 
user2: I'll probably try to find it on demand and start from the beginning anyway.
user1: cool it will be worth the watch
user2: I'll probably end up watching all of them.
user1: do you have kids 

conversation:
user1: HI WHAT MOVIE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ?
user2: Toy Story
user1: HI FUN !
user1: NEVER SAW THAT ONE .. WHATS IT ABOUT ?
user2: It's about a toy named Woody. 
user2: The movie is about Woody and another toy named Buzz Lightyear. They're owned by a kid named Andy and go missing when Andy moves to a new house. 
user2: You should check it out, it has a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: OH THAT MOVIE SOUNDS INTERESTING
user1: OH THATS A GOOD SCORE 
user1: PEOPLE MUST LIKE IT 
user2: Yeah, some critics have said it's one of the best voiced animated features in memory. 
user2: Also, Steve Jobs was a producer, so that's pretty cool. 
user1: HOW INTERESTING .
user2: It's really funny too. 
user1: I LIKE FUNNY MOVIES ,, IS IT A FAMILY TYPE MOVIE ?
user2: Buzz Lightyear thinks he's actually a space ranger and is very serious about his job. 
user2: Yeah, it would be great to watch with kids. 
user1: OH CUTE I THINK I HAVE SEEN THAT TOY BEFORE 
user2: Yeah you can buy all the toys in stores now. Woody is a pull-string cowboy doll. 
user2: Did you know that Tom Hanks did the voice for Woody? 
user1: OH TOM HANKS IS A GREAT ACTOR HE HASNT BEEN IN MUCH LATELT
user1: LATELY 
user2: No, but I heard he's going to play Mr. Rogers in a new biopic. So glad he'll be back on the big screen soon!
user1: HE IS VERY FUNNY 
user1: OH FUN HE DOES KIND OF REMIND ME OF MR RODGERS
user2: So funny. I love him.
user1: THATS GOOD HE IS DOING MORE STUFF AGAIN 
user1: IS THE MOVIE A REALLY LONG MOVIE
user2: Yeah, anyway, getting back to Toy Story, his voice acting skills bring a lot of emotion to the story.
user2: No, it's an average length movie. 
user1: HE HAS A GOOD VOICE FOR CHARACTER ANIMATION
user1: OH GOOD I DONT LIKE TO WATCH TV FOR TOO LONG I LIKE BEING OUTSIDE MORE 
user2: Yeah, Woody tries to convince Buzz he's not a real space ranger, and it's a great scene. 
user1: IT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN ADVENTURE
user2: Yeah, there's another funny scene where they try to prepare for all the new toy arrival on Christmas day. Their owner ends up getting a puppy, which makes them a little nervous. 
user1: THANKS 

conversation:
user1: HELLO
user2: hello

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello
user2: I am interested in watching a movie
user1: how about Toy Story?
user2: sure, anything interesting about it?
user1: It's an animated movie starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen
user2: Is it an old movie?
user1: From 1997, so sort of
user2: wow
user1: 1995*
user2: 23 years ago!
user2: I feel old now
user1: Yeah, I know
user1: Apparently it has a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score
user2: Do you know how long the movie is?
user1: I don't but I think it's around 90-100 minutes
user2: I probably need to just buy the digital version, I lost the original a long time ago
user1: It's a good movie to have in a collection, I think
user2: A perfect score, wow, bet not many movies could say that
user2: Many movies that come out today seem like fails
user2: It can be a great family movie
user1: I think that Pixar often succeeds in these things by bringing in very nuanced emotions, like the fear of being replaced as someone's most loved person (or toy in this case)
user2: It has been so long since I watched it, I don't remember the storey line
user1: Andy, the little boy, gets a new Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen and Woody, the cowboy toy played by Tom Hanks, is jealous because he's Andy's favorite toy
user2: Oh, I love Time Allen and Tom Hanks, both great voices.
user1: Yeah, and the movie also features Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn who have very unique voices
user2: Who does Don Rickles play?
user1: He's Mr. Potato Head
user2: I never knew that
user2: Thanks for all the info, learned something new today
user1: No problem!

user1: Hi

user2: Hi
user2: Have you ever seen Toy Story?
user1: No, but i love the other pixar movies
user1: what is it about?
user2: It's about talking toys
user1: cool
user1: thats like every kids dream
user2: Yes it is. It came out in 1995
user1: wow
user2: Do you like Tom Hanks?
user1: old movie
user1: yes
user1: i love tom hanks
user2: He's the lead character
user1: cool
user1: hes so charming
user2: Do you know Tim Allen?
user1: yea of course
user1: home improvement
user1: loved that show
user2: He plays Buzz Lightyear
user1: is Buzz lightyear one of the toys?
user2: Yes
user1: cool
user1: whats happening in the story
user2: It got 100 percent on rotten tomatoes
user1: well everything before they started aggregating for release don't really count
user1: like a ton of old movies have 100% on rotten tomatoes
user2: The story is about two toys getting lost and they have to find their way back to their owner named Andy
user1: sounds like a fun little adventure film
user1: like homeward bound
user1: but with toys
user2: It is
user2: John Lasseter directed it
user1: cool
user1: he made a few of the other pixar movies as well
user2: Yes. The Metacritic score was 95/100
user1: sounds like a fun one to watch
user1: i think ill have to check it out
user1: anything else you can tell me about it

conversation:
user2: Hey
user1: Hello!
user2: SO, have you ever seen Toy Story?
user1: Yes. I have. I think Pixar did an excellent job with the casting of this film.
user1: Even the supporting characters are fantastically cast.
user2: I think they did as well! I don't think I have ever seen a movie that had a 100% viewer rating!
user1: That's a very good point! I wonder if the rating is nostalgia based, or if people would have given it a 100% rating in 1995
user2: Yeah that is a good point actually about the nostalgia aspect!
user2: I actually can't believe that movie came out in 1995
user2: And Steve Jobs was the executive producer?!
user1: I had no idea! Also, I didn't know a Coen brother worked on the script!
user2: Wow, compared to some of the extremely dark stuff that the Coen brothers work on in general. I had no clue.
user2: So, do you have a favorite character in the movie?
user1: I am tied between Slinky Dog, portrayed by Jim Varney and Don Rickles' Mr. Potato Head.
user1: What about you?
user2: I already really like Bo Peep,or Slinky Dog, who is played by Jim Varney
user2: I love that they use baby monitors to communicate back and forth.
user1: Agreed! It made the dramatic scene of learning about the gifts at the birthday party much more heightened. Like old fashioned radio.
user1: Sid was terrifying on so many levels.
user2: Yes exactly! There are so many little references like that throughout the film, I love it.
user2: HAH! When I was a kid, Sid spooked me so much.
user2: I love that Buzz is all "high tech" which increases the likeness between him and the other toys.
user1: Exactly! That'
user1: s a great point
user1: And all of the other toys were so impressed by him
user2: I know, hahaha just because he could press a button and open his wings.
user2: I love the scene when they are at the pizza place as well
user1: But actually he served the same function as the other toys when it come down to it. Minus all the bells and whistles, he was still a regular toy, subject to the same insecurities
user1: Me too! The crane game was a great nostalgic throwback
user2: Oh yes definitely! There is a lot of undertones of bigger lessons throughout the film!
user2: Some of the toys that Sid created were incredibly disturbing too
user2: I think I remember that spider baby head thing
user1: The ending was great. So many lessons, but friendship was the ultimate one
user1: Also I forgot RC ran out of batteries. Such a real life trauma! ha ha
user2: It really is! That small little RC car in the road hahah.
user1: I think that was one of the best parts of the film. People could recognize so many of the toys and so many associated issues with them in their own lives (batteries, losing a toy, etc)
user1: Also the idea of getting new toys during the holidays, but then always going back to the toys you knew and loved no matter what.
user2: Oh that is right! The fear that they could possibly be replaced
user2: Is it in the first film when Andy grows up in the end?
user1: I'm not sure. I remember him getting the dog, and the other toes being worried about that, but I think the dog wouldn't replace the toys so much as maybe destroy them ha ha
user2: Oh yes the dog, I remember the dog from the other films too!
user2: I might actually watch this movie later on!
user1: That had to be terrifying from a toy's perspective, especially after dealing with Sid's dog earlier!
user1: It's such a classic film
user2: I know I would be spooked if I saw another dog after Sid's intense dog!
user1: And the damage that could be done to you!
user2: Alright I think we've hit the amount of lines. Have a good day!
user1: You too!

conversation:
user1: Hi! 
user2: Hi, how are you?
user1: Great, thanks. You? How was the movie? 
user2: Excellent, thanks for asking. It's Toy Story!
user1: What was it about? 
user1: I've never seen it and would love to know if I should sit down to watch it.
user2: Good! it is about the relationship between an old;fashinoned pullstring cowboy doll and an astronaut action figure. They are initially rivals competing for the affections of their owner but end up working together!
user1: Is it scary at all? What ages do you think it's appropriate for? 
user2: The information available doesn't tell me the age it is appropriate for, but it says itś a buddy comedy adventure film, so my best guess is , it would be a wonderful treat for the whole family!
user2: It also includes an astronaut action figure, so it might include some intense action scenes, but nothing really scary from what I know.
user1: Awesome, thanks. Do you know what the main conflict is or what the characters are trying to resolve? 
user2: There are at least two main topics in the movie: The first one, the conflict between Woody, the old-fashioned toy , and Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger arrived as a gift surprise, for the affections of their owner, six-year-old Andy Davis; and the second, Andy's family is moving, toys and everything, to a new home. The moving topic is prevalent through the whole movie, but in its first half it moves to the background to highlight the rivalry between Woody and Buzz; finally, when the rivalry is solved, they work together to be reunited with their owner.
user1: That sounds interesting. Does the boy, Andy, know that his toys are "alive" or have lives outside of the time he sees them? Is it part of his imagination or really happening? 
user2: toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present. There is no way to find out if Andy is aware of that.
user2: That might add up to the comedic factor!
user1: Oh! I see. Do you know how long the movie is? ... Oh, I'm assuming it is all a cartoon right? Or is it like the old 80's and 90's movies that mixed cartoons and regular film? 
user2: Toy Story was the first feature-lenght computer-animated film and the first feature fillm produced by Pixar, so it is definiitely not a short film. And it is computer-animated, moving one step beyond the cartoons. it does not appear to include "regular" scenes, it might be computer animation only.. Something really interesting to watch for the weekend, don't you think?
user1: I'm thinking about it. It sounds really interesting - but it is a cartoon. I'm wondering if the content matter is deep enough for an adult to walk away with something from it. What do you think? 
user1: I didn't realize it was the first Pixar film. THa
user1: That's pretty awesome. I think I've enjoyed other Pixar films and wonder if this one is similar.
user2: Good question. A film critic says the movie has the king of spring-loaded allusive prankisness that at time, will tickle adults even more than it does kids... so it seems all infants, youngsters and grown-ups are entitled for a big share of laughs and enjoyment. Nobody is likely to get bored, regardless the age.
user2: about other Pixar films, critics gave rave reviews to Toy Story, so when you succeed the first time you are more prone to repeat the formula. That is what I think.
user1: That's true. Are there any villains in  this film? I know you explained conflict between the cowboy and the astronaut - but are there "bad guys" in addition to these main characters?
user1: Also, since it is the first Pixar film - do you think the quality of animation is the same as later Pixar films? I just wonder if I've already "seen" it in a remake (the repeated formula) and will be bored or uninterested if I sit down to watch it.
user1: Ha, I guess I'm very hesitant to watch a cartoon and waste my time.
user1: And, at the same time, hesitant to expose my children to a film that may scare them or make them worried about their toys.
user1: Of course, you do make really good arguments though. If it's the first Pixar film, well reviewed, and also thought of as amusing to adults - I may be over thinking it. Have you watched it? What would you rate it?
user2: In first instance Woody and Buzz seem to be "the bad guy" to each other. Then upon making peace everyone focuses on the moving...What's in store for the gang then? I think it's definitely worth a look to find out!
user2: about the scary stuff.. w
user2: Well, there is a mischivieous neighbor with a chasing dog.. that might be upsetting a little bit , I think
user2: I am getting to know the fillm from this review, and i'm dying to rent it to watch it asap.
user1: Yeah, that could definitely be scary. - ... Didn't they make other toy stories? 
user1: I'm pretty sure I've heard they have-... that's usually a good sign for the first movie at least! 
user1: I think I'll watch it soon.
user1: Probably this weekend -... maybe screen it first and then sit with the kids if it's appropriate. Thank you so much for all your help. 
user2: Good! Hope you enjoy it. And I will have to find out if there have been any other sequels. Being this movie from 1995, it is quite likely.
user2: And thanks for your conversation! It's been a pleasure
user1: Yes, it's been great! Do we press abort conversation? My side does not say finish? 

conversation:
user1: Toy Story is a classic American movie that came out in 1995.
user2: Such a great movie.  I loved the interaction between Woody and Buzz.
user2: And the music by Randy Newman was perfect.
user1: Tim Allen played Buzz and Tom Hanks played Woody. Top notch voice acting.
user2: Yes, absolutely.  They were both wonderful.
user1: My favorite side character was Mr. Potato Head played by Don Rickles
user2: Yes he was hilarious.  There were so many great characters - I loved the T-rex as well.
user1: Me too, the T rex was great.
user1: Im glad you mentioned Randy Newman. "Thank you for being a friend" is a song I still love.
user2: Great song!
user1: Im not surprised the Rotten Tomatoes score was 100%, do you think it deserved that?
user2: Definitely, although it's rare to find a movie EVERYONE likes.
user2: But yes, I think it's absolutely deserving of all the good reviews it got.
user1: I agree, its definitely a whole family type of move, and those of quality are hard to find.
user1: My favorite review I read stated "... razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look"
user2: It's hard to remember back that far but I think it was a big deal when it came out because the graphics and textures were so good.
user1: Right. It seemed to hold up animation wise. Although it might look even better if they reanimated it with todays tech.
user2: Key Scene #2 is one of my favorites - I still remember them playing the claw game and the little aliens saying "he is chosen!"
user1: That was the best! Me and my friends were talking about that scene the entire week afterwards. Those aliens were so cute!
user2: they were adorable!
user1: I always felt bad for Buzz that he thought he was real. Talk about an existential crisis.
user2: Me too...
user1: How did you feel about Sid and his dog Scud? They creeped me out.
user2: I don't think I remember the dog but didn't Sid have braces or headgear or something?  Or was that from another movie
user1: I think he had braces. And those really messed up toys he played with.
user2: oh that's right...
user2: I think this last scene was less memorable than the others...  The best part of this movie was the setup and all the character development.  Almost didn't matter how it ended.
user1: I definitely agree with you, although I don't want to. When I think back to the movie, I hardly remember that scene.
user2: Yeah, absolutely.  Although it's been several years since I've seen it.
user2: Still an amazing movie - really 3 amazing movies with wonderful voice acting and music.
user1: Me too, but its one of those movies that stays with you all these years later.

conversation:
user1: Hey there, how'd you like Toy Story?
user2: Toy Story was a cute movie.  It is a great lesson for kids to learn, how to be loyal to friends.
user1: It really was a cute movie.  I didn't know that Joss Whedon was involved in the screenplay, did you?
user2: No I never really paid attention to the credits.  I think Tom Hanks and  Tim Allen always were forefront, and noticed more.
user1: That's true, but there were so many other voice actors there too!  I think that's why I really liked it, due to the ensemble cast.  Who will ever forget Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head?  
user2: I always liked Slinky, but as in so many cases, the better know get the credit, and the ones that have stellar performances,, get overlooked.
user1: And who can forget the look at Buzz's face when he realized he was actually a toy?  Kind of a heart-breaking moment, I think.
user2: Woody when he realized he had been forgetten...
user1: Very true.  Did you think about your own childhood toys, when you were watching the movie?
user2: Unlike the boy in the movie I still have some of my original toys put up for my kids.
user1: That's great.  I'm sure they'll enjoy sharing those memories with you someday.  Do you watch a lot of Pixar or other animated films?
user2: Not really, its hard to believe that Toy Story was from 1995, it doesnt seem like it was that long ago
user1: It really was.  In fact, it was Pixar's first animated full-length feature film.
user2: Pixar, in my opinion, was such a step up from regular animation.
user1: It really raised the bar with the current edge techniques and use of computer animation.  
user2: I liked all the pranks and antics of the toys, it gave them real personality
user1: Speaking of antics, do you remember the scene when Andy and his family are heading to Pizza Planet and his mother will only let him bring one toy?
user2: Yes, its so hard to choose amongst your friends.  But watching Buzz and Woody go from enemies to friends,, is such a great evolution to watch.  Its also a great lesson for kids, and grown ups
user1: True, true.  And of course the Pizza Planet scene lead to the unforgettable introduction of the "Crane".
user2: Nice, it has some of the best voiced animation of all movies
user1: It really does.  It made me a fan of Tim Allen actually.  I think he was perfectly cast as Buzz Lightyear.
user2: Tom Hanks can read a phone book and make it work, but he had great moments in this movie
user1: Agreed.  And speaking of great moments, how about Andy's new Christmas puppy at the end of the movie?
user2: I would be worried too, between being chewed on, and being ignored, tough situation
user1: Definitely.  Nothing like having a shared enemy to really seal a friendship, eh?
user2: Ha, true.  I had forgotten about the dog Scud, what a great bad guy!
user1: So many great scenes in that movie!  
user2: Yes, what a great correlation between actors and characters.
user1: They really brought the characters to life, that's for sure.
user2: Made it a classic for future movies, to measure against.
user1: Agreed.  And really established Pixar as a world-class producer of animated films!
user2: It should habve been a 10 out of 10
user1: Well, Rotten Tomatoes did give it a 100% and viewers gave it an average of 9/10.
user1: Those are really high ratings.  Pretty much a universally loved film.
user2: Rotten Tomatoes does have a great reputation for reviews
user1: And Metacritic scored it a 95 out of 100!
user2: it does have great ratings

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user1: Have you seen Toy Story? You should. It got 100 on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: no, not intrested
user2: is that movie good
user1: Do you have kids? They love this movie. My kids, when they were younger would watch the whole movie and then ask to watch it again when it was done.
user1: It's a really good movie. Very funny for kids and for adults. Tom Hanks plays the main character.
user2: Oh!! you mean this movie is good for kids, is it like animation kind of movie
user1: Yes, it's an animation movie.
user2: Ok,.. will it be fun to watch for 2 yrs kids?
user1: Oh, yes. My kids were little when they watched it. It's great for toddlers.
user2: who is the director?
user1: I'm not sure who directed the movie.
user2: ok...what exactly the story..
user1: Oh wait, John Lasseter directed it. The story is about a group of toys that belong to a boy named Andy. When he leaves the room, they all come to life.
user1: Will you watch the movie?
user2: it sounds great....so toys will be communicating...
user1: Yes, they do communicate.
user2: ok..
user1: Andy's toys get worried when he has a birthday party, because they are worried they will get replaced by the new toys.
user2: based on the details you provided about the movie is bit interesting... 
user1: It will be humorous to adults, even more than it does to kids.
user2: oh...okey
user2: obviously toys will be replaced with new toys after the birthday parties...is the samething happend in this movie...
user1: It was made in 1995, but is a classic movie.
user1: Yes, that's exactly what happens and the older toys get jealous.
user2: now a days toys are becoming friends to kids, even they will carry with them to shopping, parties and other places... is samething shown in this movie?
user2: any problem?...
user2: thr?

conversation:
user2: Have you ever seen Toy Story?
user1: Yes, I saw it many years ago. Have you seen it?
user2: Yes! For the longest time I did not know Tom Hanks played Woody.
user1: He was pretty good in that role.
user2: I also did not know Tim Allen played Buzz Lightyear. It is funny  the things you notice as an adult.
user1: I saw it when I was already an adult. I took my nephew to see it when he was 5 years old.
user2: That is awesome! The movie reviews and critical responses were all mostly very positive so I am sure it was enjoyable for both you and your nephew.
user2: Rotten Tomatoes scored it a 100%!
user1: Yes! I know we enjoyed it in different ways. For me, seeing some of the toys I played with as a child - Slinky Dog, and Mr. Potato Head - made it more enjoyable. 
user2: Would you classify the film as a comedy?
user1: Comedy-Adventure? I think that some of the jokes were clearly aimed at adults. 
user2: I would have to agree. Many of the green army guys' jokes were aimed towards the adult audience. I found it interesting that Buzz thought he was real while the rest of the toys knew they were not.
user1: I was thinking about Mr. Potato Head's reaction to Barbie!
user1: He kept saying, "I'm a married spud!"
user2: I also had a Mr. Potato head growing up so it was funny to watch him interact with the other toys.
user1: I think his movie personality was accurate. 
user2: I thought it was clever how all the toys spied on Andy's party with the baby monitors. 
user2: Do you remember the Pizza Planet scenes?
user1: Yes, when Andy took Woody with him instead of Buzz. 
user2: I thought it was hysterical when Buzz got trapped in the toy crane game with all the little green aliens. 
user1: Yes! I really liked the animation and the way the scenes were from different perspectives. 
user2: I believe this is the time when SId comes into the movie. I remember I had a neighbor who looked just like him lol.
user1: I think all of us knew a rotten kid like Sid!
user1: It is a little disturbing, though...Sid knows that the toys are alive, but tortures them anyway.
user2: I remember when Andy got a puppy for Christmas and all the toys were freaking out!
user1: Yes, for Woody and Buzz, it was like, "Here we go again!"
user2: That dog was way nicer than Sid's dog, Scud.
user2: At least it was a bonding moment for them.
user2: They had a mutual "enemy".
user1: Scud looked like a cross between the Target dog and a pit bull!
user1: Thanks for the convo!

conversation:
user2: This one is bound to be loved for years to come.
user1: Yes, it is a total classic and Rotten Tomatoes shows that with their 100% score! 
user1: Do you agree with that rating?
user2: I know, I didn't think anything could rate that high but Pixar really delivered
user2: I totally agree, instant classic.
user1: What do you think of the character Mr. Potato Head?
user2: Lol he was pretty funny. I also find it interesting that the toy that was designed to be a ferocious monster(the T-Rex) is actually not scary at all.
user2: I never knew that Joss Whedon and Steve Jobs were involved in the film.
user1: Yes! nervous TRex is such an oxymoron! 
user1: John Lassester really knew what he was doing with these characters as the director of the film. 
user2: Lol aye, good computer graphics and even a good script can't help without a good pilot at the wheel.
user2: It was amusing that the army toys acted like they were in the army.
user2: And Buzz Lightyear thinks he's a space explorer.
user2: They all seem to adapt to their understanding of their world in different ways, some become cynics while other retain their bright optimism.
user1: I love that they utilized SLinky Dog like a slinky toy. Dashunds are so long and lanky that it was a perfect fit! 
user2: Lol agreed! Good character design.
user1: I like that Buzz and Woody were fighting for Andy's attention, it gave it a good story to see them working together eventually. 
user2: Yeah, a good message there. They may have seen each other as rivals for his affection, bu there was plenty of room for both of them.
user1: Toy Story truly is one of the best kid's films out there that Pixar has 
user2: And this was one of their first, wasn't it? A good first impression any way you slice it.
user1: The best part was when Buzz still kept acting like he was a space ranger. He really committed to his line of work! 
user2: Lol he was built for it.
user2: I think it also may be helpful if a family is moving and a child is worried about losing toys in the process.
user1: Did you know that Andy's last name was Davis?!
user2: I didn't realize he had a last name, but then he must.
user1: Yep! It was their first feature film that Pixar ever produced. 
user2: I wonder if Woody's rank as Sheriff made me more likely to be their leader or if being built that way just gave him the qualities to become their leader with time.
user1: And for being produced in 1995, thats a pretty big feat to have such graphics with a animated feature film! 
user2: Yeah, it really holds up well. I think it is partly due to everything being animated so there isn't that disconnect when cgi is placed next to live action.
user2: It is also funny that these toys who want his affection so much, see that Andy gets a puppy.
user2: I wonder if the new puppy will be able to see the actions of the toys, Sid's dog could.
user2: I think a major lesson in the film is also to not jump to conclusions. Woody was certain that Buzz was trouble and the other toys preemptively judge Woody's actions as well.
user2: You still there, buddy?
user2: I wouldn't want to jump to conclusions like the toys did, lol.
user2: Normally I don't care for Randy Newman's music, just not my jam, but it fit the mood of the movie well.
user2: That Sid, though.
user2: Straight from a nightmare, lol.
user2: I think most people would like the idea that their toys were sentient when they weren't around, it would explain how they sometimes aren't where a person thought they were left.
user2: Especially if the toys were so good-natured like in the film.
user2: Is the response to the test, part of the test? Like for the toys in the crane machine?
user2: Now I know how the toys that Andy stopped playing with felt like.

conversation:
user1: Well they did call the cops 
user2: HI THERE.
user2: WHO CALLED THE COPS?
user1: But remember because of the weather/holidays they couldn't get through. Lines done and so on! The mom finally gets to talk to the cop tword the end but she calls and trys through the movie 
user2: TOY STORY IS A CUTE ANIMATED FILM ABOUT A WOODEN PULL STRING COWBOY WHO CAME TO LIFE ALONG WITH SOME OF HIS TOY-BOX FRIENDS.  ANDY IS THE YOUNG BOY WHOSE TOYS THEY ARE.  
user1: Toy story is an amazing movie
user1: 2 very famous Actors do the voices as well.
user2: BUZZ LIGHTYEAR WAS WOODY'S SIDEKICK, A SPECIAL RANGER ACTION FIGURE AND WOODY'S RIVAL.  HIS VOICE WAS DONE BY TIM ALLEN.
user2: MY SCREEN SHOWS YOU LEFT THE CHAT, ARE YOU NOW BACK?

conversation:
user1: Can you believe it toy story was made in 1995?
user2: It seems like such a long time ago. I'm impressed that it received such good critic reviews right away.
user1: What do you think about the cast?
user2: The cast seems to be quite famous. One wouldn't think that the first computer animated film and the first feature film by Pixar would garner such talent. What do you think?
user1: Do you like Randy Newmans music in the movie?
user1: It is an all star cast
user2: I think the music really added to the impressive animation
user1: Would you give it a 9.5 or higher?
user2: I certainly would. And it seems that critics agree given it's impressive ratings.
user1: Did anyone win awards for their roles?
user2: I'm not sure
user1: What do you think about toys coming alive?

conversation:
user1: hello there
user2: hi
user1: so lets talk about Toy Story 
user2: what did you think of the movie?
user1: it was an absolute childhood favorite 
user1: how about you
user1: ?
user2: i love it!!!  it's perfect for kids with a great storyline for adults too
user1: it was ahead of its time in animation,and yes excellent for all ages
user2: AGREED!!!  
user2: i know they have made others, have you seen them?
user1: i did see toy story 2and played the toy story 3 game however i did not see the actual movie.
user2: it's well worth seeing
user2: who's your favorite character?
user1: its defiantly on my too do list 
user2: i highly recommend it.  
user1: that would have too  be buzz 
user2: I love him!!!  Mine is Woody
user1: ive always respected tim allen as an actor and tom hanks as well,buttt buzz was the man 
user2: It's amazing to see how many famous actors are now starring in animated films
user2: tom hanks is the man!!!
user1: the game for toy story 3 was a blast though its hard to find a E rated game that out does other titles 
user2: i didn't realize they had made it into a game too
user1: i jst remeber  watching toy story and being wowed at the talent of the pixar animations 
user2: I feel like this was the movie that put Pixar on the map
user1: yeah and quite often games made by screen plays are very  sub par in comparison to the movie 
user1: oh yeah with out a doubt 
user2: i can't say that I have ever played a game based on a movie
user1: there are still movies to this day that dont look as good 
user2: im sure it's like reading the book and then watching a movie
user1: i mean take terminator 2 absolutely ahead of its time 
user2: definitely, the technology and CGI knocked it out of the park
user1: yeah i read HANNIBAL watching the movie and was quite disappointed 
user1: after watching the movie
user2: that has happened to me more times than i'd like to say
user2: LOL
user1: there are just so many pinacle points in the book that would make the screenplay outstanding,that could easily be added in and they choose not too and its like why why why? lol 
user2: i hate when they screw up small details
user2: thanks for chatting!!!
user2: hope you have a great rest of the day
user1: however this movie did it right and it holds a place in my heart i wont lie LOL
user2: LOL me too!!!
user1: ya you as well ;0

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you doing today?
user1: hi i'm well and you?
user2: I'm good, thank you.
user1: so i really liked this movie
user2: It's one of my favorites, too
user2: Tom Hanks was perfect as Woody
user1: and tim allen as buzz
user1: i liked the evolution of their friendship from rivals
user2: Yeah they hated eachother at first but became great friends
user1: yes
user1: it also felt very fresh
user2: The whole movie has a great theme- Friendship is important
user1: not like the other disney movies
user2: I agree
user1: very important!
user2: Pixar makes some great movies
user1: so imaginative
user2: but this one is my favorite of them
user1: one of the other characters i really enjoyed was rex
user2: I love how whenever a human comes in the room  that all they toys "play dead"
user2: I loved Mr Potatoa head
user1: haha oh yes
user2: *potato
user2: Did you know he was played by Don Rickles?
user1: i feel like rex (when the movie started) was so nervous but he finally hit his stride and became more confident
user1: yes!
user1: mr potato head had the best and driest one liners
user1: too funny
user2: Rickles was perfect for it
user1: sid was so awful wasn't he
user2: Yeah, it's funny- they show him grown up as a garbage man in one of the sequels
user1: haha yes! serves him right
user1: for being so mean lol
user2: I loved when Buzz actually got to "fly"
user1: to infinity and beyond!
user2: It was nice talking to you

conversation:
user1: hi..my name is mike
user1: what's yours
user2: Hi I am Joe. I really enjoyed Tom Hanks in Toy Story.
user1: yea me too
user1: I think he is a great actor 
user2: Pixar did a really good job with the movie and the director, John Lasseter, captured each voice actor's personality well.
user2: What did you think about the reviews of the movie?
user1: I didn't see the movie in a while
user1: how did it go?
user1: I think it was fair and great 
user1: did you see part two
user2: It focused on the relationship between Woody, a oty cowboy played by Hanks and Buzz Lightyear, a toy astronaut played by Tim Allen
user1: yea,now I'm remember
user1: and the boy name was andy right?
user2: That is correct. 
user1: yes,I loved that movie and now that i have a kid,I watch it with him at times
user2: Does he think Slinky Dog is funny? He cracked me up
user2: The Rex character was also pretty funny.
user1: yea he was
user1: I like the slinky two
user1: too
user1: buzz thought he was real 
user2: This was a movie where I agreed with the Rotten Tomato ratings. Usually I think they are off base
user1: I don't know to much about rotten tomato
user2: I thought we were supposed to be discussing four movies but it doesn't seem to advance
user1: what about forest gump with tom hawks...what you think about that movie
user1: it was pretty good to me
user2: I liked him better in Toy Story. The cast in Toy Story just seemed to enjoy themselves more in the movie
user1: yea,that is true
user1: I don't mine watch toy story right now LOl
user2: I thought the part about Buzz thinking he was a real astronaut just added to the story
user1: yes and when he tried to fly was funny 
user2: And I was glad in the end when the present Andy was getting was a puppy and not a toy to replace the other toys. You can never go wrong with a puppy!
user2: I also thought the scene where they were trying to get to the pizza parlor by hitching a ride on the pizza delivery truck was really well done. 
user2: Did you think Scud was going to catch them during that scene?
user1: yea
user1: but you know movies 
user2: Did you think it was wrong of Buzz to brag about all his features to Andy to win his affection?
user1: no
user1: he was proud to be a buzz light year
user1: lol

conversation:
user2: This film has a very interesting plot. 
user2: I did not know it was produced by Steve Jobs either. 
user1: Yes, the idea of toys coming alive has never really been done before.
user1: Well it was directed by John Lasseter.
user2: And executive-produced by Steve Jobs
user1: I didn't know that either.
user1: Do you think the movie deserved the high praise it got?
user2: Yes, because the plot was unlike anything used before and it has claimed the interest of its viewers since it was made. 
user1: Fair enough. It just surprises me that an animated movie would be so acclaimed.
user2: I think it has to do with being the "first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced by Pixar"
user1: That does sound like it would lend some prestige to the movie.
user2: Firsts are not typically forgotten, but having seen the movie and grown up with it as a kid, I can honestly say that it has stuck with me through my childhood and into adulthood. It is a hard movie to forget for so many people so there has to be more to that I suppose. 
user1: That's true. What did you think of Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear?
user2: This movie also has a very well-developed plot line that keeps its viewers hooked and allows children to resonate with it because most kids have toys similar to the ones in this movie. 
user2: I can't imagine anybody else playing him
user1: I agree. Without him, the movie would not be the same
user1: Do you generally watch movies with ratings as high as this one?
user2: Not this high so I guess I am a little surprised that this movie got such a high rating. 
user2: I think this movie targets children and attempts to correct feelings of jealousy and anger they may have towards their friends and/or siblings
user1: I agree. The rivalry between Woody and Buzz is a major theme.
user1: The fact that they become best friends at the end gives a positive message to all those watching.
user2: Yes I agree. 
user1: I think the part where Buzz and Woody get stuck in a crane game is one of the best parts of the movie.
user2: Do you feel this movie has been continuously brought up again and again throughout your life?
user2: I think this scene says a lot about the teamwork theme that continuously uprises throughout the film
user1: Yes, I feel like there is a lot in this movie I can relate to.
user2: Especially as a kid, it would be very beneficial for them to grow up with a movie like this to help them interact with people around them better and with a more positive attitude
user1: Exactly. The friendship that Buzz and Woody form is a positive inspiration.
user2: Do you think it is not a good idea to portray Andy as a kid that continues to get new things and forget about the old things?
user1: I think kids are normally like that, so I see no problem portraying Andy like that.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi there!
user1: so how did you like the movie?
user2: So how did you like Toy Story?
user1: Its one of my favorite movies 
user2: Ha ha...I loved it.
user2: Mine, too. I can watch it over and over.
user1: who was your favorite character?
user2: I like Woody and Mr. Potato Head. How about you?
user1: I love sid the evil neighbor next door 
user2: I like him, too.
user2: It's too bad the toys are lifeless when Andy is around. 
user1: This movie makes me feel like a kid again
user2: Yes, I totally agree.
user1: yeah, he does not get to see that there awesome people even though they are toys they care about him
user2: Yes, it would be fun to see him interact with the toys and hide it from his parents. It's funny when the army men spy on the party .
user1: they are awesome characters 
user2: It's also funny when Buzz shows up and impresses everyone - except I wanted Woody to punch him at first. Then he grew on me.
user1: wow punch him? those are some intense feelings
user2: No, it's just a figure of speech. I really meant outdo him.
user2: Get the best of him, so to speak.
user1: Ive never heard anyone use that term as a figure of speech 
user1: punching someone is not a figure of speech
user2: Okay, sorry. Let's get back to the movie. 
user1: okay, I love my potato head
user1: mr
user2: Sid's dog, Scud is funny.
user2: Yes, Don Rickles was perfect for Mr. Potato Head. 
user1: hahahahaha my dog looks just like him
user2: Really, that's hilarious! And cute, too!
user1: yeah, I get really sad watching the movie
user1: disney movies always hit home
user2: Sad?
user2: Yes, I know what you mean.
user1: yeah they just make me want to be a kid again and that growing up sucks
user2: I love the part where Woody and Buzz stage a mission to prepare for the new toys.

user2: Yes how about the movie Toy Story it is a great fa ily fil
user2: Family film
user1: Toy Story sounds like a great movie! What is it about?
user2: You story is a movie about toys that come to life when no one is watching, it mostly deals with the interactions between two toys one a young boys old favorite and one a brand new toy gotten for his birthday. Both toys get jealous of the other and go on a journey to reunite with the boy.
user1: Is the movie animated?
user2: Yes the movie is animated using computer graphics.
user1: That seems very interesting!
user1: What is the movie rated?
user2: I don't know what it is rated.

user1: Is the movie a comedy?
user2: I think so too but I couldn't find that info.
user1: Do you know when the movie was created?
user1: Or what year it was released?

user2: You Story is a film from 1995

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello!  How's your day?
user2: good
user2: you?
user1: Great thanks  :)
user1: Looks like we'll be talking about Toy Story today.  Are you a fan of animated movies?
user2: love em
user2: great movie
user1: excellent!  This one is one of my favorites
user2: yeah
user2: classic
user1: I'm a big fan of Tim Allen anyway, and I love his character Buzz Lightyear in this movie
user2: yeah
user2: brilliant character
user1: Absolutely
user2: tom hanks too
user1: Oh yes, I love Tom Hanks and he did a fantastic job playing Woody
user2: great
user2: love the whole story too
user1: I also loved Sarge and the green army men, I laugh just thinking about them
user2: haha yes
user2: so many great jokes
user1: Yes there were...  I loved the scene where they were headed to Pizza Planet and Woody finds out that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car and they get into a huge fight
user2: good scene
user1: I laughed so hard when they got stuck in the crane game
user2: yes
user2: i love all the characters
user2: all those toys
user1: I know it...  I even loved seeing Mr. Potato Head   LOL  and the dinosaur too
user2: yeah
user2: all so funny and so memorable
user2: their personalities come through
user1: I felt bad for Woody when all the other toys were against him, it made me feel so bad for him...  it's amazing how you can empathize with characters who are animated, and not even animated people but animated toys
user2: very true
user2: brilliant film
user2: so ahead of its time.
user1: Yes it was... I was just going to say t he same thing, very far ahead of its time and started a whole new movement of animated films that even adults can enjoy
user2: true
user2: good insights
user1: yes
user2: just a very groundbreaking movie
user1: I got so involved with the characters in this movie, I was actually worried when they got to the new house and found out Andy was getting a puppy for christmas
user2: yes
user1: was worried about him ignoring the toys and making them feel bad, which sounds ridiculous... it's a testament to how well developed the characters were
user2: great talkin to ya
user1: you too!

conversation:
user1: Have you seen Toy Story?  I really love that it was as good as the critics say - if not better!
user2: I have seen it and I would agree with you! The rotten tomato score is great! What did you think of the plot?
user1: It was really good - I love how the toys were really themselves while giving that feeling of imagination that playing with toys gives :)
user2: Yes! It is so fun to watch the toys come back to life. It is interesting to know that it was the first film produced by Pixar.
user1: Wow I didn't realize that!  They had some good voice actors there too - Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are wonderful picks
user2: I really do think that Tom Hanks made Woody very believable! What did you think about the different charachters? 
user1: They're all really good - especially the scene where Buzz realizes he's "just" a toy - pretty eye-opening even for kids.  Did you know that Steve Jobs was an executive-producer?
user2: Wow! I did not know that. I'm sure that added to the purity and imagination of the movie! Critics say that it is one of the best voiced animated movies! Would you agree? 
user1: I would - even Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head - I had to look that one up as I didn't realize that's who it was.  John Lasseter did a great job directing, even as it was his first film
user2: I did not realize that either! I did know that Tim Allen played Buzz Lightyear. It was great casting and created a believable friend relationship between him and Woody. 
user1: Indeed. The scene where they Buzz is given as a gift at the party is a really cute way to introduce a character - but I guess as a toy, it's a wonderful idea
user2: Yes! I could not agree more. It is a beautiful representation of friendship as the work together to be reunited with their friend Andy. I think it really does give kids the right idea. 
user1: So true! it's ingenious that the toys use baby monitors to communicate back and forth - adorable and something kids can easily relate to.  
user2: Agreed! I love the added characters such as the slinky dog and Rex. I believe that it added many different personalities to the movie! 
user1: For sure.  It's good too that they can all come together and work as a team - kids can benefit from such positive examples.  
user2: Yes! The examples here provide so many real life examples. I love that it gives kids an idea of how moving affects the family too. 
user1: It's sad though how Woody starts to feel upstaged by Buzz - we've all been there though.
user2: I agree. It lets kids know the different interpretations of a moving situation can affect other characters. 
user1: Can you believe they get stuck in the crane game!  How silly :) 
user2: Haha! I could not believe that scene. I do think that is one of the scenes that makes the movie a comedy genre. 
user1: It's interesting that even when thinking about toys, the idea of jealous comes up like when they think Woody knocked Buzz out of the window.   Drama - even in the world of toys!
user2: Right! I think this movie is so interesting! What is your overall opinion of the movie?
user1: It's really good!  Just like some of the critics say "a work of genius!"
user2: I agree! I love the scene where Woody and Buzz attempt to make it in the moving truck. It is so suspensful! 
user1: Indeed!  I love when the dog chases them - and his name is Scud - hilarious!!
user2: I think that it is interesting to see how many skills Buzz has. He really is a complex character. 
user1: For sure - he can even fly which is so wonderful! 
user2: Yes! I do believe that is why Woody grows to be envious of him
user1: I think you're right. The ending was adorable though - the puppy is a whole new world of mess!  

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hi there! The movie that we're going to discuss today is Toy Story - a 1995 movie starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Have you seen it?
user1: If you haven't seen Toy Story, I would highly recommend watching it. Despite being an animated movie that's typically stereotyped for younger audiences, there's a certain charm and warmth to the idea of toys coming to life and both Hanks and Allen did an incredible job of not only keeping what is an interesting story going, but also bringing those characters to life.
user2: Can you describe the plot?
user1: The premise around the movie is the relationship between Woody, a cowboy toy (voiced by Hanks) and a Space astronaught, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Allen). Both Toys are striving to be accepted and loved by Andy, the boy who owns both Toys.
user1: Andy's family is in the process of moving, and both Woody and Buzz get separated from Andy. Throughout the film, both Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and work together to be reunited with Andy and the rest of the toys.
user2: That sounds awesome.
user2: I will definitely watch it! 
user2: What is the score o rotten tomatoes?
user1: Great question! Rotten Tomatoes gave this Comedy ./ Action adventure movie a 100% score, with an average of 9.10.
user2: Sounds great! My daughter would probably love it.
user1: Are you a fan of animated movies like Toy Story?
user2: Yes, I love pixar
user1: That's great. One of the interesting things about this movie is how the toys pretend to be lifeless when kids are around, but when nobody is there they spring to life. That adds such depth to the movie.
user1: One of the most interesting parts of the movie I think is the introduction of Buzz, which comes early on. Andy's birthday results in the boy getting a new present, which is Buzz. This brings an element of insecurity forth in Woody's character, as he has always been Andy's favorite toy.
user1: You mentioned your daughter would love it, and I think you're right. My boys are glued to the screen whenever this movie comes on, and they make it a record of seeking out Buzz and Woody toys when we're out.

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: do you like Tom Hanks ?
user1: Hi
user1: I do, I like some of his stuff better than others
user2: so did you watch Toy Story?
user2: h performed as Woody which was a string -pull cowboy doll
user1: I have not seen the whole movie, only small parts of it.
user2: Pixar produced it in 1995
user1: Oh, wow I didn't know it was that old
user2: it is
user2: and it had a great ratings in both rotten tomatoes and cinema score
user2: do you know about the other cast members?
user1: Who are some of the other actors?
user2: Tim Allen as Buzz
user1: He has to be pretty funny
user2: Jim Varney as the slinkey dog
user1: I don't know who that is
user1: Was there a female lead too or that was in another one? I think there are a few out now.
user1: I may have myself confused.
user1: Is there any other big names?
user1: Do you have any other info?

conversation:
user2: Have you ever seen an animated movie in which Tom Hanks was a voice character?
user1: yes\
user2: Which movie was that?
user1: toy story
user2: Who was your favorite character?
user1: george cloooney --buzz lightyear--
user2: Ohh Buzz is a good one! I think Slinky Dog is my favorite
user1: haha yea the martians were probably my close second
user1: my little girls favorite is slinky
user1: are you gooing from your movie document?
user2: Also a solid choice! Your daughter has great taste!
user2: And yes I am
user1: shes as aninmated ast any dreamwork film lol
user1: and kk awesome.
user1: you know toy story was dremworks first picture?
user2: lol nah I'm just really passionate about toy story and finally found my outlet. 
user1: also ithe company was bought by steve jobs bc it was failing and he turned it into a billion dollar empire
user1: haha that's cool
user2: I thought it was a pixar/disney film
user1: haha you are correct i suck
user1: but the dremworks thing still true.
user2: Did you know this was the first feature film that John Lasseler directed?
user1: i did not 
user2: Now you know!!
user2: When was the last time you watched Toy Story?
user1: actualy yesterday
user1: lol
user2: wow way more recent than me lol
user2: I should watch it again
user1: yea i tend to watch a lot of movies over and over
user1: toddlers and all
user2: yeah children definitely get to dictate what's on TV lol
user1: it's really a groundbreaking film for it's time
user1: the birth of cgi
user2: it was the first ever feature film that was 100% computer animated!
user1: whatttt!!
user1: i am not as informed as i thought i was
user2: haha my document really helped me 
user1: i also think im still mixing deamworks/pixar
user1: that's awesome we learn something new everyday
user2: it was also the first film pixar produced
user1: ah that's where im getting those ideas
user2: yeah toy story is def pixar/disney
user1: it just wasn't dreamworks
user1: kk 

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello!
user2: hows it going
user1: It is going good! Thanks for asking
user2: You see Toy Story
user1: Yes I have, it is really good
user2: I loved it when I was a kid it was such a unique special film
user1: I agree. I might watch it again sometime. My favorite character was woody
user2: Plus who doesn't love tom hanks
user2: they picked literally the most charming human being in history at the height of his powers to voice woody
user1: Of course. The voice was perfect for the character. He is pretty charming, especially at that time in his life.
user2: Toys coming to life is like a basic fantasy for every kid too.
user1: Should I watch the movie today?
user2: Absolutely I think it still holds up. It has a sort of classic buddy comedy feel with the ticking clock of Andy's family moving to drive the drama.
user1: It seems like a sad movie to watch today
user2: Woody, Reex, Sarge and everyone integrating with Buzz Lightyear is a great dynamic as well
user2: I think it still has a hopeful tone to it
user1: What sort of hopeful tone?
user2: Well after Buzz and woody end up fighting and falling out of the window and end up going to pizza planet and getting stuck in the crane game. You kind of think that its all down hill for the characters
user2: but even tho they are picked up by andy's evil neighbor Sid
user2: They manage to start working together
user1: When they start working together, do they get back home away from Sid?
user1: Or does Sid capture them forever?
user2: he
user2: captures them
user2: and uses them for his experiments
user2: or at least he plans to
user2: but then wood and buzz start to work together
user1: How do they get away?
user2: Well just as buzz is strapped to a rocket and about to be destroyed
user2: woody organizes the other toys and recuses him
user1: That is so nice!
user2: Then as they are trying to catch the moving truck woody and buzz get jumped by scud
user2: and woody has to leave buzz behind
user1: Oh no!
user2: but when he gets to the moving truck he and RC go back to rescue buzz however RC starts to run out of batteries
user1: That is bad luck
user2: Then woody decides to light the rocket on buzzes back
user1: I thought Buzz was in the truck?
user2: no woody had to go back for buzz
user2: because of scud
user1: Oh ok, so what happens next

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: hi, you should really check out this really great movie called toy story. Its got amazing actors like tom hanks and tim allen.
user2: Is it a movie for kids, or families or adults?

user2: Was there a musical score to it? 
user2: Was it controversial in any way?
user2: Was there any sex or violence?

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: Hi there!
user2: Toy Story was my childhood when it first came out. 
user1: I actually didn't know that Toy Story came out in 1995...it doesn't feel that long ago. Now I feel so old. 
user1: Mine too!
user2: It’s insane that it has such a high rotten tomatoes score, too. 
user2: Then again it is a cinematic masterpiece, even now. 

conversation:
user2: Hi :D
user1: how are you?
user2: I am great! How are you?
user1: Doing well, what info do you have on the movie?
user2: It is Toy Story (1995), have you seen it before?
user1: I have seen it quite a bit
user1: It's one of my more favorite movies from childhood
user2: I just saw it again recently, it is different from how I remember!
user1: how is it different?
user2: Well, I didn't remember how mean woody was, I think I was confusing it with part 2, I believe he was nicer?

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you today?
user1: Hey I am doing great :) 
user2: Great to hear. Have you seen any good movies lately?
user1: I watched toy story with my son yesterday for the first time of him watching it and he loved it
user1: Tom hanks plus tim allen is the best duo
user2: I love that movie. My son is grown now but absolutely loved it when he was a kid
user1: Did you know that Don rickles played mr potato head?
user2: Yeah, he was great! I loved Don Rickles.
user2: I love how the movie was fun for both kids and adults
user1: Yeah its a damn shame how thats not the case anymore with kids shows :=(
user2: Did you know that the script was written by Joss Whedon? The same guy who made "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and also recently directed "The Avengers" movies?
user1: Oh wow no I didn't realize that! I love both of those as well
user2: I also love how any time an adult or kid walks into the room that all the toys "play dead"
user1: or at the end when they freak out there bad neighboor oh what was his name again?
user2: Spike?
user1: Oh! right!
user1: I love the look on woody's face when buzz first makes an appearance 
user2: Tim Allen was great as Buzz. Just totally full of himself until he learns he's a toy and finally becomes humble by the end of the movie.
user1: Yeah that scene when he knew he could fly and failed was a very very good life lesson for kids
user2: Pixar makes good movies but Toy Story is still my favorite one
user1: yeah the 2nd and 3rd ones are just as good to which is a rare thing
user1: for more than just the first movie to be as good
user2: I love the sequels!
user1: Oh the kids name is Cid spike is his dog i think
user2: I think I have seen the first one over 50 times. My son watched it religiously for quite a few years.
user2: Oh, you're right! It's Sid.
user2: In one of the sequels he is the garbage man!
user1: Oh man and you gotta love Randy Newman's soundtrack as well
user1: Oh no way really!?
user2: I love "You got a friend in me"
user2: Yeah, he's the garbage man and he's still wearing the same shirt!
user1: oh man now i gotta watch the next two today with my son
user2: It was nice talking to you. Have a nice day.

conversation:
user2: I thought Tom Hanks as Woody was so good in Toy Story! What did you think?
user1: I liked Tim allen more. 
user1: Why did you like Woody.
user2: I tend to like cowboys. I agree that Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear was also a great casting decison.
user2: What did you think about that scene where Buzz realizes he's a toy?
user1: I suppose the juxtaposition of the two is what made it work. 
user1: I don't recall that scene, to be honest. 
user2: He's sitting on a landing and when the camera pans out you see him realizing that he's just a little toy. 
user1: I'm not sure about that, sorry. 
user1: Did you agree with the critics?
user2: I totally agree that it's a work of genius.
user1: Yeah, it's pretty crazy what pixar can make interesting. 
user2: It get's 100% on rotten tomatoes which is not easy to do
user1: Yeah, I was wondering about that as well. Even the most revered moved don't do that. 
user1: What did you think about when andy first got buzz?
user2: I was immediately worried about how Woody would react. Funny how the movie makes us anthropomorphize toys.
user1: I think it does the anthropomorphizing for us. 
user2: Definitely. Who was your favorite secondary character? I enjoyed Mr. Potato Head. He's such a character.
user1: Actually mr. potato head was my favorite as well. I can appreciate a cynic. 
user1: Do you really think woody knocking buzz out of the window was an accident. 
user2: I was just about to ask you the same thing! I really think that it was an accident. Woody is not a villain.
user1: But he did feel pretty left out.
user2: I think that's understandable since he felt like he was being replaced. 
user1: But the other toys probably felt the same with woody. 
user2: Probably. I thought the scene where the neighbor Sid ends up getting the toys was pretty intense. What did you think?
user1: I appreciated the escape scene with the rocket. 
user2: I liked when Buzz and Woody started to become friends and help each other.
user1: Yeah, once they started working together it changed a lot. 
user2: What was your favorite friendship moment between Buzz and Woody?
user1: Oh I suppose the reconnaissance mission. 
user1: Yours?
user2: I liked that part and how at the end of that scene they found out that Andy got a puppy for Christmas
user1: I guess that part didn't stick out in my mind. 

conversation:
user1: Hello, How are you today?
user2: Hello fine and you?
user1: I'm pretty good. What did you think of Toy Story?
user2: I have just seen Toy Story and it is simple amazing. Did you see it?
user1: Yeah, I saw the movie when I was a kid.
user1: So you liked it a lot?
user2: Yes for sure. I like animation stories and particularly this one was really nice. Tom Ham Hanks as Woody is a perfect match.
user1: Ah, I am the opposite. I am not a fan of animated films, so the movie wasn't as hyped for me as it was for others.
user1: I will agree I liked Tom Hanks, he brought the character to life in the film.
user1: Would you say he was your favorite character?
user2: Difficult to say. Also Buzz is really nice. 
user1: I never knew Tim Allen played Buzz, I was surprised to see his name in the credits.
user1: I think my favorite character was the Slinky Dog.
user1: I just wish he had more of a part than he did.
user1: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE STORY?
user2: Yes it was a surprise for me also. I completely agree with Rotten Tomatoes 100% and Metacritic 95 score. 
user1: I think those scores are a bit over the top personally.
user1: I would give the film a solid 8.
user2: On Andy's party scene the plan of the toys to look at the presents was really funny.
user1: Yeah, the movie had a lot of great scenes.
user2: And Buzz thinking he is really a space ranger also make me laugh a lot.
user1: That made me feel bad for him honestly.
user1: Despite the character being funny.
user2: Also Mr Potato Head for me was one of the most funny characters.
user1: He was a really goofy character, I think everyone enjoyed him.
user1: Out of 10 how high would you personally rate the film?
user2: In my view it would be 9.5
user1: That is fair considering you like the animated movies.
user2: When Woody was jealous for Andy preference to Buzz he was really hard knocking him right?
user1: Yes, I was surprised how much the toys fought over Andy.
user1: There were a lot of hidden messages in the film, but I am not sure many people caught on to them.
user2: Actually I didn't get that much. The Pizza Planet part was really breathtaking right?
user2: What a tough child was Sid right? Very bad for the toys.
user1: The pizza planet was interesting, in fact, a lot of the scenes were well done.
user1: Sid was a typical bully character, you see people like that in almost every animated film.
user2: Woody controlling Buzz and RC car back to the truck also was a really nice scene.
user1: I think my favorite scene was when Buzz introduced himself to the others for the first time.
user1: Him thinking he was stranded on a different planet.
user2: Yes that was nice for sure but the action scenes for me were the most attracting part of the movie. 
user1: I agree with that,
user1: Thanks for chatting with me. It was fun!
user2: Thanks a lot. It was really nice.
user1: Have a good day.
user2: You too

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hi!
user2: Are you interested in animated films?
user1: Yes. Pixar films are my favorite.
user2: Cool. This one here, Toy Story, is very good. Have you seen it?
user1: Yes! It was one of my favorite movies as a kid. How does it hold up now?
user2: I think it holds up great. My kids love it and they are 6 and 8.
user1: Nice! I do have to admit that I like toy story 2 better than the first one.
user2: I think I do too, but both are great. 
user1: agree. I wish they would come out with an "enhanced" version where they update the animation for the first movie.
user1: the people look a little creepy in it
user2: That would be cool! I would definitely buy that.
user2: Haha, they do
user2: I loved the voice acting in it.
user1: ya, tom hanks is always great
user2: He is awesome. Him and Tim Allen really did a great job in this one.
user1: I can't imagine anyone else playing them
user2: The ratings for this is through the roof! I always knew it was a great film, but these scores are perfect
user1: are you looking at rotten tomatoes?
user2: Yes
user1: critics do love pixar films
user2: Seems so. I never really check for reviews.
user2: Did they make a part 3?
user1: they did
user2: Wow, I never knew that. I may check it out soon
user1: the same kid who played andy in the first movie played andy grown up
user1: which is neat
user2: Yeah, that is definitely cool
user1: it also has good reviews
user2: Awesome, I may have to rent it for the kids this weekend

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you watch Toy Story?
user1: Yes, I have! Have you?
user2: Yeah, I love that it has the voices of Tim Allen and Tom Hanks, they play great together don't you think?
user1: Oh absolutely!  I think it tells a very heart warming tale, a childhood classic for sure.
user2: Yeah, obviously CGI has gotten better since then, but it has a real razzle-dazzle look to it.
user1: I think it is what what makes it a really great film. I also think the heft and believablility Tom Hanks brought to his Woody, really makes the whole film worth while.
user2: Yeah. I never had any cowboy toys growing up really, but I'd have loved to have some space figure like Buzz. What about you?
user1: I also was much more of a space figure kind of kid, I only had a few cowboy action figures, most of which were Woody from the film because I was so inspired by his character. 
user2: That's cool. You know, I didn't know that Jim Varney was even in this movie until recently? I really like him though so it was awesome to find out. Who did you like most in Toy Story?
user1: I would have to say Tim Allen as Buzz was my favorite at the time, by as I grew up I learned to appreciate the director John Lasseter. Did you know it was his directing debut?!  
user2: I did. He really knocked it out of the park. A lot of stuff works shockingly well in the movie, so he deserves a lot of credit. The glory days of Pixar started strong. But yeah, Buzz is cool too, even as an adult I like the childish charm.
user1: I completely agree, I especially like the scene when Buzz was introduced to the film. It was very creative and a great introduction into the concepts covered by the rest of the film. 
user2: Yeah, they did justice to most of the characters despite a pretty large cast. I liked Don Rickles as comedy relief as Mr. Potato Head a lot more than the comic relief from Rex, but Rex was still pretty adorable for his part. Gotta have some broad appeal to different audiences, right?
user1: I think that is what made the film such a success is that they hit such a wide audience without overwhelming the viewer, probably why it did so well in the ratings! 
user2: Yeah, for sure. So aside from Buzz and Woody who could obviously carry a story on their own, who would you most watch a spinoff of? I think the green army men could be really entertaining to watch, if they found a way to keep it fresh and interesting for an entire feature.
user1: Oh that would be very amusing, but I always thought a film around Wallace Shawn
user1: Wallace Shawn's character would make a great film as well, Rex is really funny!
user2: You can't go wrong with dinosaurs right? I like how Rex kept if feeling light, even with some of the darker stuff with Sid.
user1: He was definitely a nice, bright, relief. I really enjoyed how to film developed into a quest for two enemies to find their way home after being lost. I think that is such a great concept! 
user2: A great way to come together, just find common ground against an even worse enemy! Haha. Buzz thinking he was a real toy played well with them being in real danger I thought.
user1: That was by far one of my favorite scenes! What did you think of the great scene with the claw machine? 
user2: The CLAW! Yeah I have to admit that those toys of the little three eyed aliens were a lot of stupid childhood fun for me. Something about them.
user1: I love those little things, I'd love to get my hands on one now! It was just such an inspirational film.
user2: Yeah. What about the scene where they fly with the rocket? As a kid I kind of wanted to be buzz right then. Looked like a lot of fun, danger regardless of course.
user1: Oh I was always envious of RC that looked like a wild ride!
user2: I still want a human sized RC car because of that, heh.
user1: haha for sure! I will still always remember the worried look Buzz and Woody gave each other after they say Andy's new best friend, do you?
user2: Yeah, I thought it was a cute clever way to wrap up the movie. The life of a toy beautifully captured.
user1: Absolutely, thank you for having a conversation with me, have a great day!

conversation:
user1: Hello there!
user2: Hello Hello :)
user2: Have you seen this movie before?
user1: I have. It was one of my favorites growing up!
user1: Have you?
user2: Sure have, was a personal favorite of mine years ago. I love pixar and Tim Allen
user1: I like how Pixar movies are entertaining for kids as well as adults.
user2: same here! It's interesting to look back at this film thinking about how Buzz comes to the realization that he is just a toy
user2: do you watch many animated films?
user1: I will if they look interesting. I'm not a big fan of animated movies specifically geared towards kids though.
user1: What's your favorite Pixar movie?
user2: hmmm hard choice but Ratatouille is awesome. Crazy to think that this came out in 1995 over twenty years ago
user1: I know! I still remember seeing it in the theater.
user1: I think my favorite is still The Incredibles.
user2: as a kid this movie always made me wish my toys would turn into living things
user1: I remember bursting into my room sometimes trying to catch my toys talking to each other. :D
user1: Was Buzz Lightyear your favorite character?
user2: ME TOO!! I even used to keep tabs on where i left them to see if they had moved
user2: Haha i was just about to ask you something similar. but i would have to say my favorite was mr potato head
user2: who as it turns out was Don Rickles (i wont pretend to have a clue who that was) but who was your favorite charactor?
user1: He's great! My favorite is probably Hamm.
user1: I liked the scene where the two of them play Battleship.
user2: snap I forgot about Hamm, do you remember that kid sid and his messed up toys?
user1: Ooh, yeah. I always thought he was kind of scary. I don't think I knew anyone who treated their toys like that.
user2: Neither did I, Don't think i knew of any kids with firecrackers at his age either. where the hell were his parents! i vaguely remember him having a sister....maybe
user1: Yeah, she had a sister. I remember there was that one scene where Buzz saw a commercial for himself. I think Sid's dad was asleep in front of the TV.
user1: But yeah, definitely a messed up home life. ;)
user2: that definitly rings some bells, i also totally forgot about his dog. oddly enough i kind of liked his dogs name. scud lol
user1: Yeah, something like that. I think the dog was a more important character in the second movie.
user1: Do you have a favorite scene?
user2: Never saw the second movie, But i do remember at the end of the first movie andy got a Puppy.
user2: Hmmmm
user2: probably the whole Pizza planet scene, that place was looked like a less traumatizing version of chucky cheeses that was actually fun
user1: Yeah, that placed looked hecka fun!
user1: I liked when the army men went on their reconnaissance mission to see what toys Andy was getting.
user2: do you more or less agree with the ratings they gave the movie?
user1: I agree. It's starting to look a little dated by today's technology, but the story still holds up. :)
user2: that scene was a gem. i forgot about that, and andys mom steps on one of them
user1: Well it looks like we're done. Take care!
user2: cheers :)

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: What can you tell me about the movie?
user2: Hello Have you seen Toy Story?
user1: Yes, I have.
user2: It’s a Pixar movie and it’s about a little boy named Andy and he has toys that come to life when he’s not around 
user1: That's right.
user1: Can you tell me more about the movie?
user2: It’s the first movie in a trilogy and I think they may be making another one in the near future. At least that’s what my kids tell me 
user1: I know that I've seen at least the first two.  I'm not sure if I've seen the third one.  I don't think that I've heard anything about a new one.
user1: My kids are grown, and I don't have any grandchildren yet.
user2: Well, they have an excellent cast of voice actors. Tom Hanks is the voice of Woody, he’s a cowboy toy. And Tim Allen is the voice of Buzz Lightyear. Those two are the main characters 
user1: Do you know any of the other voice actors?
user2: They start out as enemies in a sense and then become best friends 
user1: It does take them a while to get to know each other and to adjust to each other.
user1: I think that a lot of us are that way when we meet someone new.
user2: Yes John Ratzenberger the guy who played on cheers also is a voice actor in the movie. He plays ham who is a little piggy bank very cute
user1: I think that the Slinky dog is cute, too.
user2: Yes slinky dog is very cute as well. My favorite character is the T Rex he supposed to be so big and strong because he’s a dinosaur but he so scared it’s very cute
user2: I can’t believe this movie came out in 1995 and that it is almost 23 years old. I remember when it first came out and it was very popular and even now 23 years later it’s still a very popular film amongst children
user1: I like Slinky dog, and Mr. Potato Head.  Mr. Potato Head is funny.
user1: It seems that there are a lot of popular Pixar films.
user2: Did you know that the director John Lasseter also directed the cars movies? And I do believe that he is the CEO of Pixar which is very cool
user1: I wasn't aware of that fact.
user2: Yes he has a lot of amazing movies that he has directed. And I believe that a lot of them will become Classix if not already are
user1: You might be right about that.
user2: Toy story laid the foundation for all computer-generated movies I believe
user2: When it first came out it was very new to have a movie look the way that toy story did
user1: Yes it was.  Pixar definitely has made quite a few advancements in terms of computer graphics.
user2: My kids really loved this movie and they also think that their toys come alive when they’re not looking. And even to this day now that they are a little older they still believe that their toys come alive when they’re not in the room. And it’s also cute because they believe that they should play with their old toys just as much as their new toys so that the old toys don’t get jealous like the ones in toys story did
user1: I've never thought that my toys come alive when I'm not looking.  I guess that I'm not very imaginative.
user2: It really is a great film and it’s a lot of fun for children and adults alike. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that has not seen it yet and I would also recommend the cars movies as well and any other Disney Pixar movie they’re all very well directed and made
user1: I've seen at least the first Cars movie.
user1: Disney certainly is a major part of the movie industry these days.
user2: Yes I agree and I believe he will continue to do so
user1: I think that both Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time are Disney movies.
user2: Yes in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies as well or Disney. There are a lot of movies that I have seen that I was not aware that we’re Disney movies
user1: Do you have anything else that you want to add before we finish this conversation?  I noticed that the "finish conversation" button is now active.
user2: I also read in the document hear that Steve Jobs was a cool executive producer as well and that I did not know
user1: I did not know that.
user2: No thank you this was an enjoyable conversation thank you for your time

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you saw this movie?
user2: no
user2: what's it about?
user1: You should, it's a great family movie.
user1: It's about a group of toys that come alive.
user1: Do you have children?
user2: no but I like toy story
user1: The group of toys are rivals at first, for their owner's attention
user2: is it like toy story?
user2: that sounds interesting
user1: Yes, it's that movie.
user2: oh! which one? the first one?
user2: is there an evil neighbor?
user2: are you still there?
user2: hello?
user2: are you still there?
user2: if you aren't there anymore
user2: I'm going to abort the convo
user2: okay. I'm aborting the convo

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: Hey, are you there?
user1: I am! 
user1: Okay, so the movie I need to convince you to watch is Toy Story. 
user2: So what movie are we talking about?
user1: The original 1995 Toy Story
user2: All right, haven't seen that one.
user2: I think I've only seen some sequel or something.
user2: Can you tell me some actors that did the voice over for the characters in the movie?
user1: I definitely think you should watch the original because it establishes the plot for the subsequent movies 
user2: Yeah, I guess you're right.
user1: Tom Hanks is plays Woody, the protagonist. Tim Allen is Buzz Lightyear, the second protagonist 
user2: Oh, I totally love Tom Hanks and I think I've heard of Tim Allen as well.
user2: So, what's the movie about 
user1: The movie is a kids' movie, but it was the first feature-length movie made entirely by computer animation. It's basically about these toys that come to life
user2: I understand...I now remember some parts of other Toy Story movies. The animations were awesome.
user2: Can you please tell me a bit more related to the plot? What are Woody and Buzz trying to do?
user1: Their owners (Andy and his family) are moving to a hew ouse and they somehow get left behind during the move, so Buzz and Woody (plus a few other toys) make this crazy journey to Andy's new house.  
user2: Hmm, that seems really interesting
user2: What else?
user1: Buzz and Woody were initially not big fans of each other, but as the movie goes on, they grow to become best friends. 
user1: Some of the most important plot points: 
user2: Yeah, from what I know they were best friends
user1: When Buzz originally meets Woody and his group of friends, Woody's friends were quite impressed by Buzz's high-tech gadgets. Woody was not a fan. 
user2: I see...seems like a great start though!
user2: What else happened throughout the movie? And if you can, please also give me some teasers about the ending.
user1: The two eventually find themselves in a situation where they could easily be killed/ruined by Andy's destructive teenage neighbor, who is known for violently smashing and blowing up toys. This forces them to become allies in order to save themselves. 
user2: Hmm, nice development!
user1: After several hiccups, Buzz, Woody, and the other toys left behind eventually complete their journey to Andy's new house
user2: Also, I would like to find out more about the critical response of the movie? Was it good/bad/mixed? What did critics say?
user2: Because I usually prefer to check out the rating of a movie before watching it. Of course, I prefer those with good rating (7/10 +)
user1: The critics all gave consistently high scores. Rotten Tomatoes gave it 100% 
user1: Metacritic gave it a 95/100, and CinemaScore gave it an A.
user1: All the detailed reviews were full of praise regarding plot development, attention to detail, and the general concept of the film as a whole. 
user2: Wow! I'm amazed! Those are some scores huh
user1: They really are! There are very few movies with an RT rating of 100%, so I'm glad this got the ranking it deserved. 
user2: Anyways, from what I hear, they are justified!
user2: All right then, thank you for your chat and for informing me about this movie!
user2: Have a good weekend, goodbye!
user1: You're welcome! It was nice chatting with you and I hope you check Toy Story Out!
user1: Bye!

conversation:
user2: Have you seen Toy Story before?
user1: Yes I have I love woodys character 
user1: have you seen this 1995 comedy?
user2: Yeah I've seen it multiple times
user2: My favorite characters are the T-Rex and the Piggy Bank.
user1: I am not surprisee it has gotten such high ratings on rotten tomatoes
user2: It's a masterpiece of cinema.
user1: This is like one of the first CGI movies ever produced by the company that would become pixar
user2: I think they were already pixar when they made this.
user1: Disney studios produced yet another great master piece have you seen any of their other earlier works 
user2: Probably I was a little kid when Toy Story came out.  It's hard to remember all the movies I've seen.
user2: Where was Andy's dad?
user1: actually this is the first movie ever made in cgi form by pixar that was disney at the time they were not the hit nor were they big until this 
user2: Seriously where was Andy's dad?  He's not in any of the 3 movies.
user1: there were big name actors included in this to help move it, tom hanks, tim allen, and don rickles
user1: this also helped debut some other careers like that of director john lasseter, have u seen any of his other works? 
user2: Did you know Tim Allen was arrested for marijuana and it wasn't like a small amount it was POUNDS.
user1: did you know thats not part of the movie or how this works? 
user1: This is the first animated comedy action adventure movie made by cgi format, have you seen other cgi formatted movies?
user2: Just seeing if you would respond to anything since you ignored my questions.
user2: Yeah Toy Story 2 and 3. 
user1: its not up to me to answer ur questions why dont u do what the hit calls for
user2: A conversation is two people talking not one just spitting out random crap.  Wow Tom Hanks was in the movie durd durdy dur.
user2: Mr. Potato Head is a toy from Hasbro he is also in Toy Story.
user1: The slinky dog played by jim varney was great he walked around sounding like ernest, you do know who that is dont you? whole series dedicated to him.
user2: All the toys from Toy Story would go on to be real toys in toys stores. 
user2: Pizza express is the pizza place in the movie.
user1: The toys come to life at night and when people arent around, and oddly enough they were all toys based on real life toys from the time era
user1: you do realize there is a time era to this movie of the 60s
user2: Buzz and Woody weren't real toys at the time of this movie.  So that's a lie.  They became toys after the movie was released.
user1: the ratings for this movie fro cinema score gave it an A which is highly appropriate, since this movie
user1: omg you need to pay attention to what is actually being said....i am reporting you for violation of this hit
user2: It was set in the 90s.  They didn't have toys like Buzz Lightyear in the 60s.  
user1: woody is based on howdy doody u have no clue

conversation:
user1: I loved toy story
user2: Hello, do you feel it is worth watching?
user1: yes definetely, it has 100% on rotten tomatoes
user2: Great! and what is that you like most about it?
user1: i loved the concept of the toys being alive when no one was watching
user1: it was also very funny and had adult themes
user2: Is it made with hand-drawn animation, like, for example,The Jungle Book or Snow White/
user1: no it is more computer-animated from pixar 
user1: do you like animated films
user2: I love them. it is my overall type of movie, since it is the most likely genre I can watch my the entire family.
user2: are there villains in this movie, somebody playing the bad guy?
user1: yes this is a family friendly film
user1: there isn't really a main villian but there is competitiveness and rivalry between the main characters of woody and buzz
user1: then circumstances with a bad charcter cause them to cometogether 
user2: Wow, sounds really interesting. Any famous acors lending their voices to the characters?
user1: tom hanks voices woody and tim allen is buzz
user2: They are excellent actors so no wonder how many people give good reviews about that movie. Do you think it will not be too scary to toddlers or small children?
user1: i think it will be appropriate because it is a family movie, it is not geared toward being scary
user2: Sounds good. Another thing I look forward to when thinking of a family movie is the score. Do you know any song of the movie or, by the way, who makes the music?
user1: the score is wonderful and helps with the movie watching experience in this movie
user1: i do not know who does the score 
user2: OK, anyway it should be good. I wonder  if being a toy story , does it have in the cast any famous toy you can buy in a store?
user1: well the characters like woody, buzz, and t-rex are all charcters in a film about toys, but are fictional and not based on real life toys, im sure you can buy them in the store now however
user1: sid phillips is their neighbor and he is the scary villian in the movie, so he might be a little frightening for kids but other than that the movie is very kid friendly 
user2: Thanks for mentioning Sid, i will try to work out with my kids on that. I cannot wait to get one of those toys for them before going to the movies with them!
user1: yes if they play with them and see them on screen they will be more attached to the movie
user1: especially when they see all the adventures the toys get into like when the toys have to get out of the house and get into the car
user2: Wow, sounds like a very interesting scene.. and a very interesting plot.
user2: Who wrote the story?
user1: yes the toys are alive when no one is around and have adventures
user1: the director is john lasseter
user1: the screenplay was by lasseter, pete doctor stanton ans joe ranft
user2: Wow.. sounds like a good plan.You can count me in to rent it for the weekend!
user1: good it has really good themes for kids like friendship and jealousy and working together
user2: Great. Ok. Thanks a lot for your information and recommendation.
user1: have a good day
user2: thanks you too

conversation:
user2: Hey
user1: Hello.
user2: This movie brings back memories, my first date lol.  solid ratings, wow, didn't realize rotten tomatoes had it at 100%
user1: From the info found on this document, it appears that this is a very highly acclaimed movie. 
user1: It has been out for quite a while now hasn't it?
user2: yes indeed, the characters are very engaging.  And Tom Hanks voice
user1: It's also really interesting to note how far the graphics have evolved since the time of this movie.
user1: I remember being amazed at the time, but retroactively looking back it has aged pretty harshly.  The voice acting like you mentioned is still top notch though.
user2: yes indeed.  Definitely was more intriguing at a younger age 
user2: forgot about Tim Allen being the voice for Buzz Lightyear
user1: It's pretty interesting that "Slinky Dog" was also supposed to be a dachshund...I guess it makes sense looking back but at the time I just though generic dog...
user1: It looks like they have given us a bit more information now.
user2: threw al the toys off by moving the party up a week
user1: Have you ever thought about how odd it is that Buzz thinks he is a real person, but instinctively turned into a toy when a child came near?
user2: yeah good point
user2: maybe a "natural instinct"
user1: I guess it is suppose to be sort of like that, a natural instict
user2: And then there is Buzz being the showoff.  not a good impression on the others
user1: But it was crucial to show character development. 
user1: Oh, I also remember how Sid was such a horrifying character...
user1: Or at least the toys in his house.
user2: Sid was very creepy
user1: I feel like it was mostly the animation at the time and how crude it made him look.
user1: It really fit the character's personality.
user2: Yes, but he did add that extra element of an antagonist.  
user1: The RC scene with the moving truck was pretty fun as well.
user1: It added a bit of excitement to the movie considering how static a lot of it was.
user2: That scene when they are trying to escape sounds very "edge of your seat".  
user2: And the rocket escape, totally forgot about that
user1: Hahaha, it was very...convenient? 
user1: But served as a redemption to Buzz early in the film trying to fly.
user2: The Christmas day reconn mission waiting on the new toys
user2: yes it was
user1: Oh I remember how retrospectively the puppy was cute / terrifying to the toys.
user2: BUTTTT Andy got a puppy lol
user1: I guess a puppy makes everything better.  I wonder if they thought they were going to make a sequel at the time with the dog involved.
user2: Possibly, or just an average ending.  
user1: I guess that's more likely then.
user2: I think this is the first computer generated animated movie, off topic but yeah I don't think thhey had a sequal planned based on the ending
user1: I believe that there were other CGI movies prior but good point about it being from Pixar as one of their first.
user1: Good chat
user2: bye!
user1: Finish Conversation is available now, so enjoy your day.

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: Hey have you ever seen the movie Toy Story
user2: I have seen it, but it's been a long time hahaha
user2: how about you?
user1: Yes, I really like it. Its a really fun movie. 
user1: I love the deep meaning behind it. Woody realizes he can't always be the favorite
user2: yes, indeed! that's what's amazing about that movie
user2: is the fact that it holds such a deep meaning
user2: what's the ratings it got?
user1: Yep. It got like 9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes and Cinema Score of A. 
user1: Why can't they make more movies with great characters anymore :(
user2: how much of percentage did it get on Rotten Tomatoes?
user1: 100%
user2: HOLLY MOLLY!
user2: it deserves it
user1: Yeah, I know that is a rarity
user2: well, I think that Disney still make some amazing movies with amazing characters today
user2: like Up, and my personal favorite Inside-Out
user1: Sometimes. I like the old ones better though
user1: Oh yeah, inside out is GREAT. 
user1: I actually think adults like the Disney Movies as much as the kids
user1: Hey do you know how much longer we need to chat?
user2: Oh
user2: I think we need to exchange replies, like 5 times
user2: not too long
user1: What is your favorite Disney Movie
user2: Wall-E and Inside Out and Up
user2: what are yours?
user1: Lady and the Tramp and Cinderella.  But Toy Story is great too because of Tom Hanks
user1: Tom Hanks brings Woody to life.
user2: Tom Hanks is just amazing
user2: I couldn't agree more with you
user1: Yes he is. Give me a whole new view of toys. I knew they came to life at night. Hahaha!
user2: Which is your favorite Tom Hanks movie?
user1: Toy Story 
user2: hahaha, that's obvious
user2: no, seriously! I mean live-action movie
user1: The one where he is ship wrecked
user2: Oh! "Cast Away"
user2: that's a very good one
user1: Yes, that's it!
user2: have you ever watched his movie The Green Mile?
user2: Oh! before you go
user2: if you haven't seen The Green Mile
user1: Oh yes I live that one!! Forgot about that
user2: I highly recommend it
user2: Oh! great
user2: it was nice talking to you
user2: have a good one! bye
user1: Nice talking with you too

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hi! Do you like Animation movies?
user1: Yes, I do. Computer animated, haddrwan, stop motion, anything
user2: Have you ever seen Toy Story?
user1: Yes, I was interested to see it, but never saw it
user1: What is the story of Toy Story ?
user2: It is a great movie, about toys who come to life when their owners aren't presnet
user2: The two main toys are a cowboy doll and a astronaut action figure
user1: it there an explanation why they come to life ?
user2: I don't know, but it might explain on their website.
user2: Pixar website, I mean
user1: But it not a plot point in the movie. It is ok, a movie should not explain everything. What kind of animation is this movie ?
user2: It was released in 1995 as the first feature length computer animated film.
user2: It was also the first film produced by Pixar
user1: I find computer animated film sterile and lifeless, how to you did you find the movie visually ?
user2: I thought it was very believable, and the toys appeared to be truly alive
user2: I think it helped that they brought the character of the toys into the film
user1: I will trust you on that anything else that you find great about this film ?
user2: So , in the beginning of he film, Woody is Andy's favorite toy
user1: what is the personallty of Woody?
user2: Woody is a Sheriff doll, and is the leader of all the other toys. Then Andy has a birthday party and receives an astronaut toy, Buzz Lightyear
user2: Buzz becomes the new favorite, and Woody gets jealous
user1: Does it gets dramatic or funny ?
user2: A little of both. Woody ends up accidentally knocking Buzz out the window, and the other toys rebel against Woody.
user1: What happens to Woody ?
user2: He gets taken to Pizza Planet with his owner, but on the way he and Buzz get in a fight at the gas station, and then they get left behind
user1: So there is a lot of action in this movie ?
user2: Buzz is convinced he is a real space ranger, and he and Woody get stuck in a crane game, and taken to Andy's neighbor's house, Sid.
user2: I don't know how much action you would consider it to have, but it is an adventure.
user1: I did not know it was an adventure movie. I could have been a drama with just toys talking about themselves. As for the movie,  how is Sid ?
user2: Sid is a bit mischevious, and has a dog, Scud, that chases after them
user1: How does the chase end ?
user2: They escape Sid's house and are chasing after Andy's moving truck, and Scud chases after them
user2: Buzz saves Woody from Scud, and Woody uses Andy's RC car to rescue him.
user1: There is a lot of action, I I like this
user1: How does the film end ?
user2: It is a really great movie, Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 100% rating
user2: It ends with the toys back with Andy at his new house.
user1: How do you rate the movie personally ?
user2: It is one of my favorite movies
user1: Good, You convinced me to see it.
user2: Great! 
user2: Thanks for chatting today!
user1: Thanks and have a good day.
user2: You too
user1: bye

conversation:
user1: classic animation from back in the day
user2: Do you have a favorite character of all the toys?
user1: I really like the idea of Buzz coming to the understanding that he is a toy as existential crisis. no favorites though. You?
user2: The crisis of a seemingly tough guy arrogant character like Buzz is interesting since it can be compared to lots of people in real life in some sense. I liked Mr. Potato Head because he's bitter and it I found it funny watching him get dismembered from time to time
user1: Ha, yeah. It's funny Tim Allen was so iconic as the tool man, it's interesting that he can be equally iconic as a cartoon. 
user1: I did not realize that joss Whedon was one of the writers.
user1: Really some 90's power players.
user2:  a great actor usually has the ability to express their unique charm in a variety of different genres
user2: I didn't realize he was one of the writers either, dang
user1: I guess. Not sure that old Timmy would be high on my list of great actors.
user1: took me a second to realize that joel cohen wasn't joel coen 
user1: just out of curiosity, are you really a real person. 
user2: Lol old Timmy..I enjoyed several of his roles, enough to give him that personal respect of mine. To be off topic though my kind of actors are the badass tough guys like pacino, pesci and de niro
user1: I feel like that could affect how you felt about Tim Allen's acting.
user1: Those guys are all great. I always thought ray liotta was under rated as a tough guy.
user2: I'm a highly sophisticated humanoid robot
user2: awesome dude as well
user2: I loved casino
user1: never saw that one. I am pretty impressed, some of your language is not quite what I would expect from a real person, honestly the tim allen thing was the tip off. 
user1: I like the competition between the old school hero, in the form of cowboy, and the new school hero buzz.
user2: Out of curiosity what is it about my language that you would not expect from a real person, particularly the tim allen thing
user1: So I would say the mixture of using sophisticated or correct language when talking about informal things.
user1: real people aren't as good at using english properly
user1: Do you think Woody meant to knock buzz out of the window?
user2: I've gotten that before. Well, I'm 24 and English-writing was one of my two majors in college. I guess I converse in a more formal fashion than most while typing online, I'm not so much like that in person. But no damn it, I'm not a robot, though it would be cool to be some sort of modified cyborg.
user2: I think the snakes in the boots may have contributed but it's a possibility
user2: never mind the plural
user1: I really think this movie opened up the animated film genre tho, and i am glad that it came out.
user1: never minded 
user2: Definitely one of my favorites growing up, I loved it. The second one was cool too but I never saw the third, I don't know if there was another
user2: I have a very sad memory of that doll Jessie hanging off the back of a truck trying to hold on
user1: I actually never watched them when they came out but have since. They seem to stand the test of time. 
user2: When I have kids they will definitely watch them... a lot of the crap that's put out now is just not the same
user2: So what are we supposed to do here
user1: There is still great stuff coming out! I feel like this task has not followed the way it was supposed to. I thought we were going to get more than one thing to read.
user2: I think we should take a screenshot of this and both of us report it to the requester
user1: what would screenshot do?
user1: oop i see that finish convo is available now so I vote for that. 
user2: I took one already, I can send it to them if they want proof that we have been doing this task. We should not complete this HIT because it could get rejected, so let's both try messaging the requester and asking that we please be compensated since we spend a lot of time trying to do this. They are usually nice about it and will create a make up HIT for us. When you message the requester include your worker ID
user2: OH OK lol cool
user1: Have a good evening tho. 
user2: Thanks you too

conversation:
user2: Hello how are you?
user1: Good, you?
user2: Great! Have you seen this little known film called Toy Story
user1: Yes, have you?
user2: Plenty of times! How would you rank them compared to other Pixar films
user1: I thought it was cute with a great story line, much like many of the other Pixar films.
user2: Are you likely to see it again?
user1: Probably, I have 2 young boys, so it's a great movie to watch with them!
user1: Did you like the music sound track of the movie?
user2: Sweet! I just remember that one song ‘You Got a Friend in Me” but it’s quite nostalgic for me to hear it since I grew up with the movie 
user1: Yes, that's a catchy one! Which character was your favorite?

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hi
user1: have you watched the move toy story before?
user2: my document isn't showing up. I don't know what movie we're supposed to be discussing.
user1: it is about toy story
user2: Oh! No I haven't seen it.
user1: 1995 one, the first one of the series
user1: ohh really, how come? you do not like animated movies
user2: Not at the time it came out lol. I have kids now so I like them but we've just never watche it.
user2: What exactly is it about?
user1: it is a classics movie for animation
user1: the title says it all, it is about a story of toys
user1: toys became alive when humans are not present
user2: ok
user1: they know that they are actually toys
user1: except one, Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut toy thinks he is real, not a toy and can fly in space 
user2: Does Tim Allen do one of the voice overs?
user1: yeah, he is the Buzzlightyear
user1: also Tom Hanks is voicing the other main character
user2: I thought so. I like Tom Hanks as well. He's the cowboy right?
user1: yeah
user1: the movie is about the (somehow) challenge between the cowboy and the Buzz Lightyear
user1: they are both trying to be the best toy
user2: Ok. 
user1: do you have questions about the movie?
user1: I do not want to spoil it for you
user1: it is a must watch movie for everyone
user2: I'm just trying to figure out the premise for the movie. Why do they want to be the best toy?
user2: You won't spoil it for me.
user1: because they are a toy
user1: they want to be played all the time with the 6 years old kids who owns them
user2: Awe, ok. I see now.
user1: actually the movie is about a rescue mission of one toy, who was left behind by accident, while they were moving to a new apartment
user2: So the cowboy and Buzz are in a competition of sorts?
user1: they are at the beginning
user2: Are they friends by the end?
user1: but then cowboy is trying to help Buzz to get them back together
user1: yeah they are all friends, also in the second and third movies
user2: I didn't know there was more than one.
user1: there will be a forth one in 2019
user2: Well thank you for all the info. I'm gonna watch it with my kids.
user1: anyway, nice having chat with you
user2: you too.
user1: have fun with the kids while watching the movie
user1: see you

conversation:
user2: Hey! Have you seen toy story?
user1: No I have not, what is it about?
user2: it has a 100% on rotten tomatoes
user2: its an animated movie about toys
user1: Oh wow that's a really good score. How old is it?
user2: it came out in 1995 but is a cult classic and is not boring and still relevant 
user1: Interesting, have they ever released any sequels for it?
user2: its about when people are away the toys come to life and go on adventures
user2: i actually do not know if any sequels are out just that it is really popular
user1: It sounds interesting. Does it have any famous voice over actors?
user2: yes tom hanks plays woody and tim allen is buzz, don rickles is mr. potato head
user2: these are just some of the characters there is ahuge famous cast
user1: Very interesting. Do you know if it's a long movie or short movie?
user2: i do not actually know the length of the movie just that it involves the toys and their owner andy
user2: its about how a new toy buzz comes into their lives and takes the shine away from woody the main character 
user1: Okay well it definitely sounds very interesting. How are the quality of the digital effects?
user2: it is apixar movie so they are very good plus it has a cinemascore of an A
user1: Oh wow that's excellent. Does the movie have any draw backs in your opinion?
user2: i would say if you are not into animated films watching the film may be something you hesitate on but the themes are very universal and it is enjoyable 
user2: definetely something you should give a chance 
user1: hmm okay. I thought the movie sounded a little childish but the voice actors makes me want to watch it. I wonder if the storyline is completely childish and cartoony. None the less, I'm interested in it. 
user2: it is really kid friendly but the overall concepts of being overshadowed and even being an outsiders makes it enjoyable
user2: even jealousy is touche don
user1: Interesting. So it sounds like it has some mature undertones in it. Does the movie take place indoors or outdoors primarily? 
user2: it really takes place in andy's room where the toys live but they do travel outside in certain scenes which makes the adventure part of the movie more interesting
user2: its fun to watch them interact outside in the real world
user1: Can you give one example of a place they travel to outside of the room?
user2: they travel to a restaurant called pizza planet and they have to sneak into a car to do it, and you can imagine all the funny things that happen for that to happen
user2: especially cause they do not want to get caught
user1: That sounds interesting. Isn't there a character in it that can fly around?
user2: so buzz the new character introduced has wings but actually cannot fly, he thinks he can but really can't
user1: Ahh okay I see. Well it sounds really interesting and entertaining. I heard that Buzz, the character that thinks he can fly, is voiced by a famous actor. 
user2: he is voiced by tim allen 
user2: the movie even has a villian making it more interesting
user1: Very interesting, I did not know that but it makes it sound even more interesting. 
user2: yes and even you see buzz and woody's friendship evolve from enemies to best friends
user1: Well I will take a look into this movie and read more into it as it sounds quite interesting. Especially if it has sequels out for it. 
user1: Take care!

conversation:
user1: hey! what do we got?
user2: Hello.  We got a classic.  It's called Toy Story.
user1: Great movie!
user2: Yep, came out in 1995 and has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: Pretty rare to get a score that high
user1: I'd say thats pretty good
user1: I can't recall who was in it?
user2: Tom Hanks plays Woody (a cowboy doll), and Tim Allen plays Buzz Lightyear (a space ranger action figure).
user1: Nice, do you know who directed it?
user2: John Lasseter, and it was his first movie that he directed.
user1: wow, pretty good start
user2: Right?
user1: I'd say so, what else can you tell me
user2: It was also the very first feature-length computer-animated movie.
user2: And Pixar's first film.
user1: really? I actually did not know that
user1: to both those
user1: I am trying to remember some scenes...
user2: Same here.
user2: Well, Andy (who is the owner of the toys) is supposed to have a birthday party, but it gets rescheduled because they are preparing to move.
user2: They hate birthday parties because sometimes the toys get replaced.
user2: But instead of a replacement, Buzz is brought into the family.
user1: Yup, Woody wasn't worried at first
user1: the way that Tim Allen portrayed Buzz Lightyear was priceless
user1: How long is the movie?
user2: You know, I actually don't have that information.
user2: A big part of the movie is the fact the Buzz doesn't realize he is a toy.  He thinks he is a real space ranger.
user1: oh, okay thats fine
user1: Yeah thats what I was talking about, his laser beam hahahaha
user1: when he chokes with his helmet is opened
user2: Haha yea, that is classic.  They end up at Pizza Planet and get stuck in a toy machine, which is where the neighbor Sid gets a hold of him.
user1: ugh I hated Sid
user2: Yea, he was a twerp.
user1: His poor toys.
user2: Indeed.  Anyway, they get back to safety and the movie ends with Christmas.  They family gets a new dog.
user1: such a great movie, I don't think i own it or if I do its misplaced
user1: I might have to find it now
user2: Yea, I haven't seen it in a long time.
user2: Well, it has been nice talking with you.
user1: I am definitely going to be watching it
user1: yup you too!
user2: Have a good one!
user1: Thanks, you as well!

user2: AWDQC79NQLHO
user2: forget to review ... If it's a wonderful children's movie
user1: Yes it is! Who was your fav on the show? I love Woody and Buzz.
user2: apologize send something by mistake. If I liked it a lot, it's a film, I think it appeared in the year 1995
user1: Yes it did come out a while back. wow 1995, that makes me feel old haha
user2: definitely woody is very nice and charming
user1: I was totally fascinated by the thought of the toys actually being alive.. I wish that were something that was true when i was little lol
user2: if it's been quite a few years ha ha
user1: Did you think Tom Hanks played a good Woody? I think his acting is amazing
user2: Usually a fascination occurs as when the animals talk.
user2: This actor did very well.
user1: I think the cast picked out for the toy story films were excellent choices. 
user2: Yes, his performance was very clean and charming.
user1: Yes i do agree! I wonder why Rotten tomatoes gave it a 9 out of 10 rating? That's crazy. I say 10/10! 
user1: what was your favorite scene of the movie?
user2: This type of awards are very demanding. For the time it was the best movie, they give him more credit now. Apart is classic children.
user1: Oh yeah maybe i am sure
user2: is when toys begin to take life.
user1: I love when Buzz Light year actually just gave up on life and was dressed as a woman that was hillarious
user2: to come to life
user1: Do you like the style of the movie? how the animation was created?
user2: If I really like the style
user1: I like the style as well. It was such an upgrade from the old disney style (to 1995)
user2: is a children's computer animation film directed by John Lasseter
user2: is very good
user1: Well we can end the convo now! great talking to ya!
user2: is great

user2: Toy Story
user2: have you watch it
user1: Yes! It looks like I would like the astronauts character Buzz Lightyear! lol
user2: The rating were over the roof 
user2: great movie
user1: It seems Buzz isn't very popular at first with Andy, 
user2: Tom Hanks did amazing job 
user2: as Woody
user1: how funny that they used army men to spy on them
user2: Pixar studios are great,all theirs movies are amazing
user1: So Buzz Lightyear doesn't know he's a toy?
user2: and Woody is scared that Andy will chose Buzz
user1: Its so funny to me that Buzz believes hes a real space ranger. 
user2: he trap him behind the desk,that part was intense haha
user2: funny and little sad in the same moment 
user1: Oh how cute! I just read about the green dino named REX
user2: And Mr. Patato
user1: Is it like the toy in real life? Mr. Potato Head?
user2: Toy Story have amazing production and in 1995 it was new moment for the animated movie industry
user1: so it seems BUZZ and Andy become friends?
user1: The ending seems great! They are worried about Andy getting a another new toy for Christmas. 
user1: He luckily doesn't get a toy but a dog.
user1: which is kinda irronice
user2: that was interesting
user1: ironic 
user2: yeah
user1: my dog is always chewing my daughters toys
user1: goodbye
user1: looks like we are done
user2: yes
user2: bye

conversation:
user2: hello 
user1: hi
user2: I'm going to talk to you about this movieToy Story
user1: awesome!
user1: im also goint to talk to you about toy story
user1: it is a great childrens movie
user2: you know this movie, you've seen it
user2: Toy Story is a children's movie of computer animation

conversation:
user2: Hello. We have Toy Story, 1995
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: I have seen this movie many times! Have you?
user2: I have! Love Tom Hanks as Woody.
user1: Me too. I didn't know Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay...that's pretty interesting. 
user2: Jim Varney's Slinky Dog is also a fave of mine.
user2: Me either
user1: Tim Allen was fantastic in this movie too. 
user1: Steve Jobs was apparently a producer as well? I didn't know a lot of this stuff.
user2: Buzz, yes. loved him
user2: I had no idea either
user2: This was Disney's first feature-lenght computer-animated film
user1: I haven't seen the movie in probably a decade. I wonder how it would hold up as an adult.
user2: I saw it not too long ago. It was still good, but not like I remembered it as a kid
user1: I think we have gotten more used to computer-animation so it's probably less impressive than it seemed back then.
user2: Probably so.
user1: I forgot about Bo Peep!!! 
user2: ANd Hamm the Piggy Bank
user2: They were always so afraid of being replaced.
user2: the party, christmas, lol
user1: I remember that this movie definitely made me think my toys were alive
user1: Do you remember THE CLAAAWWW
user2: It's funny how they basically wrote a whole movie over toys not wanting to be thrown out.
user2: YES. and the Aliens. "OOOOOOH, AHHHHHH"
user1: It's probably a metaphor for life somehow, like "we all want to feel valuable and like we have worth"
user2: Sid....ugh
user1: Sid was terrifying.
user2: Is this the first Disney movie where no one was killed off?
user2: A super rare occurence. 
user1: Oooh that's a good question. 
user1: Where was Andy's dad?
user2: I was just thinking that MAYBE that was Disney's casualty here
user2: What might be worse than Buzz...."a PUPPY!!"
user2: love that at the end, lol
user1: a PUPPY!!!!! 
user2: Oh, and the army men.
user1: I forgot about a lot of this plot. But whenever I see an old white pickup truck I definitely think about PIzza planet.

conversation:
user2: So.. Toy Story, I love this movie.
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: No, I haven't. Whats it about? 
user2: One of the first animated movies made. It's a (mostly kids) movie about toys coming to life when their 'owners' arent around
user2: Not in a sinister way at all, it's actually pretty cute
user2: Tom Hanks is Woody ,and Tim Allen is a new toy called Buzz Lightyear. They are rival toys because Woody is a basic wood doll and Buzz has tons of features and lights. 
user2: Anyhow, the kid is moving and the toys are trying to avoid being misplaced or thrown away
user1: Wow...How did I miss that? Sounds interesting. I kinda like kids movies sometimes. I love Tom Hanks. 
user2: Honestly, depends on your page. it's from 1995 and I was only 10 when I First saw it
user2: age, not page!
user1: LOL... So it a comedy/drama sorta movie? Who plays the kid?
user2: The document doesnt say... and I dont recall
user1: Does it have a sad or happy ending?
user2: Oh, totally happy.
user2: It's a Disney movie!
user1: Ok, good. I hate sad endings. Oh, Disney! Now I am even more perplexed as to how I missed it. 
user2: Yea, gets excellent reviews too. 100% for Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Is it more for girls or boys you think? 
user2: Very original when it came out
user2: Both
user1: I think I might watch it with my niece. How does it compare to Disney movies now? Since it is so old.
user2: Same kind of story.. the animation is 1995-esque haha
user2: I wouldnt call the music as popular, this isnt in the document, but Randy Newmans "youve got a friend in me" is featured
user1: That is a cute song in my opinion. but I ususally have a different opinion than others
user1: I take it there is some action in this movie as well
user2: A little bit, mostly involving flying around, not in an exaggarted super hero way though
user1: Is there a "bad guy" typically there is!
user2: Oh yea
user1: What kind
user2: Buzz starts as a bad guy, the neighborhood kid is also kind of a bad guy, but the biggest bad guy is the idea of throwing the toys away.
user1: neighborhood kid? Like a bully?
user1: This sounds great. I am definitely going to watch it. Thanks for all the info.
user1: Are you still there?
user1: Other party has not responded in over 2 minutes

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Yo
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: You seen toy story?
user2: Of course, I used to have a Woody doll bro
user1: classic film
user1: i had a mr potato head figure
user1: haven't watched in years, 1995 was a long ass time ago
user1: put it in your top 10?
user1: still there?
user1: hello?
user1: why open a HIT only to abandon it?

conversation:
user2: Hello! What movie will we be chatting about today?
user1: Hello the movie is Toy story.
user2: Oh, a classic pixar :)
user2: I have not seen it in ages.
user2: When was it released? I'm curious.
user1: It is a comedy, animation Adventure movie. And yes, a classic Pixar movie. 
user1: I saw it a long time ago also
user2: Yes, I would say it is all of those things!
user2: Does it have good ratings from critics?
user1: t was released in 1995 by director Jaoh Lasseter
user1: It has a 100% by rotten tomatoes.
user2: Wow... 95! I was only 6 when it came out ha! It was definitely popular when I was little.
user2: Wow... 100! Rotten tomatoes doesn't give out 100s easily.
user1: Tom Hanks was really good as Woody.
user2: I totally agree
user2: The perfect voice for woody 
user2: Was there any other big names in the movie?
user1: Tim allen played Buzz lightyear
user1: Don Rickles was perfect for Mr. Potato head.
user2: Ohhh, that's right. I forgot about Tim Allen.
user1: They were all worried about what And was getting for his birthday.
user1: Andy
user2: Ha! This is when he gets Buzz, right?
user1: Woody was feeling left out because Buzz Lightyear was getting all the attention
user1: Buzz thought he was "Real" and not a toy
user2: A little jealousy amongst the toys!
user2: Oh yes, I do remember that. He tries to fly, I believe.
user1: They did that little strategy to spy on the birthday party
user1: To infinity and Beyond !!!
user2: Haha! The movie is all coming back to me now.
user2: It really is such a cute movie. One that you can still enjoy as an adult, I believe.
user1: Yes, and the next birthday. What can be worse than Buzz ?  Andy get a puppy !!!   hahahahah
user2: Horrific! Haha
user1: And Rex was a Tyrannosaurus rex figure, but he was always so nervous. 
user1: Very nice talking to you

conversation:
user2: What can I say? This is a classic! Great movie.
user1: This is a great film! The cast is the best part!
user2: I know, especially Tom Hanks. I can't imagine anyone else for the part of Woody.
user2: 100% on Rotten tomatoes. That's rare.
user1: And a CGI film in 1995, the first of its kind.
user2: Yeah, can't believe it's been so long. Makes me feel old!
user1: Do you generally like Disney films?
user1: I know that they're some of my favorite.
user2: Yes, I do.  This one by far is one of my favorites.
user1: What character did you like the best?
user2: So this is one of the first Pixar film...
user2: I like the Mr. Potato head...
user2: I also like Buzz. It's funny how he thought he was a real space ranger.
user1: The misadventures the toys had are good memories
user2: I agree. It's fun to think how toys come to life when we are not looking.

conversation:
user1: Did you ever watch Toy Story?
user2: I have seen all three.  I never realized that Joss Whedon had a hand in the movie.
user2: Were you on Team Woody or Team Buzz when they were competing for Andy's affection?
user1: I'm not familiar with Whedon, I only watched the first one.
user1: Buzz!
user1: You?
user2: Woody was quite a jerk in the first movie.  
user1: Yeah, I thought so too.
user2: It really did break barriers for Disney entering the computer generated animation field.
user1: Plus I thought Buzz was kinda clumsy and more likeable
user1: For sure!
user1: I think that's the main reason it was such a hit.
user1: How were the other 2? I never watched them
user2: I think 3 is my favorite of the set.  It had a lot of emotional moments and call backs to the first movies.
user1: I might need to watch it. So I can catch up.
user2: I really liked the green army men in the scene this paragraph is describing.  It made me look at them a new way.
user1: I remember the only reason I went to see the first one was because my daughter was of the age at the time and I was looking for a kid appropriate movie
user1: True. They were kinda funny.
user1: I thought TIm Allen was the right match for the voice over of Buzz
user2: I still have trouble throwing away my kids toys because of the way the toys were given personalities and responded to being discarded.
user2: The voice actors were all amazing.  
user1: I used to have an extensive collection of Army Men.
user1: My mom threw them all away. :(
user1: I guess to your point they were all screaming when they hit the trash can
user2: The CLAW!!!  I love the aliens and the crane game scene.  
user1: Yes. Those machines are impossible to operate.
user2: I love looking for the Pizza Planet truck in all the Pixar films.
user1: I kinda found Potato Head to be likeable.
user1: likable
user1: Oh and Rex!
user2: I have an obsession with the claw games and this movie probably helped add to that.
user1: Ha! I don't even know where I would find one anymore.
user2: You gotta figure that a dog would be a toys worst nightmare.
user1: Did't the dog eat some of the green army men?
user1: I can't remember
user2: I don't think we ever get to see the dog actually interact with the toys in the first movie.
user1: Oh, okay. I really need to check out the other 2 movies.
user2: I guess if the movie were made today, Woody and Buzz would have been riding a drone instead of rc car.
user1: But now that you told me, I'll probably skip the second one.
user1: Yeah good point!!
user1: Or one of those 2 wheeled scooters
user2: The second wasn't bad but is definitely the weakest of the 3.  
user1: I can't remember what they are called.
user2: Oh yeah!   I could see them trying to operate a hoverboard.
user1: How did you stick out with even watching the third one, if the second one was not that good?
user1: I would've quit then.
user2: By the time the third came along, I had kids of my own and took the oldest to see it with a church group.
user1: SegWay. That's it
user1: Makes sense.
user2: I am glad that Buzz and Woody ended up being friends.
user1: Was that in the third movie?
user2: Well, even at the end of the first they were working together and had come to an understanding.
user1: Or event he first one. I can't remember, it was a while ago
user1: Right!
user1: Funny because to this day if I were to imagine toys that had a voice it would sound like Tim Allen.
user2: I could see that.  All Mr. Potato Heads sound like the toy story one in my head as well.
user1: The voice of Potato was the guy from that sitcom Cheers, right?
user2: I think so and Mrs. Potato Head later was the voice of George's mom from Seinfield.
user1: Oh, I never really watched Seinfield, but sounds like I missed out.
user2: This kind of makes me want to go watch the movie again.
user1: Ha. I was actually surprised Rotten Tomatoes gave it that high of a rating. Aren't they  generally pretty brutal with their ratings?

conversation:
user1: The movie is Toy Story".
user2: Great

user1: They are relieved after a while but then there really is a new toy.
user2: That sounds pretty good
user1: It is a space ranger doll called Buzz Lightyear.
user1: Tim Allen is the voice of Buzz.
user2: I remember seeing buzz lightyear all over, hs character looks hillarious 
user1: Buzz later on becomes a friend to Woody.
user1: But at the beginning Woody feels left out as Andy the boy favors Buzz.

user2: Who is your favorite character
user1: I like Rex most.
user2: What is his character
user1: He is a nervous green T-Rex toy. It is hilarious to see a nervous dinosaur.
user2: Lol that sounds great, I think I will rent it. My kids would like it
user1: The rating on Rotten Tomatoes is pretty high, too. 100%
user2: Oh wow that is a grea rating I dont think I have seen one that high 
user1: In the end the toys discover that the birthday gift really is a puppy.

conversation:
user1: Hi! Wow, Toy Story is a great movie!
user2: It certainly is!  
user2: Who would you say is your favorite character?
user1: We're not the only ones that think that, it received a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100!
user2: I can understand why.  With a cast like that it was sure to be a hit.
user1: Yes, I love Don Rickles as the voice of Mr. Potato Head! Who is your favorite character?
user2: Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor, he was a great choice for woody.
user1: Yes, Tom Hanks was great as Woody! I also liked Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.
user2: They pair very well together also.
user2: It is so impressive that Toy Story was the first feature length computer animated movie!
user1: I know Pixar is amaxing, they did a great job with John Lasseter directing.
user1: The premise of talking toys is great oo.
user1: too.
user2: And that cast of writers! Joss Whedon- I had no idea he was part of that
user2: Or that Steve Jobs was a producer
user2: Oh my- the talking toys are so brilliant. An entirely different but so familiar world
user1: The entire cast is amazing, I had no idea Steve Jobs produced the film. 
user1: Yes, I loved the fact that the toys wanted Andy to like them so much, a new twist.
user2: yes, and the connection between andy and woody was so sweet
user1: It was sweet. The scene where they go to Pizza Planet was hysterical.
user2: also the moment of realization when buzz figures out he is a toy is truly great writing and voice acting
user1: I loved when Buzz thought he was a real space ranger and got them stuck in the crane game. 
user2: The aliens are a personal favorite! 
user2: I also thought the writers did a good job of making Sid the bad guy, teetering on the edge but not going too far into making him scary.
user2: And I really really enjoyed his payback at the end!
user1: Yes, the mischievous neighbor Sid was scary, but not too bad. 
user1: I liked when Buzz tried to impress all the other toys.
user2: Yes, he had quite the ego in the beginning!
user2: I thought the operation the toys set up to monitor the birthday party was hilarious too.
user1: Yes he did! It was nice when they became friends though and Buzz saved Woody while they were moving. 
user2: The rocket scene at the end was really suspenseful for a cartoon!
user1: Yes, that was great. And the other toys that thought Andy had hurt Rex and Buzz was such a misunderstanding. 

conversation:

user2: I like buzz because he is an action figure.
user2: He is really cool.
user2: and why do you like woody?
user1: to infinity and beyond
user1: i have always been into cowboys
user2: Do you know the rating of this movie?

user2: Me too. I never thought that rotten tomatoes will give such high score!
user1: me neither but it was ahead of its time with graphical technology

conversation:
user2: Hey there!
user1: Hi
user2: How are you?
user1: I am doing well. How about you?
user2: I’m great as well
user2: So, what movie are we discussing today?
user1: Toy Story
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: I have seen it and liked it a lot. You?
user2: I’ve seen it as well, but I just think it’s like any other movie
user2: What did you like about it?
user1: I thought it was good because it helped to to understand the toys.
user2: Right, yeah
user1: I liked Tom Hanks as Woody
user2: It’s Pixar’s right?
user2: I didn’t know it was Hanks actually
user1: Yep. Pixar did it. 
user2: Yeah
user1: I like Hanks voice.
user2: Did you like this one or the sequels best?
user1: I liked this one better.
user2: Me too
user2: Have you seen both sequels?
user1: I have seen all of them. This one was better because Buzz Lightyear actually found out he was a toy. It was funny, but realistic.
user2: Great points, I absolutely have to agree
user2: Would you watch it again after so many years?
user1: I watch it at least once a year or so. I like the animated stuff.
user2: Do you like it more or less each time you watch it?
user1: I think I like it more.Watching the slinky dog and Mr. Potato head does not get old. They are funny.
user2: Haha, Mr. potato’s definetely the best.
user2: Do you think this is your favorite movie?
user1: Which one did you like best?
user2: Animated movie at least
user2: The second one, I guess
user1: It is one of my favorites. I feel like Buzz finding out he is a toy is how we all fell when we grow up.

conversation:
user2: Hello good day
user1: Hi! Have you seen the original Toy Story?
user1: It was released in 1995. 
user2: hi ohh yes yes I like that movie

user1: My son is all about some army men, so he'd love Sarge.
user2: ahaha;; You  have a lovely kids 
user2: let them watched the 2 series
user1: The part where the kid, Andy can only take one toy to dinner really resonates. We are the same with our kids. And they can never decide which one. 
user1: Andy ends up taking Woody instead of Buzz. But then Buzz hitches a ride on the car anyway, it was so funny.
user1: I guess  more cute than funny.
user2: Ahaha.. I hope it will have a part 3 in the future.. Toy Story got the kids have fun to watch
user2: yeah I remeber that part when buzz flies ahaha
user1: Mr. Potato head was fun too in the movie. 
user1: And how the toys are always worried about the new toys coming in. Like on Christmas morning and then Andy gets  a puppy haha.
user2: yeah it was brocken in 2 pieces ahaha.. I dont remember the name of that character has a spring body ahaha.. and the big eye
user2: yea yeah ahaha..   the movie was too long now but it was fun to watch again

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Toy Story seems to be highly rates
user1: *rated
user2: yeah, it has some really good scores on various rating sites.
user2: it has some really good animation considering it was created in 1995
user1: Yeah it sure does
user1: Don Rickles was Potato Head huh. I did not know that
user2: Me either. 
user2: I think Woody is my favourite character. I've always liked Tom Hanks.
user1: There's a lot of great people in the cast
user1: Yeah Tom Hanks is a great actor
user2: Yeah. Tim Allen was pretty good as Buzz Lightyear though too.
user1: Yeah he's a good actor too
user2: The scene with army men spying on the birthday party was really funny.
user1: Birthday parties are seen as a threat to the toys. that's interesting
user1: Yeah those army men were cool
user2: Bo-peep was another favourite of mine.
user1: Oh she was pretty wasn't she
user1: There are a lot of fun characters
user1: Like Slinky dog and t rex
user2: I like the way there are so many classic toys as characters. Makes it easy to relate to. Most people had at least one of those toys as a kid.
user1: Yeah they did a good job with that
user1: Pizza Planet sounds like an interesting restaurant lol
user2: I always felt so bad for woody when Andy started to like Buzz better.
user1: Yeah that's sad
user2: Yeah it does. But who doesn't like pizza?
user1: Buzz Lightyear seems delusional
user1: Yeah good point
user1: Sid Phillips seemed creepy
user2: Yeah, Buzz was a wee bit delusional.
user2: and yeah, he was pretty creepy
user1: Oh no Andy gets a puppy
user1: Puppy's need a lot of attention
user2: That scene was really exciting when they chased the truck on RC
user2: oh, no, puppies chew toys!
user1: It's fun to think about your own toys coming to life
user1: Haha yeah everything becomes a chew toy
user1: Oh yeah thanks for chatting with me about this movie
user2: It was so satisfying when they landed in the box next to Andy. 
user1: Yeah
user2: I was so happy all the toys were safe and made it to the truck.

conversation:
user2: hello, how are you today?
user1: Hello! I'm great, what's on your mind today?
user2: Well I just finished watching the movie Toy Story, it's a great film you should really watch it!
user2: It's a classic!
user1: Cool, what's it about?
user2: wells it takes place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, the plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure. They fight for the affection of Andy, their owner. They later become friends and work together to be reunited with Andy as his parents prepare to move homes!
user2: Doesn't that sound amazing?
user1: That does sound awesome! Any other cool plot points?
user2: well the plot also contains an array of extremely cool other dolls like Slinky Dog, a dachshund slinky toy played by Jim Varney! and Rex, a nervous green T-Rex figurine played by Wallace Shawn
user1: Nice! Who play's Buzz and Woody?
user2: So Woody is played by the amazing Tom Hanks, and Tim Allen, another great actor, plays Buzz!!
user1: I think this sounds like my kind of film... anything else cool about it?
user2: well, it's a film that received a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes! That should tell you how amazing the movie is. There's also this very interesting scene where Woody organizes all the toys in a scouting mission during Andy's birthday to find out what new toys he got! Green army men toys spy on the party and report on baby monitors. All of them are happy to find out they haven't been replaced by new toys, until Andy receives a surprise gift-- Buzz! It all makes for an interesting story line
user1: That sounds like something my kids would really enjoy! I love the rating!!
user2: yeah it's perfect for kids. It's a comedy with animation and a lot of Adventure. It is an older film, produced in 1995, but it still holds to this day
user1: Oh wow. I guess it's stood the test of time. I like animated comedies! This movie sounds pretty neat. 
user2: yeah, and its directed by John Lasseter, so you know it's well directed
user2: the critical responses are all so positive as well!
user1: Nice! I can't wait to see it. Sounds like my type of film.
user2: of course, do you want to hear another plot point that will definitely make you want to go see the film?
user1: YES PLEASE!
user2: so Andy goes out on a family outing to Pizza Planet and his mom lets him bring one toy. Woody fears that he might not get picked and tries to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of a window!! 
user1: Oh wow! What happens to them?
user2: well Andy decides to take Woody to Pizza Planet but when the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz caught a ride with them and they fight at the gas station only to find that the family has left without them! 
user2: They catch a ride with a Pizza delivery truck and make it back only to get stuck in a crane game where they are salvaged by Andy's own neighbor, Sid Phillips!
user1: Ouch! That poor toy. I hope he has better luck later!
user2: they do! But they have to go through Sid Phillips to get back! As they try to leave Sid's place, Sid's dog gives them a chase of their lives. Woody makes it to the moving truck but Buzz is left with Sid's dog. Woody then tries to take Andy's RC car to save Buzz while trying to fight against the other toys that think Woody is trying to kill Buzz and RC!
user1: Oh no! What happens?
user2: well the toys realize their mistake in thinking Woody is trying to kill Buzz and RC and try to help Woody and Buzz and RC get on the moving truck but RC's batter dies! Woody decides to ignite the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck while gliding with Buzz through the air before the Rocket explodes and glide safely back into the box in the car right next to Andy!
user1: Aww nice! I like that!
user2: yeah, the ending is really sweet too. They move into their new house and on Christmas, Buzz and Woody try to prepare for the new toys that might arrive and to their surprise Andy gets a puppy!
user2: isn't that just the cutest?
user1: That is! I think i'm gonna love this film!

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: Good morning!
user2: How are you?
user1: Good thank you. When do you think the last time is you watched Toy Story?
user2: When I was a kid, I don't remember much of it
user2: probably almost 20 years
user1: wow!
user2: How about you?
user1: Yeah it's been a long time for me as well. It's a really good classic Disney movie that teaches good lessons to kids
user2: I agree.
user2: They ended up making a couple more right?
user1: Yeah, I think there is at least three
user1: Who is your favorite toy friend of Andys? I like mister potato head lol
user2: That's what I thought
user2: Bopeep
user2: I feel like we talked the other day
user2: haha
user1: I don't think so lol I haven't been on amazon in a couple of weeks 
user2: who knows :)
user2: I like the little green guys from that claw machine
user1: Oh yeah! I love that sceen when they are trapped in the claw machine
user2: Same!
user1: It's so sad when Buzz hitches a ride on the car at the gas station
user2: Oh yea
user1: because he thinks he is a real ranger and ignores woody
user2: Do you remember that creepy spider thing with the doll head
user1: yes!
user1: So crazy
user2: I wonder if they'll make more in the future
user1: I forgot that andy gets a puppy for christmas
user1: They probably will make more, they keep rebooting everything
user2: True
user2: I think Pixar does a good job
user1: I think so too

conversation:
user1: This was a funny movie
user2: Yes it really was.  I loved Woody.
user1: Woody was funny but I kind of started liking Buzz by the end of the movie. 
user2: Yes Tim Allen did a really good job as Buzz Lightyear.
user1: He really did, I could almost see their faces as I got more into the movie. I always wondered how they actually film these movies like this.
user2: I'm not sure how it's done.  But the technique is awesome.  John Lasseter did a really great job for his first time being a director.
user1: Yes, I agree, but this movie is over 20 years old. The movies that are out today have great graphics, but I love the old versions the best.
user1: You know I never realized that Don Rickles was the voice of Mr. Potato Head. 
user2: Don Rickles was too funny as Mr. Potato Head.  I really loved the Rex.
user1: Now the Rex I don't remember too well, but the actor Wallace Shawn, do you know him from other films? 
user1: What genre of movies do you generally like? 
user2: No I don't know any other films with him.  I generally like horror.  I love animated films to watch with my children.  I love Toy Story.  

conversation:
user2: hello!
user1: Hi!
user2: I just saw Toy Story and it actually made me cry!
user1: Toy Story is a really good movie for being the firsst feature-length computer-animated film
user2: Its directed by John Lasseter.  I kinda follow him.  What was your favorite scene?
user1: I love how hard the toys work together to get back to Andy because they know how much he loves them
user1: What was yours?
user2: Tom Hanks and Woody allen were a great pairing.  Its what made the movie great
user1: Do you mean Tim Allen?
user2: Yes!  Duh!  I misspoke.  I didn't know it was a disney movie, I always thought pixar.
user2: Who is your favorite character?
user1: It is Pixar, but Pixar is under Walt Disney Studios. My favorite charcter would have to be Woody since Jessie is not talked about in the document
user2: Neither is Bo Peep, who is my fav, so I will default to Buzz
user1: Do you agree with the ratings of the movie?
user2: I do agree with the ratings, but I've never really thought of the word anthropomorphic when it comes to Toy Story...  
user2: i can't believe it came out in 1995!
user2: Feeling old
user1: Yeah me either haha I never really hear that word. And me too that is so crazy it is that old already
user1: What do you think of the key scenes?
user2: Pizza Planet, haha.  that vending machine was awesome
user2: Did you like the neighbor boy, Sid ?  Totally underrated character
user1: When I was a kid Sid scared me because of the creepy toys he put together
user1: He is very underrated because he is an important character, but since he was the antagonist he was not my favorite
user2: comic relief in Buzz realizing he is not a Space Ranger...  hahaha
user1: Yeah that is funny
user2: I dont remember the part about the puppy?!?!?!?
user1: What do you think when Andy gets a new puppy? 
user1: Oh hahaha you don't??
user2: I will have to watch it again.  Its my favorite movie mostly because i know every line due to my little brother.
user2: And I still do not remember the puppy!
user1: It is a good movie to watch over again
user2: Its very creative. 
user1: Do you like other Pixar movies too?
user2: yes, they are very brilliant
user1: Yeah I think so too!
user1: It was nice talking to you about Toy Story! Have a great night

conversation:
user1: Hi! I love watching the movie "Toy Story!" Have you seen it?
user2: I have, I didn’t realize it came out in 1995. Doesn’t seem that long ago. Have you seen it?
user1: Yeah I remember seeing it in the theater way back then. Can't believe it's been over 20 years!
user2: Did you know it was the first Pixar film?
user1: Yes I remember hearing about that. And how amazing the animation was at the time
user2: Definitely didn’t realize Don Rickles was Mr. Potatohead.
user1: No I don't think I knew that myself. I know all about Tim Allen and Tom Hanks though.
user1: lol the obvious stars I guess
user2: And it actually got 100% on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: Really it scored that high? I guess there must be a lot of nostalgia out there.
user2: It must be from the “razzle-dazzle technique” 😂
user1: I suppose so. It certainly was impressive at the time
user2: I didn’t realize that people consider it “a work of genius”.
user1: Well I think that hard to do with the uniqueness of the CGI at the time. I don't think the script itself is anything too special.
user2: Special enough to tickle adults it seems.
user2: I forget why they got lost.
user1: Yes it did do that. And now people who were kids back then are adults who still love it.
user2: That time they all went to Pizza Planet was classic.
user1: It's kind of complicated but Woody ends up getting abducted by Sid and Buzz goes to try to rescue him when Andy and family move out.
user1: Yeah that's what basically started the whole chain of the toys getting lost.
user2: Such a comedic adventure.
user1: It truly was. It's a good message about true friendship as well.
user2: I’m glad Buzz and Woody went from not getting along to becoming best friends.
user2: Who names their dog Scud?
user1: Yeah it showed a lot of growth on their parts. Not something you expect from toys.
user1: Bullies, I guess.
user2: There is a great seen where they are chasing the moving truck while on the RC car.
user1: Yes! I remember that! I certainly was rooting for them.
user2: I think that’s where the friendship blooms.
user2: Buzz saves the day with his wings!
user1: Hmm that's a good point. Buzz did finally show Woody that he can be useful as well.

conversation:
user2: Hey there
user1: Good morning how are you?
user2: Great!
user2: Want to talk about Toy Story, the movie?
user1: Sure, we just watched it. Love it!! Did you like it?
user2: Absolutely
user2: It's John Lasseter's masterclass in computer animation
user2: Basically put Pixar on the map
user1: Oh for sure, I love most movies Pixar!!
user2: Hard to believe Toy Story is already 23 years old!!!
user1: I have to agree with the critics & ratings.. I'd rate it high as well
user2: I remember when it came out like it was yesterday
user2: Yes, 100% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: You don't see that too often!!!
user1: Wow I didn't realize how long ago it was made
user1: Its a whole new kind of story for the time it was made, very imaginative.. toys that are not actually lifeless
user2: Even the humans are depicted well in this animated film!
user2: Andy is a classic 
user2: Lots of kids could relate to him
user1: Oh yeah the characters are done very well. I love all of the toys too. Woody and Mr. Potato Head may be my favorite
user2: I like Slinky Dog!
user2: And of course Buzz Lightyear
user2: Love that he thinks he's a real space ranger :-)
user1: I have to admit I didn't like Buzz when he first arrived as the surprise gift.
user1: He seems like a show off at first lol
user2: Right, his arrogance and ignorance gets them stuck in a crane game
user2: And that's when the supervillain Sid enters the picture!!!
user1: Sid is very interesting lol, and a bit scary for a kid!!
user2: Haha agreed
user2: I also love Pizza Planet
user1: I liked the crane scene though, all of the aliens
user2: classic part of childhood memories
user2: Haha right. And then Sid's dog!!
user2: So much action and tension in that whole scene
user1: Thought Scud was gonna gobble them up
user2: Love how it comes full circle with Andy getting a pup
user2: Woody saves the day, of course
user1: The new puppy definitely sets the stage for another Toy Story movie ;)
user2: Haha right
user2: Wonder if they'll all do as well on Metacritic
user2: 95/100 wow
user1: I actually haven't seen the others, I usually  prefer the first of a series
user1: I love that it has Tom hanks and tim allen

conversation:
user2: Hello!!!
user2: Is anyone there?
user1: Yes i'm here

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: it has been a while since  I have viewed this movie. But I remember that it was good.
user1: Do you think this film would have the same reviews today?
user1: I did not know that Steve Jobs was involved in this film.
user2: I didn't know that either. I think the reviews would still be as high today. Toy story was a classic
user1: But as perfect as this ? almost 100%.
user2: I think it has a unique story line that hasn't really been explored by any other movies in the way before or since
user1: Yeah, you may have a point,  but you don't think that being the first computer-animated film did give the film a boost with the critics ?
user2: I also think the fact that Woody's in it gives it a nostalgic feel for the older audience
user1: He was a great character, Tom Hanks did give him a lot of personality.
user2: That's true, it did have quite a bit of help with the critics for being first of it's kind
user2: He did, he did a great job voice acting, and so did Tim Allen
user2: I like how their characters started out at rivals but became friends as the film went on
user1: It did give a twist to film, a twist that we don't see often in children movies.
user2: I can'
user2: *i can't believe it's been over 20 years since it came out
user1: It had a great introduction, I like how the everything falls in places, 
user1: How seamlessly they introduce us to a world where toys can talk to each other. 
user2: Definitely, and how some of the toys believe they really are something based on the toy that they are
user2: Like how Buzz was convinced he was a space ranger
user1: That is the charm of the film, it makes them even more human.
user1: In comparison, the real humans humans in the movie seem one dimensional, they are less deep than the toys.
user2: Yes, they definitely made the toys more interesting than the humans as a twist compared to other movies
user2: I think the pizza planet scene was one of my favorites
user2: It reminded me of someplace similar that I went to as a child
user1: We did not have these in my childhood. the film has great action scenes
user1: I like on how the film is constructed, there is not superfluous scene.
user2: Yeah definitely, it has some great suspense but not too intense so little one's can enjoy it too
user1: it is not overly suspenseful, but there is always something happening. 
user1: This was my favorite scene, a lot of action.
user2: Yeah the ending was really good
user2: I loved the toys reactions to finding out Andy got a puppy for CHristmas
user1: It was a great ending.
user1: What did you liked the most about the movie ?
user2: Who was your favorite toy?
user2: I think Mr. Potato Head was my favorite
user1: I like Mr. Potatoe he was funny. 
user1: I liked on how the integrate the real toy as a comedic device.
user2: I liked the development of all the main characters, they all evolved by the end of the movie
user1: That is my favorite part, there is a lot of character development in the movie.
user1: Do you intend to see the movie again ?
user2: They set it up nicely to have sequels 
user2: I might now that I've talked about it so much
user1: Me too
user2: My son likes the movie so maybe I'll have to pop it in for a movie night
user1: Thanks for the conversation, have a noce day. 

conversation:
user2: hi

user1: It does.  One of the best created ones out there.
user2: yes it is 
user1: Who is your favorite character?
user2: its pixar animation studios for walt disney picture
user2: it was first feature length computer animated film 
user2: i love all movies of pixar studios
user1: I love how it's so "real" and pertains to every childs life with their toys.  
user2: that cowboy doll is my favorite character
user2: and the voice of tom hanks looks perfect on him
user1: Ah Jessie..  
user1: Yes.  I meant Woody...lol
user1:  I love how Buzz thinks he's real.
user2: i love the concept of movie when all toys gets lifeless in the presence of human 
user2: and then get real in their absence 
user1: I like how they are friends.
user1: And in real life I like how the toys are happy none of them were replaced (after Andy's party)
user2: yes yes 
user2: Buzz impresses the other toys 
user2: and andy begins to favor hi
user1: I used to believe my toys were real in the manner that they could feel, so I related well to the concept of this movie.
user2: it was natural for woody to feel insecure 
user1: Yeah, Buzz was definitely impressing the other toys with his features.
user2: but it was an accident when woody attempts to trap the buzz behind a desk 
user1: And then Woody later says at Christmas that they could get a new toy worse than Buzz...lol
user2: but ends up  knocking him out a window
user1: And then Woody gets upset :(
user2: but i love then all were against woody but andy still choose the woody
user1: Yep, the go to Toy :)
user2: and buzz still thinks he is a real space ranger
user2: lol
user1: lol yep poor Buzz LOL
user1: I love when they flew into the car, brought tears to my eyes.

user1: Hi there! 
user2: Hey! I remember watching Toy Story as a kid but never really thought about the voice actors. Have you seen ever seen this movie before? 
user2: I definitely agree with the ratings. I think what makes this movie even more amazing is that it got such a high rating from various reviewers as the first feature-length animated film. 

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hey there.. got a movie to recommend??
user1: Yes I do it happens to be one of my favorite series! I consider it revolutionary
user2: Really??  What's it called??
user1: Toy Story! It was like the first of its kind of those really nice cartoons
user2: Sounds like a kid's movie.  What is it about??
user1: Its about a kid who has a bunch of favorite toys, and how they interact with each other when the kid is not there
user2: interact with each other??  what do you mean??
user2: are the toys alive??
user1: They talk and get into adventures. They are only alive amongst themselves. 
user2: Oohhh.. how is it the first of it's kind??
user1: The leader of the toys is Woody a Cowboy
user2: who stars in it??
user1: Well it is the first of the Dreamworks/Disney computer animated movies
user1: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen are some of the bigger named stars and the move is a real treat
user2: Oh, they make good movies.  
user2: You said series, how many movies did they make??
user1: yea it pretty much started an era of those types of movies
user1: they made 3 of them along with some mini movies
user2: I might check out it out.  Is it on dvd??

user1: It came out in 1995 and they also have a large line of toys too from the movie
user2: I'll look for it.
user1: well thanks for chatting about the movie!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello

conversation:
user1: Hello.  Did you see Toy Story when it came out in 1995?
user2: Yes I did I loved the movie
user1: So did I.  A lot of other people did too.  It has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: What genre was this movie?
user1: Toy Story was an animated adventure comedy.  Did you know Woody the cowboy doll was voiced by Tom Hanks?
user2: Yes I did, Did you know Tim Allen Played Buzz Lightyear.
user1: Yes, I did.  I really liked the way that they portrayed the competition between Buzz Lightyear and Woody for their owner Andy's affection.
user2: I agree with that. they knew how to appeal to a kid's heart. Did you know that pixar animation studios worked on the film with walt disney?
user1: I remember hearing about that.  I really liked Randy Newman's music in the movie, how about you?
user2: I loved a Friend In need. That was my favorite song
user1: That was a great song and the scene was really touching.  I liked the use at the end of the movie showing how Woody and Buzz had become friends.
user2: Me too I liked in the beginning of the movie The toys are doesn't relaize his birthday has been moved up a week. and shortly after buzz is introduced
user1: I thought the idea of toys being alive but only when humans aren't present was really clever.
user2: Yes it was very clever, I also attribute the success of the movie to John Lasseter's directing style. He did a great job making all the characters come together.
user1: I agree.  I also think that Tim Allen's portrayal of Buzz Lightyear as a toy who thought he was an actual space ranger was wonderful.  The scene where Buzz realizes that he is a toy has always made me feel very strongly.
user2: Yes It made me feel a deep connection as well. Did you know one of the executive producers was Steve Jobs?
user1: No, I didn't realize that.  Do you remember when Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out of the window and none of the other toys believed that it was an accident?
user2: Yes, I do I felt sad in that moment and wanted them to believe woody. Do you remember when woody get's stuck in the arcade game and Sid retrevies him?
user1: I was always afraid of Andy's neighbor Sid.  He was a scary kid.
user2: Yes he was. Everything works out in the end though. What did you think about when Andy took woody instead of buzz. I was a little bit sad but I know they become friends in the end.
user1: When I was a kid, I remember thinking that it was a little mean of Andy to forget about Buzz and take Woody.  After all, they were going to Pizza Planet.  That would be perfect for Buzz Lightyear.  Do your remeber how excited Buzz was to see all of the space games at that restaurant?
user2: Yes I do remember and he hitches a ride with a few other toys and go to the restaurant with Andy, stowed away. 
user1: Wasn't it exciting when Woody and Buzz were trying to get into the moving truck with the rest of Andy's toys?
user2: Yes it was I remember that know! they eventually made it to the truck but they thought that woddy was trying to get rid of rc but eventually they realize the mistake. 
user2: That was a little sad
user1: Oh yes, I forgot that the toys thought Woody was trying to get rid of RC.  I thought it was really neat when Woody lit the rocket on Buzz's back to catch up to the truck after RC's battery died.
user2: That was really inventive thinking on Woody's part. I also Like at the end on Christmas day they have a mission to see what new toys there might be but after discovering that it is a puppy they share a smile
user1: I did like that scene, it was a nice callback to Sarge and the other toy soldiers doing reconnaissance like they did at Andy's birthday party.
user2: It was just like Andy's birthday party. My favorite toy story characters are Buzz and Woody, but I also have a soft spot for Rex and the other toys.

user2: Pixar Animation Studios
user1: How was it critically received?
user2: razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look
user1: I'm sorry. I don't understand. Was the film received well by critics?
user1: In other words, did critics like the film?
user2: yes  I tell you what the critics say....It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatest children's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids
user1: Did the film win any awards?
user2: NO
user1: Do you know what the Rotten Tomatoes score was for the film?
user2: 100% and average: 9/10

user1: Hello, nice talking to you.
user2: Hello how are you?
user1: Fine and you?
user2: Fine thank you! Have you seen this little animated feature 
user2: Called Toy Story 
user1: No I didn't but I like animations. Is it nice?
user2: I don’t like to hype things up but Toy Story changed the game for animated features 
user1: Oh really. What is it about?
user2: It’s about these toys that come to life and the main toy woody, a cowboy doll, is getting replaced by the new toy Buzz Lightyear
user1: Interesting. So they toys come to life and talk to people naturally?
user2: No their one rule is that they can’t physically talk to humans.
user2: With a few exceptions of course 
user1: Understood. And what is your preferred character?
user2: Woody the main character has to be my favorite. He’s the leader of all the toys but he has his sassy mean moments which
user2: Make him ironiclly human
user1: I am still deciding to watch it or not. What is the history about?
user2: It came out in 1995 as Disney’s Pixar for film and first CGI film ever! It’s a landmark for the studio and made CGI the common style of the latest animated features to this day! The story is excellent for adults and children and it brings so many nostalgic memories of childhood that anyone can relate to
user2: It has a 100% on rotten tomatoes which is one rating I do agree with 
user1: And does it have a lot of adventure?
user2: Oh definitely! Since they are toys the typical world to us are very dangerous for them. Just going down 
user2: The stairs for them is a journey 
user1: And is there a kind of enemy on the movie?
user2: Of definitely! A rebel kids that likes to experiment with toys gets a hold of the toys. Some of the toys themselves have their cruel moments.
user1: It seems really interesting. And what is your preferred scene?
user2: When Buzz Lightyear finds out he’s a toy. Throughout the movie he thinks he an actual space employer and reality kicks in eventually 
user1: It seems funny. And without telling the end of the history, is it surprising?
user2: Yes and no! Everything about this film flows so well! It’s perfect story telling with the right amount of emotions 
user1: Really nice, and who is Woody's owner?
user2: Andy! A young boy. It’s cute because he writes his name on the bottom of each characters foot to show that they belong to him 
user1: That seems nice. And which is the funniest character?
user2: Hmmmm! So many have great moments! Woody is funny because he’s so sassy but Buzz is so serious it’s
user2: hilariois 
user1: Great to know. What else should I know to decide watching it or not?
user2: That’s its just amazing!
user1: Ok, nice talking to you. Bye

conversation:
user2: Have you ever seen the movie Toy Story?
user1: yes!
user2: It is a great movie, about toys that come to life when people aren't present
user1: I remember it having alot of life lessons about friendship
user2: Exactly. I love how Woody and Buzz are rivals in the beginning and then turn out to be friends in the end
user1: what was the little kids name again?
user2: Andy
user1: oh right, it was written on the bottom of their shoes right?
user2: He sure did love them. I loved how real they acted
user2: It was
user1: what happened in the plot? did the toys get lost?
user2: The family was preparing to move, so they had to have Andy's birthday party a week early
user2: That's when he got Buzz as a birthday gift
user1: oh and Buzz didnt realize he was a toy?
user1: Did  you like the movie?
user2: Yes! It was so funny!
user1: Was it sad at all? Or just funny??
user2: I remember when Buzz was determined to prove he wasn't just a toy and jumps off the landing of the stairs, to show he can fly.
user2: That was pretty sad to me. 
user1: was it a long movie?
user2: I can't remember
user2: Can you believe it was released in 1995? I can't believe it was that long ago
user2: I think I'm going to watch it again this week
user2: Do you like animation movies?

conversation:
user1: The movie is Toy Story,  A classic by Pixar from 1995.
user1: It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100%.
user2: Sounds interesting and intriguing to watch due to ratings. Whats it about?
user1: It is a buddy comeday adventure film about the relationship between toys are alive and pretend to be lifeless when people are around.
user1: comedy*
user2: Toys come alive...cool. Is it a live action/CGI film or animation/cartoon?
user1: It is CGI,  it was the first feature-length animated film as well as Pixar's first feature film.
user2: Sounds great. As its an animated film I'm guessing its family friendly? Whats the age rating?
user1: oh computer animated film
user1: It is a children's film.
user1: however critics have said "...at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids."
user2: So it must have underlining comedy and meaning hidden to adults? That's amusing.
user2: Who stars or are the main voices in the film?
user1: Woody,  the cowboy,  is voiced by Tom Hanks and Buzz Lightyear, the astronaut, is voiced by Tim Allen
user2: A big Hollywood star and a comedic actor. Good line up. How long is the film?
user1: I am not sure about that but critics agree with your previous statement saying it is one of the best voiced animated features in memory
user2: Its sounding better and better. Is it a stand alone film or does it have a sequel or part of a franchise?
user1: You might be able to find by searching online,  I do know that the film featured music by Randy Newman which was quite memorable.
user2: Music by Randy Newman, is he known for any other features or music in films?
user1: That would be likely be something you could find with a google search I'm not sure...  The movie really is a fun experience,  everyone should see it.  How many movies have an A from Cinemascore like Toy Story does?
user2: True. Did the film win any other awards or recognition?
user1: It is rated 95/100 on Metacritic.
user2: Scores very high sounds awesome. Did it get any negative points or bad press?
user1: I am not sure about that,  in searching for reviews you could likely sort only the bad reviews if you wanted to.  I have only seen several critical responses praising it including one saying "... razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look"
user2: Cool. Being a comedy film. Is the comedy slapstick, laugh out loud funny, observation humor etc?
user1: I am not sure about those categories but it is definitely a buddy comedy that touches a number of other emotions throughout the adventures the toys experience.
user2: Emotions....are there scary or sad parts?
user1: The one toy, Woody, is jealous of the attention the new toy, Buzz, recieves.  His jealous actions set off a chain of events that build up a relationship between the two.
user2: Is there any notable highlights in the film that are worth mentioning to inform my decision?
user1: In addition to the toys that were mentioned there were some real world toys such as Mr. Potato Head in the movie which I think helped to connect to the world.
user2: haha awesome what other types of toys are in the movie?
user1: Well Woody is an old pull string toy cowboy.  There is Bo Peep the shepherdess doll.  Rex The Dinosaur, A whole bunch of green army men led by "Sarge"
user1: They use an RC car,  meet green squeeky toy aliens
user1: there is even a slinky dog!
user1: I really think you would enjoy it
user2: Ok This film sounds great.

user1: I just watched it again with my grandkids,they loved it
user2: The idea that they come to life when humans are not around.
user1: Love it
user2: Of course it has to be a Pixar movie.  
user1: How about Steve jobs was the executive producer 
user1: I didn’t know that until right now 
user2: Really! 
user2: See what you find out by reading the review
user1: Like when buzz realized he was a toy
user2: Yep so funny
user1: Yes,reading reviews are helpful as well as finding these things out
user1: Not a big Tim Allen fan but his voice was perfect for this 
user2: Watching the movie over again was a high e
user1: I’ll probably watch a few more times at least 
user1: How about rotten tomatoes 100%
user2: If you have kids around you will see it over and over.
user1: Absolutely

user1: Yes it does certainly 
user2: Toys are living in that film and a good job of the plot for toys
user1: Yea,everything about the movie was top notch
user1: An all time classic 
user2: Really should be if we have any say about it.
user1: Amazing how far movies have come
user2: yes, if that was the first animated toy movie and now look at the ones that are our.  
user1: Like every month it seems another one coming out
user2: They really did a good job pairing up actors and toys.  The voices are great and the toys get you believing them
user1: Perfectly matched up,I agree 
user2: Not that long ago when first came out.  
user1: No it wasn’t 
user2: Tom Hanks and Tim Allen stole the story
user2:  All  the cast of humans and toys are so well matched and believable.

user2: no. not yet 
user2: but the name it self 'toy story' sounds intresting
user1: It looks like it got a perfect review on rotten tomatoes and that’s probably pretty good. I think it’s hard to get out 100 on rotten tomatoes.
user2: yes true
user1:   Yeah did sound interesting
user2: i must watch it soon
user1:  It look like it came out 95 so it’s been out for quite some time 
user2: yea. even so i hopeit's nice
user1:  It looks like Tom Hanks plays woody the cowboy dolling it. 
user2: haha!  Don Rickles role was as potato head
user1:  That sounds like the perfect role for him 
user2: exactly
user1: It looks like the story is told through the eyes of the dolls or toys of a six-year-old.
user2: yea. and how Andy received an electronic toy space ranger action figure.
user1: Yeah that was Buzz light year he was played by Tim Allen
user2: hmm.. thats kul.
user1:  It’s like in with the new toys out with the old toys at least that’s what the old toys thought it first 
user2: would love to see how the toys pretended to be lifeless when humans were around.
user1:  That could be cool 
user2: yea
user1:  Were you given page with the information about the movie 
user2: yes. 
user2: you?
user1:  Yes  I did. Looks like this could also be considered a Christmas movie just for the fact of what happens on Christmas Day 
user2: it would be a nice movie for the children especially when they are on holidays.
user1:  It looks like the noodle toys kind of become friends. But it’s kind of clever home after the toys are introduced to each other it kind of gets ready to end with the child getting his own puppy. Kind a like life and growing up 
user1: New -noodle
user1:  It auto corrected me for some reason sorry about that 
user2: haha! it's okay got what you were saying.
user2: but andy made Woody to feel left out  when he started to favor Buzz

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: Hi, how are you?  I
user1: What movie is this? (:
user1: I'm good! how are you
user2: Toy Story, the first Pixar movie.
user1: Nice!
user2: I am a big fan of Pixar, are you?
user1: Yes I am
user1: However I haven't seen this movie
user1: It must be good if it's Pixar!
user2: Really, what Pixar movies have you seen?
user1: Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, etc.
user1: Did you like this movie?
user2: Yes, it's probably in the top five Pixar movies.
user2: Have you seen any of the Toy Story movies?  There are three.
user1: I have seen the most recent one
user1: Nice, I must watch it then
user2: I will warn you it is not as good as the most recent movie.  Toy Story 3 is the best.
user1: I see
user1: What reviews did it get, do you know?
user2: Do you have a favorite PIxar or Disney movie?
user1: The Incredibles
user1: I would like to know more about this story
user1: What happens in the plot?
user1: What**
user2: Well, it's pretty simple really.  Woody is Andy's favorite toy until he gets Buzz Lightyear for Christmas.
user1: Oh no
user2: Woody is jealous, and does something mean that causes Buzz and himself to get lost, 
user1: That sucks!
user1: Poor Woody
user2: Thereafter, they attempt to return to Andy's room, and have many difficulties getting there.
user2: Well, he has to learn to be the second favorite toy.  A toy serves the child.
user1: Do they get lost somewhere in the house
user1: or outside the house?
user2: They get lost mostly at the neighbor's house, who is very vicious towards his own toys.
user1: That sucks! So the toys are poorly taken care of I'm assuming? or broken?
user1: Do they become friends with the other toys
user2: Sid, the neighbor, likes to torture his toys (although to be fair, he thinks they're toys).  
user2: In order to escape, Woody breaks some of the rules of toys in order to frighten Sid. 
user1: Haha still seems like a red flag about the kid's personality
user1: Wait
user1: Toys have rules? haha like what?
user1: That's so interesting
user1: Do Woody and Buzz become friends at the end?
user2: They can't reveal that they are alive or have intelligence.  It's not clear why this is a rule.
user1: I see, that's kind of cool
user2: Yes, they become friends.
user1: Yay! I love happy endings

user2: Yes I think so.  It has a cast of popular actors also.
user1: I'm not familiar with the director though
user2: No, I'm not either.  One of the executive producers is Steve Jobs, surely that's not the same Steve Jobs from Apple?
user1: I like the critical response "....razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look'
user1: I don't know...it might be
user1: Tom Hanks is almost always funny
user2: I  agree.
user1: oh, and the screenplay is Joss Whedon. He did Firefly
user2: I knew that name sounded familiar.  I haven't seen that movie though,
user1: looks like a 'key scenes' has been added to our document?
user2: I guess that's what we're supposed to talk about next.
user2: But only the first scene where Buzz comes into the picture
user1: right.  I guess, maybe they'll be adding more key scenes?
user2: I love the little green army men in this scene.
user1: :) I think I've seen the movie, but I don't remember it real well
user2: I think this is where Mr. Potato Head is wishing for Mrs. Potato head
user2: I have a 3 year old so we watch it a lot
user1: makes sense
user2: Sid is a really mean character in this
user1: I just read the No. 1 key scene "In a world where..." in Don LaFontaine's voice
user2: As a kid this was one of my favorite movies.  I loved the thought of the toys being alive when we weren't looking
user1: well, you need someone to be the bad guy
user1: new up date!
user2: I didn't know Sid's dog was named Scud ha
user1: I'm going to name my next dog Scud! :)
user2: This is the final scene I think
user1: yeah.
user1: there was a book...Indians in the Cupboard? that also was about toys coming alive when you weren't looking
user2: I didn't remember them getting a puppy at the end
user1: I bet he didn't name it Scud
user2: Hahahahaha
user1: I didn't see the sequel, they probably mention it there
user2: Is this going to automatically exit?
user1: I believe so.

user1: Yes! It was. I feel like Tom Hanks did a very good job as Woody.
user2: Yes, and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear was awesome.
user1: I see that it received high rankings on Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and CinemaScore. I agree with those! I think it was a great movie.
user2: Yeah, it did well. I think it is a work of genius. It really made people understand what toys are all about.
user1: The critical response was also really positive. I think it started a whole new era for Pixar / Disney, and CG animation as a whole.
user2: Yeah, and the musical score by Randy Newman was really great too.
user1: I completely forgot about the music until you just mentioned it. :) It's quite iconic.
user2: Very much so!
user1: I never knew this, but according to the info I have here, it was executive-produced by Steve Jobs.
user2: Interesting, I'm not sure about that. But the director was John Lasseter.
user1: Yeah. I don't know if John went on to direct the following Toy Story movies, but he did an incredible job with this one.
user2: He really did. Did you know that Andy, to boy who owns the toys, last name was Davis?
user1: Hah! I didn't. That's cool.
user2: It was such a great plot point that Buzz really thought he was a space ranger.
user1: I wonder if they directly worked with kids to get ideas of how children would see toys and the world around them from that perspective?
user2: Don't know about that, could have been. But it does show real world experiences like how Woody started to feel lonely when the other toys took a liking to Buzz.
user1: That's true. Man, what a good movie.
user1: I'm remembering all of the secondary characters now, too. I really liked Mr. Potato Head and Rex.
user2: Yeah. And what a great bad guy Sid was!
user1: He really typified the sort of sociopathic, child bully character.
user2: I think it is true what the Critics say that it is a hallmark of the greatest child movies of all time.
user1: Absolutely. I watched it as a child and it stuck with me for so long.
user2: The chase at the end where they are trying to get onto the moving truck! So exciting!
user1: I had forgotten about that. Buzz "flies" correctly for the first time.
user2: Any Woody is using the AC car to save Buzz but the other toys think he is trying to hurt AC, so funny.
user1: I guess this is in the back of my head somewhere, but it was the first feature-length CG film.
user2: Oh really? Hard to believe it was made all the way back in 1995.
user1: Have a good day!
user2: bye

user2: The cowboy was good.
user2: Do you know there was a sequel?

user2: Well, Buzz threatened his stability
user1: That is an interesting storyline isnt it?

user2: The cast consisted of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the lead roles
user1: Sounds familiar.  I don't thing I saw it.  Was it a comedy?

user1: What was the name of the moview?
user2: Toy Story
user1: Wow - Woody and co. huh?
user2: yeah its a great time
user1: Yeah I saw it way back when .  What was the little girls name?
user2: I honestly cant remember, are you referring to the sister?
user1: That's okay.  What was the name of the space guy - you know - TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!
user2: Buzz Lightyear
user1: HAHAHA.  It's starting to come back now. Is that the one were Woody was given away?
user2: yeah he has to get out of a lot of trouble
user1: Hmmmm didn't he get run over in that film or almost run over?
user2: they almost do, but they hang on to the back of the garbage truck
user1: It's like numbing my mind to remeber some of the other characters.  Did they go into  a toy store in that movie?
user2: no that was the second one
user1: Oh yeah.  The first one was when the boy lost him or left him behind?
user2: yeah andy left him
user1: There was a horse also yes?
user2: yes but that was in the second one also
user1: Sheesh!!!   Still trying to remember how it ended.  Andy and woody got back together right?
user2: oh yeah of course they did, in the end everyone ended up alright 
user1: All's well that ends well.  I guess maybe I'll try to see the movie again one day.  Not sure.
user2: I would because even though its targeted for kids I think its really for all ages.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Good Morning! The movie we will be discussing today is Toy Story have you seen it
user1: I have seen Toy Story but it's been over 10 or 15 years since I've seen it. I was a little boy
user2: Yea Toy Story came out as well when I was a kid. It came out in 95 I had to be no more than 5 or 6
user1: I feel like it's become as much a part of popular culture as a movie
user2: Definitely the concept of the film is great, showcase the life of dolls and action figures when the kids and parents are not watching. Thats genius
user2: Have you seen Sausage Party with Seth Rogen it has kinda the same concept just with food?
user1: yeah I love the characters they made for the toys. A lot of them are in popular culture like I was saying
user1: Sausage Party was pretty good! I didn't like the religious inferences but there were so many funny parts in it
user1: Toy Story is definitely more of a kid's movie
user2: Yea Buzz, Woody are definitely household names. I remember playing the game on PC when it came out. Toy Story is a classic and the sequels are great. I heard the 4th movie is in production
user1: one of the most popular phrases I've heard is "To infinity and Beyond!" 
user2: Lmao we used to say that randomly in class all the time. My favorite was "There's a Snake in My Boat"
user1: I think I played it on Nintendo 64 or it may have even been an earlier system
user2: *Boot
user1: lol yeah and "You've got a friend in me"
user1: surely they're running out of Toy Story ideas?
user2: Idk the 3rd one was pretty good, but your right though how many sequels are they gonna do. 
user2: Mr. Potato Head was pretty funny as well, and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog is classic
user1: well nowadays it seems like the best stuff Hollywood can come up with is remakes and sequels
user1: I used to have a Mr. Potato Head toy and I never even knew that Jim Varney did Slinky Dog!
user2: Yea I hated the Jumanji reboot, and the Power Rangers was trashed. Maybe im getting too old lol
user2: Tom Hanks solidified his career with Woody and Forrest Gump
user1: I previewed the Jumanji reboot but it didn't look good enough to watch all the way through
user1: I thought Power Rangers was pretty good but again mostly because of the nods to the older series...I feel like that's how Toy Story is probably going to work out
user1: Tom Hanks probably carried Toy Story quite a bit
user2: yea thank god for streaming movies I would have been mad If I had spent my money on the movie
user2: Yea he did, Buzz was rather annoying but it was heartbreaking once Buzz realized he was just a toy
user2: Falling with Style
user1: I actually went and saw Power Rangers at a bargain theater nearby for 3$ lol
user1: who voiced Buzz Lightyear again? he was someone famous like Tom Hanks
user2: Woody Allen voiced Buzz, and 3 dollar for a movie isnt bad. I paid 9 bucks to see Black Panther a few weeks back
user2: The document says it has a rotten tomatoes score of 100% thats amazing
user1: oh right and nope they just get the movies a few weeks after the major theaters started running them
user1: I don't see a lot of those...it's the genius originality Hollywood used to put into old movies for sure
user2: Yea we had a discount theater near me but they closed down a few years back. 

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello

user1: Nice, thats probably around the same time i saw it
user1: team buzz, is that even a question
user2: some people are team woody, just eant to make sure we are on the same team.
user2: Do you think andy was wrong for neglecting woody when he got buzz?
user1: lol i like your mindset
user1: and not really because he is just a kid
user1: he knows no better
user2: thats true. I felt bad for woody, if toys had emotions that is.
user1: i hear ya, it is sad but thats how we are as kids
user2: Who was a more funny character, rex or potato head?
user1: potato head, he was an awesome character 
user2: i liked rex, he was a slow funny character.
user2: who was your favorite secondary charcater?

conversation:
user2: I would agree with the critics scores; Toy Story was a great movie.
user1: Me too, it was a great movie.
user2: I really enjoyed the dialogue between Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.  I thought they were cast very well.  What did you think?

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi 
user1: what movie do u have
user2: Toy Story is the first movie produced by Pixar. It's about an anthrophomorphic toys
user2: They pretend to be lifeless whenever humansare present. The fim focuses on the relationship between an old fashioned toy, Woody, and an astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear
user2: It has purity that deals with the freedom of imagination, a major point of many of the best children films
user2: It focuses a lot on the different personalities of Buzz and Woody. Buzz has a big ego
user1: that sounds very good
user1: who plays the main characters
user2: Tom Hanks plays Woody. Tim Allen plays Buzz Lightyear. We also have Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, and Wallace Shawn as Rex
user1: when did the movie come out?
user2: It came out in 1995
user1: how were the reviews?
user2: The reviews were pretty good. On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 100 percent with an average of 9/10. The CinemaScore is an A
user2: One of my favorite scenes is when Andy receives a surprise gift and it's Buzz Lightyear, this sets the action in motion
user2: It also creates the dynamic between Buzz and Woody that will be the main plot and conflict through the movie
user2: Do you generally watch films with good ratings?
user1: yea i do
user1: they did pretty well
user1: how does andy interact with the toys
user2: Andy does not interact with the living toys. He only knows them when not animated.
user1: oh ok
user1: whats the conflict and resolution in this movie
user2: Well one of the key scenes that shows the major conflict is when Buzz impresses the oother toys with various features. This is one reason why Andy starts to favor him, which makes Woody feel left out
user2: At one point, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out a window, and the other toys believe he did it out of jealousy. They take revenge and leave Woody at Pizza Planet
user1: wow i guess buzz impresses not only toys but humans
user1: wow toys can be vicious
user2: Yes, they can be
user2: However, there is an upside. Buzz annd Woody become a duo as they fight off things like sid and his dog
user1: and sid and his dog are supposed to be evil
user1: so the toys learn to work together?
user2: Sid is mischievous
user2: And yes toys can learn to work together
user1: do the other toys forgive woody
user2: Once they see Woody and Buzz working together on the RC, they try to help them in the car

user2: Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy adventure film produced byPixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The directorial debut of John Lasseter, ToyStory was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced byPixar. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless wheneverhumans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashionedpullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure(voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner,to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a newhome. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and AlecSokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film featuresmusic by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.
user1: Oh, interesting that Joss whedon was a writer on it
user2: Yeah he does a lot of punch-ups
user2: Here's a key scene
user2: In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present,a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy'sbirthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, arepreparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-stringcowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep theshepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog,into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report theresults to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to endwith none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – anelectronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actualspace ranger.
user1: Uh oh that actually sounds kinda sad
user1: But he must not really replace anyone since he becomes bff with Woody
user2: Yeah
user2: another scene
user2: Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him,making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his motherallows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzzbehind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toysrebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they canexact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the familystops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well, and fight, only tofind the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant bystowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger,despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game,where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.
user1: Sid Phillips must be good at crane games
user1: What happens after they get out of the crane game?
user1: Does Sid know they're Andy's toys?
user1: Did Sid go to Andy's party?
user1: I mean are they friends or enemies?
user2: Oh yes
user2: They all become friends
user1: How lovely!
user2: The toys reveal their real nature to Sid and scare him, scaring him for life
user1:  pretty funny
user2: shows him for playing with inanimate toys in a creative way
user2: more key scenes
user2: The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and giveschase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing himwith Andy's RC car, but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well, attack andtoss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continueafter the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize theirmistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted,stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into thetruck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocketbefore it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy.On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissancemission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worsethan Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile
user2: critical response
user2: ● "... razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look"● "Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, ToyStory is one of the best voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... makingtheir presences strongly felt."● "It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatestchildren's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times,will tickle adults even more than it does kids."● "a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to theirown character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, whenBuzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircaseand the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massiveego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period."
user2: and there's 2 sequels. Toy Story 3 is my favorite one
user1: That toy space man had real rockets?
user1: Also, scud is a great dog name
user2: naw they tie a firework to him

conversation:
user1: Hi, there! Seen any good movies lately?
user2: Hi, how are you? :)
user2: I have seen Toy Story, do you know this film?
user1: Fine! Thanks! I've not seen Toy Story! Is it worth checking out?
user2: Yes, of course!
user1: Who made the movie?
user2: it's computer-animated comedy produced by Pixar
user1: Oh, they always do a good job! Anybody I might know do the voices?
user2: for example Tom Hanks as Woody (a pull-string cowboy doll)
user1: I like Tom Hanks! What's the general plotline?
user2: It is a world where toys are living things
user2: but toys pretend to be lifeless when humans are present
user2: very nice story :)
user1: Ha Ha ha! Can't blame 'em. We'd probably put 'em to work! Where does it get sticky?
user2: the action start when Andy received  an electronic toy space ranger named Buzz
user1: Is Andy a human then? Who voices Buzz?
user2: yes, Andy is a six-year-old boy
user2: Tim Allen
user1: Oh, I like Tim Allen, too! Does Andy catch Buzz in action, then?
user2: I don't remember...
user1: Ha!  What else can you tell me about the plot that gets the action going?
user2: ok, but it's better to see this film :)
user2: Buzz, because it is a new toy, impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, and Andy's oldtoy - Woody - feel left out
user1: Ah, the cowboy gets a bit jealous. What happens next?
user2: Woody attempts to trap Buzz but accidentally knocked him out of a window
user2: and the other toys rebel against Woody...
user1: Throws him out the window! Now, that's severe! How is the rebellion depoloyed - or what other comeuppance or revelation of understanding occurs?
user2: to be honest, I am not a good reviewer...
user1: Don't you have the document? I think you're just supposed to provide info from the document, using the new stuff that appears every little while.
user2: yes :) 
user1: So what else can you tell me about the movie?
user2: at the end... on Christmas Day, Woody and Buzz stage reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals...
user1: Ah, looking to see where they come from?
user2: and they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy...
user1: Ooooh, now that's a happy gift! What do they think about that? About it not being a toy?
user2: I am not sure what they think but  they 'share a worried smile'...
user1: Well, it sounds good! I'll have to check it out! Thanks so much, and have a great day!
user2: Thanks, have a great day! 

conversation:
user2: This movie is about toys that pretend not to be alive when people are around.
user2: Have you seen a movie like this?
user1: The two main characters are toys of different eras. Woody is an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll, while Buzz is a state if the art astronaut toy representing the progression of technology while Woody represents more old fashioned analog technologies.  Eventually the two become friends and the message is old an new can work together to make something even better than either of them are on their own. 
user2: Yes.  Did you enjoy this movie?
user1: I did.  Of course, Disney Pixar are experts at pulling on everyone's heart strings. 
user1: Did you enjoy the movie?
user2: It was a movie that did that.  I really like movies like this. They are really good for children and adults.
user1: Exactly. I loved this movie when I was little, and still, love it when I am now an adult. 
user2: I do too.  It is a classic movie that will stand the test of time.
user1: Absolutely. The animation is now considered a little outdated and new movies are better aesthetically,but when it comes down to it, nothing will ever surpass the popularity of the classic Disney movies. 
user1: I've never met someone who didn't like toy story. 
user2: I agree.  They have a way with creating amazing characters.  Just look at Woody and how he and Buzz become friends.
user1: Yes it is a classic story model, of the rivals that eventually become the best of friends, but Disney has a way of making it feel fresh and new, and not overdone. 
user2: I agree.  I also think they pick good voices for their characters.  Just like they picked Tom Hanks for Woody.
user1: Yes, those two are like America's dads. They have very trustworthy voices. 
user2: I also think that the secondary characters like Mr. Potato Head and Slinky Dog really add to the enjoyment of the movie.  They give you the comic relief that is needed to make this movie fun and enjoyable.
user1: Comic relief is very important, but it is a bad movie that relies solely on comedic moments to carry the storyline.  Toy story doesn't do that. 
user2: No.  It takes the kid in all of us through a ride toward two characters friendship.  I agree with you that they made that common story plot and made it fresh.  It is amazing how creators can make such amazing ways to convey themes like this.
user1: It is clear that most people agree on that, based on it's ratings. 100%, 9/10, and 95/100. Everyone enjoys this movie. 
user2: Yes.  I think I that when they describe scenes like when Woody gets upset and thinks that Buzz is becoming the favorite toy, people can see it in their heads.  They can see Woody trying to get Buzz stuck behind the desk.
user1: Exactly. Envy and jealousy are very human emotions. Ones that viewers can really relate to. It is clear that woody just doesn't want to be replaced and that is clear from the very beginning when all the toys set up a recon operation at the birthday party to ensure that the presents he receives don't replace them. 
user2: I think that it is a novial idea to have Buzz think he is a real space ranger.  It gives the story depth that other plots of this type don't have because he is unknowingly making the other toys like him.
user1: It makes me wonder if the other toys thought they were real cowboys, dinosaurs, and potatoes when they first came out of the box. But Buzz sticking to his guns and refusing to break character or acknowledge that he is not a space ranger is what makes him so endearing. 
user2: I think I would like to think that they all thought they were real cowboys, etc.  It gives it a more dynamic thought process to it.  
user1: I do too. Also the scene towards the end of the movie where Woody is insisting that Buzz can't fly and Buzz says "we're not flying were falling with style" implies that he finally realizes that he isn't a space ranger he is a toy.  And maybe all toys go through this adjustment process. 
user2: Yeah.  I also am thinking about the scene at the end of the movie where they find go recon Andy's gifts at Christmas.  They give each other worried smiles when they see it's a puppy.  I would like them to be thinking about how to incorporate this pooch into the mix of toys.
user1: Its the same worried look that woody had at the beginning of the movie when Buzz was unwrapped, but now he has someone to share it with, who feels the same way. 
user2: It is now that I think about it.  Completely the same look.  
user2: Did you watch more Pixar movies because of your enjoyment with this movie?
user1: Exactly the same look. They are both dismayed but they eventually come around to the dog, as we see in the second movie.  yes, I love Disney and Pixar movies and I remember seeing Toy story when I was very little and have been watching ever since. 
user2: Well, thank you for a lovely conversation about this movie.  It has been very enjoyable talking to you.

user2: I'm not surprised about that. Most Disney movies are good. What was the Rotten Tomatoes rating?
user1: John Lasseter was the director. and it was 100% rating 9/10
user1: The cinemascore was an A also. 
user2: Wow...that's terrific. It must be an excellent movie. What else happens in the story?
user1: Andy and his mom are going for pizza and she lets him bring one toy and woody thinks hes going to pick buzz so they trap him and accidently knock him out a window and the other toys get very upset
user2: That's funny.
user2: So who did Andy pick?
user1: andy  takes woody instead and leaves,and they stop to get gas and woody sees buzz hitched a ride and they have a fight
user2: That's really funny. Are the humans oblivious to all of this?
user1: yes, they are not part of the toys coming to life.
user1: They also have a very mean neighbor who keeps trying to get ahold of either buzz or woody and he has,and he torments them. 
user2: Is the neighbor a human or a toy?
user1: Its classified as a comedy also. 
user1: He is a Human
user2: It should be...it's hilarious. I need to go see it. Thanks for all the information. Have a good day!

conversation:
user2: This movie is totally a classic
user1: I agree, it has strongly felt presences throughout the movie
user1: The scene where Buzz Lightyear discovers he is a toy is my favorite
user1: Do you like animation movies?
user2: Its been so long since I've seen the movie but it vaguely sounds familiar.
user1: Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are very familiar voices
user1: And actors in general
user2: I do not typically watch animated movies but somehow watch this one.
user1: Do you agree with the rating?
user1: Its rated 100 on Rotten Tomatos, thats a hard score to achiebe
user1: achieve I mean
user2: Somewhat skeptical but good for Toy Story. 
user2: No one ever gets an 100%
user1: I know but they somehow did. It was an incredible and wonderfully made animated movie
user2: The cast definitely made the movie. 
user1: I agree. Every character from Slinky the Dog to Woody to Buzz was wonderfully cast
user2: Whats the last movie you saw similar to this movie?
user1: Its such a pure movie for all ages as well. And a similar movie? Maybe Small Soliders
user1: But do you feel that this movie was pure?
user1: They say the purity of the movie is part of watch makes it
user2: Nice. I would have to say, I liked Small Solders better.
user1: Do you feel its really for all ages?
user2: Toy Story?
user1: Yes
user1: Like the scene where Buzz thinks hes an actual space ranger
user1: And when andy receives him
user2: That can be argued...All animated movies are partly for children and adults
user2: I think the producers know, for every child, there is a parent in watching in the theater with them.
user1: Yeah but this one had prankishness for adults more than the kids
user1: Toy Story also has a unusual look
user2: Right.
user2: What do you mean?
user1: It uses the freedom of imagination and the camera motions. Like when the cameras pull nback and hes a tiny little figure
user1: he was a massive guy two seconds before
user1: Its the realization
user2: Pixar revolutionized the animation business.
user1: Yes but with this movie especially dont you agree?
user2: Toy Story was the movie that got me interested 
user2: Yep
user1: The use of Bo Peep, Mr Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, Slinky Dog
user1: All familiar characters
user2: Hey you left the chat without saying goodbye

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: hey
user1: you ever seen toy story
user2: Hmmm!
user2: I don't think so
user1: oh it is a good movie you should see it then
user2: what about it?
user1: its a movie where toys come alive
user2: When was it released?
user1: back in 1995
user2: Toys coming alive? that must be a sci-fi movie
user1: nah its a disney movie
user1: for kids
user2: wow, quite old I must say
user1: yes very, but disney makes good movies
user2: I agree, what is the genre then
user2: ?
user1: comedy/animation
user2: I see
user1: that interest you?
user2: Yes, of course, I do comedy sometimes, but my love is for action
user1: i hear ya, i like action too
user2: can you give me a run down of the cast?
user1: yeah you got some big stars in it doing voices
user1: such as tom hanks, and tim allen
user2: and by the way, how did the movie rate with the different rating platforms?
user1: it got really high ratings
user2: Ok, Tom Hanks I know well\

user2: Wreck it Ralph its a cool movie
user2: Especially if like video games
user1: oh yes
user1: all the references were awesome to spot out here and there
user1: the next one is about the internet evidently. or at least thats how they're marketing
user1: not sure how they're gonna spin that
user1: hopefully they keep the video game vibe
user2: That Will be interesting to see 
user1: and thats an awesome message. they did a great job with them
user1: for sure
user1: i wonder if there will be another toy story in the future
user2: Lol
user1: unless they made it known that 3 is the cap
user1: guess its fitting
user1: threes seem to be popular in film
user2: Probably 
user2: Thats it
user2: Do you like those lego movies

user1: wow 
user2: that's about it
user1: thats really awesome
user2: what are you up to?
user1: you can end the conversation, they will still pay you.

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user2: Ever seen Toy Story?
user2: It's a computer-animated comedy by Pixar
user1: hey! I certainly have seen Toy Story. Woody and Buzz's rivalry formed an important part of my childhood
user2: Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were great
user2: Amazing chemistry
user2: I actually never knew that Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay
user1: Concur. I also didn't know that, wow. The movie expertly sold the idea that toys come to life when we're not looking
user1: Pixar kicked it off with a bang
user2: Hard to go wrong when Steve Jobs is executive producing :)
user2: Well-deserved Rotten Tomatoes score... 100%!
user2: Hard to believe it's been 23 years since it came out. Wow.
user1: I know, and it's still so timeless. Definitely worthy of A ratings
user2: Do you normally watch animated movies?
user1: Sometimes, being as I have kids. I'm looking forward to introducing this one, partially because Pixar is quite skilled at creating films that tickle adult fancy
user2: It's good for kids. The protagonist, Andy, is only 6
user2: I love the scene where the green army men spy on the party with the baby monitrs
user2: monitors*
user1: Espionage can be child-friendly! Sarge was a great character with a truly iconic voice
user2: Haha
user2: And buzz thinking he's actually a space ranger
user2: Classic!
user1: my memory of the film is faded, but it was truly heart-wrenching when Buzz realizes that he's just a plastic toy
user2: Who was your favorite side character?
user2: Mr Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, Slinky?
user1: Probably Mr. Potato Head, because of his cynicism
user1: What would you say was your favorite part?
user2: Pizza Planet was a great concept too
user2: I love the crane game part
user2: And the characterization of the villain, Sid
user1: Oh yeah, the crane was great. I was pretty upset that I couldn't actually go to Pizza Planet
user2: Haha
user2: They should build real-life Pizza Planets
user1: Sid remains my favorite character. Much better than boring Andy
user2: Yeah, and his dog too
user2: Scud!
user1: Scud was a real bad dude, chasing the RC car in the road like he did
user2: Can't believe Andy gets a puppy
user2: Making those toys' lives hell!
user1: I guess the filmmakers wanted to compare/contrast the two boys in a more obvious way. And yeah, I would be dang worried if I were a toy. It's bad enough wondering if you're going to be replaced by the new guy, then there's a crazy dog running around
user2: Haha right
user2: I miss Woody and the gang
user2: Hope they return soon
user1: Toy Story 4 is coming, but I don't know if it'll match this. The dynamic between Woody and Buzz, how they go from rivals to best friends, is one of the best I've ever seen

conversation:
user1: Hi
user1: ?
user2: Hello
user1: How's it going
user2: Going good. Im not quite sure what I should do lol
user1: I think you have to read the doc and tell me about the movie
user2: The movie is Toy Story
user2: everybody has seen that
user1: What's it about?
user2: Im sure as you know in that movie there is a boy named Andy who has some toys that happen to interact with each other when Andy isnt around
user2: You have Woody as the cowboy
user1: Is it live action or animated?
user2: Buzz Lightyear as a space ranger and its an animation
user1: Who does the voices?
user2: It was directed by John Lasseter
user2: Tom Hanks was the voice of woody
user2: Tim allen as the voice of Buzz
user1: Yikes. John Lasseter was just accused of harassment in the media!
user2: oh lordy
user1: Is it a Disney movie?
user2: The movie came out in 1995
user2: yes it is
user1: Is it scary?
user1: Like is it a kid's movie or would an adult enjoy it?
user2: Not scary at all. Its a kids movie that I still watch to this day
user2: Kids and adults would enjoy it
user1: Did you see it in theaters originally?
user2: I cant remember if I did honestly
user1: Are there any sequels?
user2: yes they have toy story 2 and 3
user1: Did you enjoy it?
user1: What's it rated?
user2: I absolutely loved it and it was rated a 9/10 on rotten tomatoes

conversation:
user2: Hello

user1: Oh, I would love to see that!  It looks great, can you tell me more about it

user2: It has good critacal responces
user2: it says that the movie is a work of genius
user1: That's good, and average people seem to like it too?
user1: Wow, that's a huge compliment
user2: yeah, it has a Rotten Tomatoes of 100% and average 9/10
user2: Cinema score A
user1: dang that's really high
user2: and Metacritic Score of 95/100
user1: what is the basic plot line again? remind me
user2: So its a pretty good movie to enjoy with the family
user1: yeah I think we have the VHS somewhere
user2: and the plot is about a wold in where toys are living things who preted to be lifeless when humas are present
user1: such a clever idea
user2: then the main characters are Woody and the famouse Buzz Lightyear
user2: they have a rivalry at first but then become the greatest friends
user1: oh that's right, they are fighting to be the favorite toy or something?
user2: Tom Hanks is Woody and  Tim Allen is Buzz Lightyear,
user2: Yeah
user2: they fight to be the favorite one
user1: great cast, I never knew it was them
user2: Woody is actually jelous at first
user2: And yeah, great cast indeed, 
user1: who else is in it?
user2: Don Rickles as Mr. Potatoe Head, Jim Varney as Slinky dog
user1: not sure I'm familiar with them
user2: and Wallace Shawn as Rex
user2: Rex is one of my favorites
user2: And I dont know them either
user2: So I hope you watch it
user2: its a really great movie
user1: I liked him too, he was funny.  Well it looks like we have met the requirements of this HIT, I appreciate the recap of Toy Story, definitely a favorite classic.  I will rewatch it soon, my 2 year old has never seen it
user2: ok great
user2: have a nice day
user2: bye
user1: thanks have a great day

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi there
user1: This comedy got an amazing rotten tomatoes score
user2: Have yOu seen that movie Toy Story?
user1: Yeah! With Tom Hanks as Woody, right?
user2: Yes it looks like it got good ratings all the way around
user1: I like the space ranger action figure. I think he was played by Tim Allen.
user2: , Tom Hanks is the best
user1: The Director, John Lasseter, did a great job.
user2: What was the Space Rangers name wasn't it Buzz?
user1: Buzz Lightyear!
user2: It was really amazing how they did the animation
user1: I think it was the first feature-length computer-animated film.
user2: It's really sad when Buzz realizes that he's a toy
user1: At least Andy's birthday party was exciting - even if it got moved up a week.
user2: It seemed to bring imagination to adults and kids alike it's strange how they were able to make toy seem real
user1: So real that Buzz was able to impress other toys!
user2: I bet Woody really did feel left out when Buzz got all the attention
user2: Pizza Planet sounds like a really cool place
user1: He probably felt good when he accidentally bumped him out of a window though.
user1: I want to go to Pizza Planet too! As long as Sid Phillips isn't there.
user2: Yes that was too funny and then all the toys turned on him but kind of sad too
user2: Yep Sid was pretty scary
user1: The chase scene with the truck was intense.
user2: At least the toys did realize that what he was not a bad guy
user1: You can tell that Woody and Buzz are getting closer by Woody's joking.
user2: Thank goodness for RC that he was able to help them all get back together
user1: And then they got to see Andy's new puppy! Although it might not treat toys nicely.
user1: Toy Story is an awesome movie.
user2: It had to be scarywhen they lit the fuse and were flying the air

conversation:
user2: What did you think of the Toy Story movie?  I loved it!
user1: I really liked it too! I liked that Tom Hankds voiced Woody because he's one of my favorite actors.
user2: I agree, Tom Hanks is awesome.  I also liked Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.
user1: Do you typically like animated movies? 
user2: I do!  Especially Pixar movies.  
user1: Me too! I didn't realize Steve Jobs was involved in the production of Toy Story. 
user2: oh right, that's true, he had a big hand in Pixar's early life.  The critics sure loved Toy Story as well.
user1: They did - it has great ratings and I completely agree with the critics on this one. It's a great movie for both children and adults. 
user2: "a work of genius"  yes, yes it was.  :-)
user1: Definitely! I loved seeing Woody and Buzz go from rivals to friends. 
user2: I liked all the toy characters, they had really good comraderie
user1: Which was your favorite? I think I liked Slinky Dog best! 
user2: hm, i liked Buzz.  He's got such a big ego and big heart too!
user1: True. I liked that they threw a little romance in between him and Bo Peep the shepherdress. 
user2: Yes that was cute.  and how Mr Potato Head is wishing for Mrs Potato Head
user2: I don't think I ever had a fav toy that lastest year after year.
user1: Me either, so I can understand why the toys were nervous that they felt they were going to be replaced. I always replaced my toys. 
user2: oh, do you remember the bad neighbor kid Sid?  i remember some kids on my street growing up that liked to wreck action figures like that too.
user2: hello?  are you still there?
user2: darn.  ok, bye bye!

conversation:
user1: Hey, whats the movie called?
user2: I guess its toy stories
user2: have you watched toy stories ?
user1: There's three of them I think. Does it say it's by Disney?
user2: yup it is
user1: So which Toy Story movie are we talking about?
user1: If it's the first, second or third?
user1: The third came out a year or so ago I think, so it might be that.
user1: Wow, the 3rd came out in 2010 lol, way more than a year or two ago!
user2: I think its 1 but who cares all of them are interesting to watch isn't it
user1: Yeah they are, they are great kids movies and even entertaining enough for adults.
user2: you are right.
user1: It's definitely one of the most successful animated movies too.
user2: i think i watched it multiple times
user2: yup
user1: Same, I think I saw them a couple times in school too. Like before we had big breaks like the break before Christmas.
user2: I love tom hanks movies
user1: Yeah, he did good voice work in Toy Story too.
user2: i feel like i watched it yesterday
user1: I can't really remember the plots that well. I think the kid that owns all the toys was moving or something?
user2: i don't remember
user1: Regardless, they were great movies. Which character did you like more, Woody or Buzz Lightyear?
user2: but i can tell you its a good stress relief 
user2: of course Woody who else right
user1: Definitely. Movies are a great way to temporarily escape real world problems.
user1: I was more of a Buzz fan. I liked how passionate he was about his mission to return home.
user2: hmm
user1: I didn't like how Woody was so jealous of Buzz, when I watched it as a kid
user2: I don't recall but may be he was jealous, who cares its a movie after all.
user1: True. I think I heard that they might be making a 4th Toy Story movie.
user1: I wonder what the plot of that will be. Woody would definitely be in it though.
user2: thats good 
user2: of course he will be there :) 
user1: He will probably find some way to save the day too!
user2: yup
user1: Now that I think about it, Toy Story 1 had quite the cast of voice actors.
user1: Tim Allen voiced Buzz, which I didn't realize when I watched the movie as a kid.
user2: you are right
user2: I don't think about anything i just need a time pass so. I can be care less

user2: is this a disney or dreamworks movie
user1: Disney, pixar to be exact
user2: Why do the toys think they will be replaced :(
user1: they thought so because Andy was having a birthday party and might get new toys
user2: What part does Tom Hanks play
user1: Woody, the main character
user2: How about Tim Allen
user1: Buzz, the main antagonist at first then he becomes a friend
user2: What kind of toy is Woody?

conversation:

user1: I love the movie we are about to talk about.
user2: Hello,
user2: I love it too!
user1: I know right?
user2: Tom Hanks makes a great Woody, as if I did not love him enough before this movie
user1: It is probably my favorite Disney movie :D
user2: Definitely a favorite. Apparently we are not the only ones to think so since the rates were really high
user1: I know right?
user1: a 100%!
user1: Thats crazy.
user1: Well deserved in my opinion.
user1: This movie definitely help me take care of my toys when I was a kid, plus the movie was such an adventure.
user2: Definitely deserved
user2: Did you have any favorite parts?
user2: I seriously remember the first hour of that movie almost word by word with animated noises and everything.
user2: I thank my younger sister for that who would watch this movie everyday about 7 times a day :)
user1: Hahaha
user1: I have!
user1: The one where the bad kid ran away when the toys scared the SH*t out of him hahaha
user1: I believe his name is Sid.
user2: HAHAHAHA!!! I was just thinking of Sid!
user1: How about you?
user2: Yes thats him.
user1: Sid deserved it hahahahaha
user2: I love when Buzz has his melt down at the tea party. So funny!
user1: HAHAHAHAHA
user1: DAMN! I love that too!
user1: I seriously want to watch it again.
user2: ''I am Mrs Nesbit!''
user1: Maybe tonight.
user1: HAHAHAHAHA
user1: You crack me up my friend hahaha.
user2: So funny!
user1: Do you like Woody or Buzz?
user2: I couldn't possibly choose between either character although I am a serious Tom Hanks fan so if I HAD to choose it would be Woody. You?
user1: I like Buzz but Woody, you got a friend in him.
user1: This is falling! With style! LOL.
user2: I love that sound so much I was trying to find it on Youtube!
user2: ''YOU ARE A TOY!''
user1: Hahaha
user1: True.
user1: Pizza Planet!
user2: ''You're not the real Buzz Lightyear! You are a child's plaything''
user1: I want my childhood back. :(
user2: Pizza Planet, yes!
user2: HAHAHA
user1: Thanks a lot for the great conversation, you really cracked me up mate.
user1: You have a good one alright?
user1: :)
user2: I know! It was really great sharing this with you too! 
user2: I can't stop smiling right now!
user1: Haha
user1: Sure thing.
user1: :D
user2: :D

conversation:
user2: I really liked the look of Toy Story especially when it first came out, it was so unique compared to the other animation of the era.
user1: Yes, it was the first computer animated movie. 
user2: I also think it really is what led Pixar to grow with the success it had
user1: Yes, Pixar is known for its animation. The storyline of this movie was interesting. Who would have thought a story about toys would be successful?
user1: Tom Hanks did a wonderful job as Woody
user2: I think it was going to be good with kids, but it really did transcend to adults. Probably because of the established cast with Tim Allen and Tom Hanks.
user1: Tim Allen as Buzzyear was great. The whole movie was a bunch of rag tag toys trying to ensure they move with Andy. It was a cute storyline.
user2: Yeah it really was a work of genius to make that film, especially with the highs and lows of a cowboy and an astronaut.
user1: critics received it well too. i see it was given a 95 out of 100 on metacritic
user2: Yeah I see rotten tomatoes gave it a 100%, that's nearly impossible seeming.
user1: Yes, so many users agreed that the storyline was good and believable. It is difficult to achieve such a high rating. 
user2: It's probably the buddy comedy portions of it that really led things to be relatable to get the high rating.
user1: I agree. Critics said Tom brought belieivability to Woody. They also called toy Story one of fhe best voiced animated features in memory. 
user2: It definitely is, I had not realized that Don Rickles was Mr. Potato Head, bringing in a lot of big names really helped them keep the story in memory for people.
user1: yes, Don is funny too. The movie definitely had the right talent cast for the parts. Everyone worked great together. Each was unique and brought something different to the table. 
user2: It definitely is, the music by Randy Newman also managed to make the film just a bit more magical.
user1: Most definitely, the music helps keep you interested in the film. Randy did a good job of selecting appropriate pieces.
user2: Yeah he did. I really did enjoy the theme of the toys going lifeless too when there were people around. It gave wonder to the toys that people have.
user1: Yes, I can see why the critics called it a work of genius. It opened up your imagination of how toys would act if possible. It was a great movie. 
user2: The imagination that was used really was revolutionary, John Lasseter really put a lot into making the scenes tell a story.
user1: Yes, the director brought everything to life. Toy Story is considered a legendary movie. John did an excellent job of bringing the toys to life. 
user2: I liked how the neighbor Sid Philips was the ultimate enemy, and led the toys to team up together.
user1: Ha ha ha. I liked how Woody and Buzz worked together as a team on mission to get ready for the new toys to arrive. It was so cute.
user2: I liked the end where the surprise "toy" wound up being a puppy and after their experience with Sid's dog they had their comical nervousness. 
user1: Yes, that was adorable. It was interesting to see Buzz brag and show off his features to the other toys.
user2: Yeah it was a shame Woody felt left out, especially when Andy decided to take Buzz with him instead of Woody to the Pizza Planet.
user1: Yes, it was a little sad. Woody wanted to be Andy favorite too. 
user1: I enjoyed the part where the toys would go limp when people were present. 
user2: Yeah, it led Woody to have to go crazy to try to get himself taken instead of Buzz. The toys going limp was always good as well.

conversation:
user2: Hello. How are you?
user1: Hi, have you seen the movie Toy Story?
user2: No, I haven't.
user2: Can you tell me something about it?
user1: Sure, it's an animated comedy film
user2: Oh, sounds interesting.
user2: What is it about?
user1: Well, it follows a group of toys who come to life when no one is looking. They pretend to be lifeless when humans are present
user2: Oh wow! Sounds like a movie my daughter would like. 
user2: How did the critics rate it?
user1: It was very well received by critics. It got a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 95/100 Metacritic score. So almost everyone who watches loves it.
user2: Oh my!! I don't think I've ever seen a 100% rating!
user2: It must be good.
user2: What year was it made?
user1: It was a 1995 release
user2: Do you know who directed it?
user1: Sure, the director was John Lasseter.
user2: He does a great job on films.
user1: It also has some big names for the voice roles including Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Don Rickles
user2: I love Tim Allen and Tom Hanks! They are great actors!
user2: I'll definitely have to look into this movie!
user2: Did they make any sequels?
user1: I'm not sure about that
user2: What did you think of the movie?
user1: I think it's a great film that adults can also enjoy. One critic says "It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids."
user2: I would believe that. Kids films do a great job adding adult humor that goes over the kids heads.
user1: It's fun because they incorporate a lot of classic toys including a pull-string cowboy, Mr Potato Head, Green Army Men, and toy dinosaurs
user2: It sounds good.
user1: In one scene the green army men, led by the character Sarge spies on a party, and reports thefindings to the other toys via baby monitors. It's light-hearted in its approach
user2: I'm interested in watching it now
user2: Oh that's cool.
user1: The two main characters are the toys Woody, and Buzz Lightyear. Initially they have a rivalry competing for the affection of their owner Andy, but eventually become friends who work together to be reunited with Andy when their family decides to move to a new home
user1: Do you usually like animated comedy movies?
user1: The performance of Tom Hanks was really great in the film
user1: I like the scene when Andy opens a new gift for Christmas, and it's a puppy. The toys look worried that they will be forgotten.
user1: Overall it's a very well liked film, that some critics put in their top ten of all time

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hey hey
user2: how are you doing
user2: you've seen this movie before
user1: totally, a cassic
user2: lol i know
user2: lol
user1: love tom hanks
user1: 100 percent on RT? Totally deserves it.
user2: I know his the best. when i first saw it i hated it i guess I didnt understand woody
user2: But after rewatching i love everything
user1: I saw it in theatres, was razzled, dazzled, and very impressed. That sort of animation was a big deal back then. Nobody had seen it before. Funny to think about now.
user2: I didn't see it in the movies I saw it on tv. did you see the second part
user1: sure, not as good
user2: Yeah
user1: Also the thought of abandoning one toy for another like Andy does to Woody for Buzz, was really affecting
user1: it truely was a 1995 comedy adventure
user2: yeah, but it does happen though, you get tired of one and then get a new one
user2: For some reason I used to think buzz was george clooney
user2: it's tim allen
user1: Reading back the key scenes: the army men, scouting andy's birthday party when he gets buzz. Great gag!
user2: oh wow 100% on rotten tomatoes
user1: everybody loves it!
user2: ha haha ha
user2: yup
user1: and those little alien dudes in the vending machine at pizza planet. hilarious 
user2: they are like the minions
user2: omg the minions from descipable me
user2: do other great movies do you like
user2: ?
user1: I didn't see it. But the jealousy of somebody new taking over and getting the attention, feeling like you're not special anymore, a very real and relatable aspect of buzz and woody's relationship
user2: what other good movies do you like?
user1: I felt for all the toys, like potatohead voiced by don rickles, but to be honest, I was a little like sid growing up
user1: I like personal shopper
user2: which one is that
user1: with kristen stewart. it's kind of new. great blend of the literal material world with the spirit world. very good, check it out!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hi, how did you like toy story?
user2: I thought it was good! My kids really enjoy it
user2: what about you?
user1: I loved it too! What was your favorite character?
user2: I liked bo peep but I also really loved woody 
user2: what about you?
user1: I love slinky dog.
user2: Oh yeah!!! He was so cute and entertaining
user1: Did you like when Buzz realized he was a toy?
user2: I did although I thought that part was a little sad.  My favorite was when they come up with a plan to excape from sids
user1: I thought there were a lot of interesting lessons to be learned even for adults.
user2: yes me too I thought one of the best oes was about friendship and always being there for each other
user2: what lessons did you learn?
user1: Yes definitely, and how they discovered their worth wasn't just with Andy and he still loved them.
user2: Exactly!
user1: I cried through so much of that movie.
user2: Toy story was really ahead of its time
user2: me too
user1: I always believed my toys had feeling when I was a kid. I wish I could have seen it at that age.
user2: I completely agree! I always thought my toys had feelings 
user2: that movie really got my imagination going 
user2: I cant remember how old I was when it came out
user1: Yes, me too. I loved the rivalry between Woody and Buzz and how they ultimately had to team up to save the day.
user2: yep!  I was always so suprised that they got those two actors to do those parts
user1: The voices are everything, I don't think it could have been cast better.
user2: me either!
user1: It's the only movie that I could watch endless sequels of.
user2: I really love the voices they brought to them
user2: me too I think they are bringing out another one in a year or so
user1: I got a kick out seeing how they toys use their features to save and help each other.
user1: I'll be first in line if there is another one.
user2: I totally agree
user1: I love showing my little cousin's this movie and seeing their imaginations light up.
user2: I agree I showed it to my kids as soon as they were old enough to watch it...They love it so much! espically my 4 year old girl
user2: that is another  great thing about it both boys and girls like it 
user1: Yes it is completely universal, that is what makes it so special.
user2: Yes you are completely right!! 

conversation:
user1: Hello! How did you like the movie?
user2: It was alright. How did you?
user2: It seemed a little too old, it was made back in 1955.
user2: 1995*
user1: I loved it. Especially the animation and voices. I thought Woody was a hilarious character.
user1: It might be old but the story of the toys seems timeless.
user2: The slinky was my favorite character.
user1: I like Buzz Lightyear because I love Tim Allen.
user2: I've never heard of Jim Varney, but he was a great slinky.
user1: I see it was executive-produced by Steve Jobs. I wonder if that's the same Steve Jobs from Apple.
user2: Lol I doubt it. But it would be awesome if Steve jobs did produce it. Steve Jo produced the hallmark of the greatest children's films. 
user1: I liked the scene where Buzz thinks he's a big shot hero but then the camera reveals him to be a tiny toy.
user2: Yea Buzz got what he deserved for trying to rival Woody lol
user1: But at least they become best friends
user1: Do you like animated movies?
user2: Right. You know for this film to be considered Adventure I thought there would of been alot more action. 
user2: Normally I love animated movies. Especially when they're funny.
user1: I thought the green Army men were funny. 
user1: I like how they were true to their toy character by spying for the other toys
user2: Hilarious! Especially how they would report by baby monitors.
user1: I feel bad for Woody at the beginning when he thinks he's being replaced by Buzz
user2: Yea I did too. It wasn't cool when he tried to trap Buzz, but i understand why.
user1: And then when the family left without them at the gas station. That was troubling
user2: That caused them to start working together, they stowed away on the pizza delivery truck.
user1: I hate how they almost escaped but then Sid's dog started chasing them
user2: Right.I'm just glad the other toys decided to help after seeing them together.
user1: Such a bummer that RC's battery died
user1: Luckily Buzz had his rocket to save them
user2: And then they got to land safely into that box in the car
user1: And then Andy got a puppy!
user1: I bet Buzz and Woody were scared
user2: Yep definitely explains those worried smiles 

conversation:
user2: Hey there!
user1: Hello.
user1: How are you?
user2: I am doing great, you?
user1: All good!
user1: I am excited to talk about Toy Story!
user2: Tell me about it, I think it is arguably the best Pixar movie of all time!
user1: No argument there hahaha
user2: I feel like everyone loves Toy Story.
user1: Hahaha, who would hate it?
user1: Maybe Sid?
user2: Sid!
user2: Hahaha
user2: That's the kid right?
user2: I mean the bully kid.
user1: Yeah, hes the one haha.
user2: Hahaha, I loved that scene where the gang decided to scare him.
user1: LOL! That was the best and funniest part!
user2: Hahaha, yeah. Good for him!
user1: Right, haha.
user1: And afterwards the adventure was just amazing even if it were just toys in it haha
user2: Haha, yeah.
user2: Very exhilirating haha/
user2: Hahaha..
user1: And hilarious writing too.
user1: I miss it, I want to rewatch it again.
user2: Same.
user2: Who's your favorite character?
user1: It would be Woody of course!
user2: Haha, well you got a friend in him! 
user2: I would go for Buzz since hes very funny, and heroic haha.
user1: Yeah.
user1: He is funnier since he did not know that he was a "Childs play thing" hahaha
user2: Yeah.
user2: He almost got crazy lol.
user2: Jesus look at that Rotten Tomatoes rating.
user2: 100%!
user1: RIGHT?!
user1: A masterpiece. Well deserved.
user2: Haha, true, thanks for the great conversation.
user1: Thanks! Have a good one, bye.
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you seen the movie, Toy Story, directed by John Lasseter?
user1: Yes I have, what was a notable part for you?
user2: I really enjoyed the recognizable voices of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. I pretty much enjoy anything they're in. How about you?
user1: The movie has been a childhood favorite of mine and I loved them putting a mind behind a toy and showing what a toy may be thinking in everyday scenarios.
user2: I remember watching it when it first came out I was still a young teen. The animation wasn't like the other animated movies I'd seen, and the storyline was relatable. Now I let my own children watch it. I really enjoy watching them enjoy it too.
user1: It was revolutionary for its time that is for sure and I am sure it will be enjoyed for generations especially with toy story land being built at Disney World
user2: Yeah, I often felt like my toys had conscious' when I was a kid, like they had feelings. I think the movie did a good job of portraying emotion of different variety among each toy's personality.
user1: Exactly and the whole idea behind how toys could be evil was an interesting thing to grasp as a kid
user2: The same way the boy had a relationship with Woody, only to be replaced by Buzz Lightyear, the new flashy toy. I see that all the time with my boys. But they always return to their old favorite.
user1: Yes you always have those faithful toys you return and Toy Story did a great job showing that and I loved the part where eventually they resolve their differences and become friend many people need to work on this in todays society even.
user2: Agreed, the toys competing for Andy's affection reminds me of a grade school click among the girls I new in private catholic school. The entire emotional personas of the characters was spot on.
user1: Oh yes they hit clicks spot on in the movie and showed that sometimes you gotta put aside your differences to overcome a challenge in this case returning to Andy.
user2: I enjoy the movie, Toy Story, even more now as an adult, than I did as a kid, especially getting to see my own children relate to the emotions of the movie. I feel like the writers and producers knew what they were doing, and did a great job of it to create longevity for this movie becoming a classic enjoyed by generations to come.
user2: Tell me what you thought of the score it received by Rotten tomatoes?
user1: Exactly and the directors did a great job of adding characters in such as mr potato head to add a huge comedic value to the movie which helps it appeal to more than just one audience. I agree completely with its review score the tactics it employed in the movie to snag the viewers attention was great and It really is a movie that can cross generations
user2: I thought it did really well 100% by Rotten Tomatoes and averaging 9/10, I'm not surprised.
user1: Yes and rightfully so I believed it was nominated for a couple Oscars on top of that
user2: The scene at the pizza party is so relatable, watching the terror of the toys realizing that the family had left without them. I remember forgetting toys and the emotions felt by that was so traumatizing as a kid. I felt the toy's emotions then. The movie did a beautiful job of giving me the feels.
user1: I know what you mean leaving toys behind as a kid broke your heart and they did a good job showing that toys felt the same way when their owners left without them. It was definitely a touching movie
user2: Also I enjoyed the neighbor kid, the bad kid, I remember that kid growing up. The toys rightfully afraid of him. That Sid was my Jeremy on the bus.
user2: I really enjoyed each and every character having their own unique personality. I think I found Rex the most enjoyable with his timid and nervous behavior. Who was your favorite character?
user1: My favorite character was slinky dog
user1: or piggy bank too
user1: what about you?
user2: They we're both cute characters's. Why were they your favorite?
user2: I liked timid Rex, I found his nervousness endearing.
user1: slinky dog just because i love dogs plus his stretching ability was really cool as a kid and piggy bank was just hilarious too me
user1: aww trex was great I loved how each character added their own uniqueness to the movie
user2: The movie, Toy Story is so good because It has all the adventure packed in from what I loved from watching movies as a kid in the 80's, except now the adventurers are the toys trying to be reunited with Andy, their buddy. 
user1: Thats a really good way to put it had action comedy and everything most people want in a movie but in a kid friendly environment
user2: I think I'm going to have to turn on Toy Story this evening when my kids are home from school and pop some popcorn for a family fun night at home. Toy Story will be the perfect addition!
user2: It was a pleasure discussing Toy Story with you today!
user2: Have a great day!
user1: You too! great to see others thoughts

conversation:
user2: Pixar really did something with this film.  Incredible Rotten Tomato rating
user1: Yeah, it really set the bar high being the first full length animation film!
user2: absolutely
user1: Tom Hanks was the perfect fit for this film too
user2: Yes he really tied together the Woody character
user1: I had no idea this was John Lasseters first film he directed
user2: I didn't realize that either
user2: Steve Jobs executive produced?  Didn't know that
user1: Yeah! That was news to me too!
user1: What about Randy Newman though.... must admit i'm not a big fan of his music
user2: Not sure I'm familiar with his music, probably would recognize it if I heard something
user1: There were so many good characters in this movie
user1: The green army men were great
user2: Yeah.  Things got a little tricky for the toys when Andys party got moved up a week
user1: Whos side were you on? Woodys or Buzz's?
user2: I leaned towards buzz as the movie went on
user2: how about you
user1: I felt like Buzz was definitely stepping on Woodys territory in the beginning of the movie but I agree with you
user2: He was a show off at first, then Woody got too sorry for himself lol.  
user1: Yeah, there we go, Andy was favoring Buzz and I felt sorry for Woody 
user2: Then the Sid character comes in
user2: He was creepy
user1: Oh man, Sid definitely creeped me out
user1: He was a memorable character for sure
user1: Pizza Planet was one of my favorite scenes
user2: yes indeed.  That gave things a good twist.  Yes pizza planet was awesome
user1: I forgot about Scud!
user2: oh yeah, me too
user2: and the rocket scene was cool
user1: Pretty violent scene for a kids movie, they don't make them like that anymore unfortunately...
user2: then christmas comes and woody and buzz did the reconn to see what new toys were arriving and it was a puppy.  
user1: hahaha I forgot about the puppy scene
user1: what an ending

conversation:
user1: hi this movie sounds great I mean 9/10 ratings that is pretty epic for a movie and 100% on rotten tomatos
user2: Yeah, wow! Pixar first full length feature!
user1: not to mention being a comedy animation and adventure in one
user2: I like the critical response about the scene when Buzz realizes he's a toy.
user1: yeah that is a good part and critical responses are something to view what is good and what isn't
user1: i liked the term razzle dazzle myself because it gives an unusual look they say
user2: Razzle Dazzle is a great description! Plus I really like the voice cast! They got some big names like Tom Hanks to do it!
user2: I can just see Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, too.
user1: haha yeah and tom hanks is the best part of the movie i think hands down of the cast choices
user2: It kind of surprised me that this was done in 1995, which is 23 years ago.
user1: yeah same but that makes it a classic worth seeing it seems based on everything read
user2: Yeah,totally a classic worth seeing! 
user1: i love when they talk about its the work of genius it tells you that the plot and the story itself on top of the ratings tell you it is a must see movie
user2: I guess I might sort of bugged about that, except in this case, it's probably true. Interesting that Steve Jobs was a producer on it. I am guessing that this is THE Steve Jobs from Apple.
user1: you know I did not catch that until you mentioned it but wow I would think the man from apple as well. Well that being said it might make this a even more must-see because I never knew the man did anything more than computers
user2: So the last reviewer puts this movie in his top ten list. Would it be in your top 10 list of movies? Or maybe top 10 list of kids' movies?
user1: that is a good question I mean I would think movies in general honestly based on the ratings itself I mean I wouldn't separate it into kids movies due to the rating cause very few movies get that kind of rating from rotten tomatoes.
user2: Great points! I love how Disney movies always have life lessons for kids and adults. The relationship evolution between Buzz and Woody and the lessons about jealousy when Buzz shows up are great messages for all of us.
user2: Plus the humor appeals to kids and adults.
user1: I do agree disney movies are really great for doing that. I love that with this story, in particular, it gives you an idea that imagination happens. The fact that these toys are lifeless around humans present but alive when they are gone is a great touch to the imagination in our every day lives as kids. But yes the humor appeals to everyone so that's what drags us adults into them as well
user2: What a great job to make a living using your imagination to come up with stories like this! And then write the dialogue. The one reviewer talked about the toys being true to their character. It's a real gift to be able to bring toys to life!
user1: I normally don't sit down and watch movies these days like this one but this movie is worth every minute of time. It's too interesting not to watch no matter your age. but I do agree to be able to do this for a living making something so artistic is a dream come true.
user2: Plus the scenarios they come up with like being trapped in a crane game, knocking Buzz out of the window, etc. How fun and how much they really make this movie great.
user1: when the family left without them after getting gas though was a kind of sad part in the movie to me. I mean I still think the movie is great but it is still a sad point.
user2: I suppose every great movie makes us feel a range of emotions. What a triumph when Buzz and Woody use the rocket and then glide to a safe landing!
user1: But the part that I did love that was pretty funny was when woody and buzz couldn't imagine a new toy being worse than buzz then they see its a puppy i laughed at their expressions on their face when they looked so worried
user1: oh yes i was so happy they made a safe landing we didn't need a tragedy to happen :)
user2: Yeah, that was a great moment! I wondered if we would get a sequel to this movie. I hope, I hope!
user1: That would be great if we did. I think the director John Lasseter did an amazing job with this movie and writing technique.
user2: I wondered if the puppy would get to see the toys in action or if they go lifeless for the puppy, too. I agree that the director did a super job! It makes me want a Toy Story 2.
user1: sam here and yeah would be kind a cool to see if they talk to the puppy or if they can communicate or not

conversation:
user2: Hey! So, did you enjoy the movie?
user1: Yes. It was great
user2: Me too. I think it's one of the highest rated RT movies of all time
user2: Do you have a favorite character?
user1: Yes I like Buzz Lightyear
user1: How about you
user2: I think Slinky  Dog is the sweetest,  even though he's of course a supporting character. He's worried and loyal
user1: Yes I like him too
user1: My second fav is Mr. Potato
user2: Haha, he's pretty funny. Rex is a pretty good neurotic mess
user1: Yes he is
user1: I can't believe it was made in 1995!
user2: I know :( I'm so old. But I think it really holds up
user2: I didn't realize Joss Whedon worked on the script
user1: I didn't either. To get 100% on Rotten Tomatoes it has to be good though
user2: Indeed. It didn't hurt having a bunch of big names as the voices
user1: Very true. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have voices that you can't mistake
user2: Have you seen any of the sequels?
user1: Yes. They are good too but not like the first. How about you?
user2: Yeah, both of them. I would have to agree with you, the original really stands out
user2: Sid  Phillips (the neighbor boy) is a pretty perfect villian for a kids movie
user2: *villain
user2: I was genuinely worried when  I was a kid watching him blow up the toys
user1: Yes he is. It was easy to get lost in this movie thinking it was real!
user2: I think every kid has wondered at least momentarily about how it would be like if their toys were real :) It's a great premise
user1: I totally agree. It was a great idea for a movie
user2: and you really feel the anxiety from Woody when he thinks he's being replaced :(
user1: Yes. It was really heart breaking. You actually feel for the toys as if they are real characters.
user1: I love Sid's dog too!!!
user1: Very funny
user2: I think the funniest characters were the little crane machine aliens
user2: "Oooooo" haha
user1: The army men crack me up too!
user2: They take their job very seriously!
user1: Yes they do. Really funny how they use baby monitors
user2: Very resourceful, haha
user2: Well, chat later! Take care :)
user1: Well. Nice chatting with you

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello there, have you heard of the movie Toy Story?
user1: yes
user1: but i have never watched it
user2: It is such a great movie you HAVE to see it!
user1: really 
user1: tell me more about it
user2: It's got 100% on Rotten Tomatoes 
user1: oh 
user1: i didnt know that
user2: It's about these toys that come to life. They are owned by a kid named Andy and they go on all kinds of adventures in the 3 movie series. 
user1: oh and do u think a 2 yar old can watch it ?
user2: The main characters are Woody, a toy cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear, a toy who doesn't know he is a toy like everyone else does. He really thinks he is a space ranger
user2: Perhaps, the age range may be a little higher, but I could see how a 2 year old would find enjoyment while wathcing!
user1: well 
user2: It is a comedy as well so it is a great family movie
user1: i might try to wacth it with him this weekend
user2: Yeah you should! It's a classic
user1: i hope he likes the toys in the movie 
user1: he moves a lot ...
user2: I'm sure he will! Buzz lightyear creates a bit of conflict between the rest of the toys because he is seen as the favorite. It should be able to hold the attention of your 2 year old
user1: i think buzzlight voice is tim allen 
user2: Eventually Buzz wins over most of the toys with his cool features such as his ray gun and ability to fly
user1: am i right ?
user2: That is correct, and Tom Hanks is Woody
user1: oh !
user1: tom hanks is in it ??
user1: thats news for me
user2: Yeah hes a great actor
user2: There is a scene where Buzz and Woody try to make it onto the moving van so they don't get left behind when the family moves, but the neighborhood dog chases them. It's pretty good. 
user2: They get help from the RC car with a rocket to help try to get them to catch up to the van
user1: u making me think about actually watch this 
user2: I've watched it multiple times throughout my childhood and it still entertains me to this day!
user1: huh
user1: how old is this movie ?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello. We have to talk about this movie of 1995 Toy Story. Have you watched it?
user1: Of course
user1: Many times as a kid actually.
user2: So you do know what's going on on the movie... Did you like this movie?
user1: I loved it as a kid, although it's been a while since I've seen it.
user2: Of course you must remember it is an American computer-animated buddy comedy adventure film
user2: Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless wheneverhumans are present
user1: Yeah, I remember it very well.
user2: Some famous actors like Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn have borroed their voices in this film...
user1: Yes, love those actors.
user1: Specially Tim Allen.
user2: This film scored a rating of 100% in rotten tomatoes and average: 9/10. Also, 95/100 at Metacritic Score. Do you agree with the rating of the movie? 
user1: Yes, seems like a fair rating to me.
user2:  Do you generally watch movies with good or bad ratings?
user1: I love the music by Randy Newman by the way.
user2: Yes music was great in this film at that time
user1: Did you know the executive producer was Steve Jobs?, he was with Pixar at the time.
user2: Oh really? I didn't know that..
user1: Yeah.
user2:  I liked this scene where Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him,making Woody feel left out and as Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his motherallows him to bring one toy... do you remember this scene?
user1: Yeah, I remember I wanted to go to a real Pizza Planet as a little kid.
user2: Woody attempts to trap Buzzbehind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toysrebel against him
user1: Yeah, I remember.
user2: what was your favourite scene?
user1: I remember I was creeped out by what Sid did to the other toys.
user1: I loved when Woody spooked the hell out of Sid
user2: yeah these scenes were cool
user2: I also remember when Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into thetruck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocketbefore it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy. This was a lot of action...
user1: Yeah, remember the ending on Christmas?
user2: I remember that at the end Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissancemission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worsethan Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile. haha
user1: Yeah, that was a great ending.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi. Have you seen Toy Story? I though Tom Hanks did a great job as Woody. 
user1: I've only seen bits of it.
user1: a rare 100% on rotten tomatoes
user2: That is unusual! I think most people have seen it, or at least know of it. 
user1: i just noticed that joss whedon had a hand in writing it.  the buffy the vampire slayer guy
user2: I didn't realize that! It was also executive-produced by Steve Jobs. 
user1: interesting
user1: i think apple used to own pixar
user2: I don't actually know what that means. Executive-produced. 
user2: I liked how Woody and Buzz became friends when they had a common goal. 
user1: i think it means people who helped get financing
user1: yeah, it's funny to imagine toys competing at first
user2: It's also funny that the toy Buzz thought he was an actual space ranger. 
user1: is this a cartoon where the characters sing?
user2: I don't think there is any singing. 
user1: i might like it more then.  i'm not a fan of the musical cartoons.
user2: You probably would. Most people like Toy Story. 
user1: one thing that kept me away is that i don't like tim allen.  but i like many of the other voice actors.
user2: I guess I don't really notice the voice actors when watching a cartoon. 
user1: i prefer them to be non-celebrities, or celebrities who disguise their voice.  otherwise, it takes me out of the movie a bit.
user2: I enjoyed the fact that they got stuck in a crane game. And that somebody got them out. I'd never seen anybody get something from one of those. 
user1: i remember this scene about getting stuck in a "crane game"
user1: yeah, those games are rip-offs
user2: They got stuck because Buzz is convinced he's a real space ranger. 
user2: Imagine how angry you'd be if somebody got you stuck like that because they think they're something they aren't! 
user1: a dog named scud
user2: He was a pretty ugly dog, if I recall correctly. 
user1: looks like the movie ends with another dog, too
user2: Hopefully this one is a nicer one! 
user1: impossible to compete with a pet
user1: thanks for chatting

conversation:
user2: Hello 
user1: Hello!  
user1: Heard of any good movies? 
user2: I really like Toy Story, have you seen it?
user1: Oh, yes, I have seen that.  It is good. 
user2: my kids really enjoy it, I think its a classic
user1: My son loves it.  Do you know what year it was released?  
user2: It was released in 1995. Wow seems so long ago 
user2: Tom Hanks is also a fvorite actor of mine. I love him in this movie
user1: Yes, it does.  I did not see it for several years because I did not have a child yet.  Once I saw it with my son, I loved it. 
user1: Tom Hanks is great.  I also liked Tim Allen's character.  
user2: Yeah, Tim Allen is amazing as well. A lot of good actors in this one 
user2: Woody was always my favorite, but i love buzz to
user1: Do you know the Rotten Tomato score for the movie?
user2: 9/10 was there average
user2: it scored really well 
user1: Oh, it should be 10/10. 
user1: I guess a perfect score is too much to ask. 
user2: id give it a perfect score if it was me
user1: Wasn't that a Pixar movie or did that name come later?
user2: I believe it was a pixar animation 
user2: i think it was the first feature film produced by pixar
user1: Great.  Do you know if it won any awards?  
user2: Im not real sure if it won any awards or not. Id have to find out about that one 
user1: Gotcha.  I'm sure it probably won something. 
user2: id think so as well 
user1: I think that would be a good movie to see again over spring break with my son. 
user2: Yes we own it on DVD, it is one to watch over and over and never gets old
user2: The kids love seeing the toys come to life
user1: My son used to have this Buzz Lightyear figure that talked.  
user2: Yeah we have several of the toys. My mom actually has a woody toy that talks from when it first came out, Its pretty neat
user1: My son had that one, too.  It had a pull string on back. 

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: hello. This is a computer animated movie produced by Pixar for Disney
user1: what is it about?
user2: Movie critics gave this movie rave reviews (A+).
user1: what is the plot?
user2: It's about a group of toys that come to life when their owner isn't around. The main plot focuses on 2 friends, Buzz and Woody as they compete for their "owners" attention.
user1: Is it toy story?
user2: Yes
user1: good movie
user2: Do you like this genre of movie?
user1: no
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user2: The toys are only pretending to be lifeless when humans are present. They are all relieved after Andy's 6th bday party when none of them are replaced. But in a plot twist Buzz Lightyear is introduced  and he believes he is a real space ranger
user2: Did you know that Tom Hanks is the voice for Woody?
user2: Toy Story is one of the best voiced animated features
user2: hello??
user1: yes
user1: i dont like animations
user2: The freedom of imagination is what makes this movie so wonderful. This has been hallmarked as one of the greatest childrens films
user1: That's my point, its for kids.
user2: Adults and children can enjoy this critically acclaimed movie
user1: I need some mature entertainment.  Like action thrillers.
user2: We were all kids once with toys, How wonderful would it have been if they came to life
user1: Yea, but im an adult now and it's not fascinating anymore. 
user1: I am more in to action movies
user1: I dont get how adults can watch animations
user1: Never really made sense to me.
user1: Is there any particular reason why you like them?
user2: I like various genres of movies, I also have young children so I enjoy watching things they can enjoy and is appropriate
user2: Toy Story is one of my favorites that I shared with my younger brother. He was obsessed with Woody and Buzz and I have fond memories of that time in my life
user1: thats interesting
user1: I guess we just have to agree to disagree.
user1: hello?
user1: ???
user2: IM HERE
user2: Do you like comedies?

conversation:
user2: I really liked this movie.  My kids watched it so many times when they were young.  It's a great family movie.
user1: Oh yes. We loved this movie here also.
user1: I like Buzz Lightyear a lot.
user2: We still have the buzz lightyear and woody toy somewhere around here.
user2: Tom Hanks always does such a great job and so does Tim Allen.
user1: Yes. I agree. I love that Buzz Lightyear doesn't realize that he is a toy right away.
user1: I am not surprised that it got 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. 
user2: If you remember that whole scene with zurg was really good.  My son used to be afraid of zurg.   
user2: I'd have to say there isn't much bad anyone could say about this movie.
user1: I do not remember Zurg. But I do remember Rex and how nervous he always was.
user1: I agree. This was very well done.
user2: Do you know how long we are supposed to discuss this movie before we can end the conversation?  Have you ever done a survey like this before?
user1: I forgot about them spying on the birthday party. So funny !!!
user1: Yes, it will show up "Finish conversation" when we have talked enough. 
user1: "To infinity, and beyond !!!"
user2: Zurg was the character in the video game rex was always trying to defeat.
user2: In the end we find out zurg was buzz's father
user2: Thanks for the info
user1: It's been a long time since I have watched it. I just don't remember Zurg. 
user2: Yes!  To infinity and beyond!
user2: That's ok.  I'm surprised I remember as much as I do.

user1: I have not seen the 2nd one.
user2: I know I have but can't remember much about it right now

user1: Don Rickles makes a perfect Mr. Potato Head. LOL 
user2: He was funny
user2: Yes Don Rickles was hillarious
user2: Is he dead now?
user1: What can be worse than Andy getting Buzz Lightyear ?? A new puppy !!!   hahahaha

user1: Tom Hanks voiced as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. 
user1: I think the film was well made
user2: My boys now talk about it. They like it.
user1: 1995 was the perfect year to release it. 
user2: Why?
user1: It also received an "A"  on Cinemascore
user1: Well '95 was the beginning age of the internet and dot com boom although it was a disaster. 
user2: Oh! Is that relevant to the movie?
user1: It is we are talking about the time of the released film.
user1: Anyways, in scene 1 Andy Davis is having an upcoming birthday party.
user2: I'm sorry I thought something in the movie had to do with the internet or something.
user1: In scene 2 Buzz impresses the other toys with his features. 
user2: Right! They pretend to be lifeless when humans are around.
user1: In scene 3 the duo are attacked and chased by a dog. 
user2: So in the end the new toy that arrives is a puppy.

user1: His name was HAMM

user2: LOL hamm. Yes, so good. 
user1: So would you watch it again?
user2: I also really liked those little army toys that would run around too.
user2: Oh definitely, that movie was the definition of my childhood!
user1: I remember when I first saw it, I didn't like Buzz at all.
user2: Hahah! Why not?
user2: Buzz was a pretty big show off I must say.
user1: I felt like he was trying to show off to all the other toys and Andy, sorta forgot about Woody.
user1: Diddo!
user2: Did you have any parts of the film that stood out? 
user2: Or were your favorite?
user1: Well.... I just remember when Woody and Buzz get pulled out of the claw machine.
user1: All those aliens worshiped it.
user1: Do you have a favorite part?
user2: I can literally hear that scene now hahahaha that was great. 
user2: I really liked the whole pizza scene as well, and when they were trying to get across to Sid's house.
user2: All the scenes at Sid's house were really spooky as a child. That one toy with the baby head....spooked.
user1: Yes, the pizza truck! don't they drive it in that one.
user1: Yes, he ripped all the toys apart and 'acted' like a doctor preforming surgery. 
user1: Well its been great talking to you about Toy Story, Maybe you should re-watch it sometime in the future.
user1: Have a great day! Take care. 
user2: Same! Yeah I definitely will rewatch it!
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hey, have you heard of Toy Story?
user2: Yes I have,
user2: what do you think about toy story?
user1: It really great for what the movie is. Consider it the first digital animation movie, its really well lay out.
user2: I agree
user2: Definitely set the bar high for all other movies to follow
user1: I love the interaction between the character in the movie, it remind me of my childhood days.
user2: I agree. It had a lot of themes we could all relate to.
user1: It's a great reminder for adults, that we too were young children during our time.
user1: Tom Hanks voice acting is really awesome!
user2: What was your favorite scene
user1: When Buzz meets Woody for the first time.
user1: How about you?
user2: "We're not aiming for the truck!"
user1: It all really good. The character have a really good sense of humor that fit each one perfectly.
user2: Who do you like more, Woody or Buzz
user1: That a really though question. Both of them are really great choices. I would say Buzz, because all the girl seem to like him.
user2: I feel like woody was the mastermind though.
user1: Buzz was doing all the hard stuff, well Woody did was doing the thinking part.
user2: I would agree to that
user2: Buzz was the muscle and woody was the brains.
user1: Rex is a funny character
user2: He was quite entertaining.
user1: Potato Head had a great symbol behind him for the parents, in reminding them when life falls apart, you put it back together.
user2: I would agree to that. They also addressed the theme of marriage and how to stick it out through thick and thin.
user1: I give that a solid salute. The movie does stress really well on toy being abusive by kids.
user1: Abused*
user2: yeah, but toys can be broken and replaced. When they make the toys come alive it might confuse kids as to what is actually sacred life in this world.
user1: That's true. Every movie has it's pro and con.
user2: yes, I would say that is a small con.

user1: do you like toy story
user1: can you tell me what's about?
user2: YES I LIKE IT!
user2: Toy Story​ is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy adventure film produced byPixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The directorial debut of John Lasseter, ToyStory was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced byPixar. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless wheneverhumans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashionedpullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure(voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner,to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a newhome. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and AlecSokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film featuresmusic by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.
user2: IS A GOOD ONE!

user1: yes I love this movie 
user1: do you know that it was the first computer animated movie
user1: film 
user2: John Lasseter does a great job directing Toy Story.  And the ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and CinemaScore all seem to agree
user2: No I didnt know that.  Thats pretty cool
user1: I did not know it was a 95 movie 
user2: Tim Allen and Tom Hanks did great playing off each-other.
user1: yes they did 
user2: Randy Newman did a good job also with the music in the movie
user1: The story it self is great 
user1: what character do love in this film 
user2: I think it was a very creative idea to have all these talking toys working together to help their owner "Andy"
user1: I like Mr. Potato head 
user2: Also the idea of Woody being replaced by the better and newer Buzz Lightyear was a great plot line
user2: Yeah Mr potato head was great.  He is a funny character
user2: The nervous T-Rex played by Wallace Shawn was pretty good too.  But My favorite character would have to be Tom Hanks role as Woody
user1: being replaced by new better thing is a common fear and to include it in the story is a genius idea 
user2: Did you enjoy the sequels to this movie?
user1: yes I did very much 
user2: Its pretty clever how the toys are lifeless when humans are present
user1: I wonder if it is a good idea do a sequel where humans figure out that the toy are alife 
user2: ohh that would be cool
user1: I mean this movie has a great cast and great director 
user2: between all the movies we see a 6 year old Andy turn into a College bound Andy
user1: it would be fun 
user2: And we can't forget about the bully neighbor "Sid"
user2: One of my favorite parts of the movie was where woody and the other toys scared him half to death
user1: yeah that is funny 
user2: I think that was the only time they showed their true selves in front of a human
user2: It did take the other toys a while to prove to buzz that he wasnt am actual space ranger
user2: an*
user1: yeah that would be another good sequel, how did these toys came to live
user1: Thank you
user2: yeah that is a good idea..we could call it "Toy Story..The Beginning"

user2: i also like when andy begins to favor buzz and woody feels left out - it's a relateable scene
user1: oh yes, that is a great scene too. 
user1: i agree with the critical response where it is written about how at times, this movie will tickle adults even more than it does kid. i think that is true
user2: yes, i think it's very similar to many child films, where kids will like it for the humor but adlts will appreciate it more 
user2: especially as they age
user1: Andy's neighbor Sid and his dog Scud are some trouble makers
user1: but i did enjoy watching scenes with the dog Scud and Woody and Buzz. It was entertaining

user2: yes I am
user1: Did you know Toy Story was the first feature-length computer-animated film before reading the document?
user2: really thats cool
user2: do you know the ratings
user1: I did not before reading this. It's really highly rated. I had no idea Steve Jobs is an executive producer.
user1: I also didn't know Joss Whedon is one of the writers.
user2: thats interesting I did not know that either
user2: what is your favorite scene
user1: I really like the scene where they introduce Buzz Lightyear. Do you have a favorite scene?
user2: where the toy soldiers go to spy on the birthday party 
user1: I can't believe Toy Story is Pixar's first movie and that it was released 13 years ago.
user2: I know!! Tim Allen and Tom Hanks go really well together I think they really make the movie
user1: The film really captures what it feels like to be young and full of imagination. The idea that your toys all band together and spy on a party, communicating with baby monitors is really interesting.
user2: are there any other scenes that are interesting to you
user1: The scene where Buzz gets stuck in a crane game and Andy's neighbor, Sid, wins them is interesting.
user2: I like when they fall out of the car and get into the pizza planet truck.
user1: The conflict between Buzz and Woody is a great plot device and makes for a really interesting story.
user2: Yes. it makes you wonder if they will end up liking each other
user1: Pixar did a great job writing the Buzz character. Buzz thinking he's a real space ranger makes for an exciting story.
user2: what character is your favorite
user1: My favorite character is Woody. What is your favorite character?
user2: Bo Peep. shes not a main character but she is pretty cool
user1: Bo Peep is a great character. I love that they made Buzz fly on a rocket like a real space ranger.
user2: Yes that made it cool.I did not know that Sid's  dogs' name was Scud... I always thought it was Scott. 
user1: I don't remember Andy getting a puppy. I wonder why there weren't any cats in the movie.
user1: I wonder if Buzz and Woody would have still disliked each other if they weren't competing for Andy's affection.
