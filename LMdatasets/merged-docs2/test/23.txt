critical response:
is true to the spirit of [Monsters, Inc.] and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground.
It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result.
is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful.
This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.

description:
Michael 'Mike' Wazowski, a 7-year-old monster, aspires to become a scarer   a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy   when he grows up after visiting Monsters Inc., Monstropolis' most profitable scaring company, on a school field trip. Eleven years later, Mike is a first-year scare major at Monsters University, where he meets fellow monster, James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan. Mike studies hard, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, relies only on his natural ability and begins to falter. As the semester progresses, Mike and Sulley attempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the strongest fraternity on campus. At the semester's final exam, a fight between the two causes them to accidentally break Dean Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished Scream Can. Hardscrabble fails both of them immediately, stating that Sulley does not study enough, and Mike is not scary enough. 
Wanting to prove himself, Mike enters the university's 'Scare Games', and makes a wager with Hardscrabble to reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Mike must leave the university if they lose. He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, the weakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one team member short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program. Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. Oozma Kappa improve gradually due to Mike's training and intricate knowledge of scaring, and they advance through each following challenge, finishing just behind Roar Omega Roar. In the final round, they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom. However, Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley tampered with the machine's difficulty to the easiest setting. 
Mike and Sulley are led away by the CDA, and are expelled from the university as a result of their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the Games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck, claiming they were the first students to have surprised her. The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually working their way up to join the scarer team.

user2: Hi  What's up?
user2: I only see that you have entered the room.  Are we chatting?
user2: Are you there?
user1: Yes, sorry
user1: Have you seen Monsters University?
user2: Was almost ready to give up.
user1: I was reading the directions
user2: No is that a Pixar movie?
user1: Yes it's a Pixar movie from 2013
user2: okay and was it fun?
user1: Yes, it is a prequel for the Monsters Inc movie from 2001. It stars John Goodman and Billy Crystal as the main characters.
user2: All I can see is what you write
user2: oh two good actors   what happens in it?
user1: It's about the main characters, Mike and Silley. They are going on a school field trip.
user2: I take it that it's their voices
user1: Yes, they play the main characters. It's a computer animated movbie.
user2: And in a bus?
user2: what kind of antics do they do?
user1: Mike goes on a field trip to Monsters Inc on a school trip and decides he wants to be a scarer when he grows up. He goes to Monsters University when he grows up and meets Sulley.
user2: I think my screen has a delay and doesn't move very quickly
user1: I have to read the info they are providing and then tell you information about it, so it takes a few seconds for me to write
user2: a scarey?
user2: Okay so it's not me then?
user1: a scarer. Basically they harvest energy from scaring children at night.
user1: No it's not you
user2: oic  monsters under th bed kind of?
user1: So they join a fraternity on campus and try to enter the Scare Games, kind of like Hunger Games I guess.
user1: Yes, like that, or in a closet.
user2: okay I get the idea
user1: They have a hard time during the Scare Games and get disqualified.
user1: I'm sorry if this is not making sense. The plot seems a little ridiculous, lol
user2: what?  they don't know how to scare?
user2: I haven't seen it so lllll
user1: So, when they enter the Scare Games, one of them cheated, so they get disqualified. Sulley was the one who cheated. 
user2: I never go see this type of movie now that I don't have kids to go with me.
user1: They go to "college" to learn the best strategies to scare.
user2: now that is funny!
user1: I saw the first one and it was really good, but my kids were young then. Now I have no reason to see it.
user2: Well, I guess I have to go see for myself.  It's probably on TV somewhere.
user1: So, after they get disqulified from the Scare Games, they both take jobs at Monsters, Inc, in the mail room and they work their way up until they are able to join the "scarer team"
user1: It got 79% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: okay  bye now

conversation:
user1: Hello?
user2: great movie, isnt it?
user1: What movie are you talking about?
user2: Monsters University
user1: Ah right, I've heard it is good. What did you like about it?
user2: for sure i didnt whatch it. But According to the article It was realised by  Pixar
user1: Did it get better reviews than the original Monsters Inc?
user2: can you be more specific?
user1: Monsters University is a sequel, I wondered if it is better than the first movie
user2: unfortunately i didnt what the first
user2: and I didnt know it was a sequel
user1: Ok then... Does the article have any more information that you can tell me?
user2: the critics say it a colorful movie
user2: can you tell me what you think about that
user1: Does it say it is suitable for children?
user1: I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm trying to decide if I should watch it
user1: Is it a family movie?
user2: Oh okay
user2: I think so
user1: I wonder if my 4 year old would enjoy it? Maybe he's too young?
user1: If it's colorful and funny I think he will enjoy it. Did the article say it was a funny movie too?
user2: May be you would be afraid, because its  a monster movie
user1: Oh is it a scary movie?

user1: Thanks for your help :)
user2: Theres no problem

conversation:
user1: Hi there!
user2: Hello, have you seen Monsters University? 

conversation:
user1: Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone. 
user2: I agree.  It was a good movie
user1: What was your favorite part?
user2: I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.
user1: Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world. 
user2: Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.
user1: When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?
user2: I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.
user1: I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot. 
user2: I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.
user1: Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer? 
user2: I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.  
user1: I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?
user2: I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.
user1: That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!
user2: It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.
user2: Do you like Mike or Sulley better?
user1: Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic. 
user1: How about you?
user2: I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.
user1: He is SO funny!! 
user1: I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster
user2: The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.
user2: I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.
user1: Hahah I bet!!! 
user1: I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat
user2: Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.
user1: I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!
user1: It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke
user2: It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.
user1: I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.
user1: For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful! 
user2: I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.
user1: Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch
user2: And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.
user1: Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!
user1: It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody
user2: It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.
user1: Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far
user1: Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right
user2: I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.
user2: You've got a good point there about the cheating.
user1: And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!
user1: I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder

user2: Hello
user1:  Hi 
user1:  Looks like we got monsters University 
user2: Ok
user1:  I’ve never seen it 
user2: Me either
user2: I had picked the shape of water
user1:  I had home alone
user1: Lol
user2: I've seen that at least
user1:  It looks like Billy Crystal in the movie 
user2: Ok
user1:  It’s seem to do OK on rotten tomatoes I got a 79% 
user2: Yeah no kids so not great with kids movies
user2: That's pretty good
user1:  That’s OK I’ve got a bunch information from We can figure it out 
user2: 4 stars on umdb too
user2: imdb
user1:  Oh John Goodman‘s in this too and kind of suprised Steven buscemi  is in this 
user2: That's a good cast
user1: He normally plays really creepy bad guys
user2: Haha totally
user1:  Looks like monster Hunter has something like fraternity or sorority games called scary games 
user1:  Oops monsters University I’ve been playing monster Hunter sorry 
user1:  Maybe it’s to teach kids to challenge themselves 
user1: Oops did I lose you

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: HEY!
user1: What's the movie
user2: oh it's "Monster University"
user1: was that a Pixar film
user2: It is a comedy animation movie
user2: Nah!
user2: It was released in 2013
user1: who made it?
user1: I mean which company?
user2: Oh sorry It is actually a Pixar Animation movie
user2: Have you seen it before now?
user1: nope
user2: ok let me run you through the cast
user1: sure
user2: Billy Crystal as michael,
user1: he's good
user1: as an actor/entertainer
user2: John Goodmnan, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirem and peter sohn
user1: I'm surprised Helen Mirem was in it.
user2: Michael was a 7 year old monster in the movie
user2: and he aspires to be a scarer who enters human world at night to scare children
user1: interesting premise for a kids movie
user2: he went on to the University to be a scare major, there he met fellow scarer, sullivan
user2: they eventually formed a friendship thing but had to scatter after a fracas between them
user1: I don't want to break your train of thought, but what were the reviews
user1: or were the reviews good
user2: OK, I was just trying to give you the major hints, but about the reviews,
user2: rotten tomatoes; 79
user2: average 6.8 of 10
user2: metacritic; 65/100
user1: a little low, but not too bad
user2: while the cinema score is A
user2: I agree
user2: It was directed by Dan Scanion

conversation:
user2: It sounds like a good movie. It sounds like it is a good monsters inc successor.
user1: I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film. 
user1: Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?
user2: Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.
user2: And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.
user1: I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?
user2: Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or say its bad.
user1: Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it. 
user2: Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.
user2: Ya same.
user1: Comedy movies are always a must see in my book. 
user2: And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im "iffy" about.
user1: I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.
user2: Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.
user2: ya that name is great.
user1: He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later. So he'd be eighteen.
user1: I misread that at first too. 
user2: ahhh I see well that clears that up.
user1: Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities. 
user2: yep
user1: I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic. 
user2: Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.
user1: Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?
user2: ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.
user2: Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage? lol
user1: Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have? 
user2: idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.
user1: Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph. 
user2: yeah probably.
user2: Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.
user1: No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university. 
user2: Although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.
user2: Ah i see that would make sense.
user1: I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,. 
user2: True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.
user2: I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.
user2: Keep the kids on their toes.
user1: One can only hope. 
user2: And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.
user1: A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.
user2: Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.
user2: Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.

conversation:
user2: Hey, how are you?
user2: Do you like Monsters University?
user1: I do, I thought Billy did a good job as Mike
user2: Yeah Billy Crystal is great. Who is your favorite character?
user1: Mike was. Monster U is cute and funny and the animation, though not exactly inspired, has a lot of color.
user2: I really liked all the comedy in it. And the music
user1: The comedy is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground. The music hit all the right notes I think
user2: I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.
user2: Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.
user1: I agree, it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a good result.
user2: I liked the whole fraternity aspect of it, very tongue in cheek.
user1: Yes, it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters.
user2: I thought the scene of Mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too.
user1: I agree, I liked when they show Mike's background story of why he became a scarer. I always wondered why he chose to do that
user1: I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop
user2: Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that
user1: I didn't know Sully had such a pretentious background compared to other characters. It explains why only he was accepted into Roar Omega Roar.
user2: True, and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed.
user2: I thought the whole Scare Games plot was a fairly good one too, kept it interesting.
user1: I agree, I like that they didn't try to make them perfect. 
user1: Yes! And so much was at stake for them in that game as well
user1: It would decide if they could be renerolled or not. How do you feel about how Sully cheated?
user2: I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment.
user1: I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win
user2: I thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating.
user1: Yes I agree. It ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well
user2: I feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though.
user1: I agree and I think that it was a noble thing to do. At least they still were able to be hired at Monsters, Inc. and work their way up to becoming scarers.
user2: Yeah, guess it shows that you don't need education sometime! Haha.
user1: Exactly, sometimes all that's needed is preservation and hardwork!
user1: At least they didn't get in a lot of trouble with the CDA
user2: Yeah I was taken aback when Hardscrabble said they were the first students to surprise her.
user1: I agree, I thought they weren't too special. All in all it was a great movie!

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello.
user2: Have you seen Monster Ink?
user1: No. I have never heard of it.
user2: I mean Monsters University?
user1: Oh.
user1: I have not seen that.
user1: Is it new?
user2: It is a really good pixas ovie. With Bill Crystal and John Goodman as the main characters.
user1: What year was it released?
user2: No, it's rather old it came out in 2013.
user1: Was it a sequel?
user2: Yes, this is ... but more like the Pre-sequel.
user2: Because It goes back in time before, Monster Ink,
user1: Monsters, Inc. was the first movie?
user2: Yes, it was.
user1: Is it as good as Wall-E?
user1: Or is it more suited for children?
user2: Basically this one is about them going to school, and earning a degree in scaring.
user2: Well I think children.
user1: Is it better than the first movie?
user2: Nope, not to me at least. It just shows how Mike Wazowski and Sulley meet
user1: Hmm.
user2: One being a nerd and the other the 'jock'
user1: So, I should watch the first movie before this?
user2: Well no.. You can watch this one before, because this happens as young adults/teens.
user2: The director is Dan Scanton.
user1: It sounds interesting. I like most Pixar movies.
user1: Did it make you cry at any point?
user2: No, I don't think it is sad, it just more about how a odd friendship between two complete different people occurs.
user2: Mike isn't a scary enough monster, so Sulley is like his partner in crime
user1: I will watch it if I can find it on any streaming services.
user1: Thank you.
user2: Yea, check it out!

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hello!
user1: What movie would you like to talk about?
user2: Do you like to watch animated movies? Like this, Monster University?
user1: I do! What is it about?
user2: It's about monsters being thought on how to scare people.
user1: Is it as good as the prequel?
user2: Yes, I think so, it's also made by Pixar, so I guess you will like it if you enjoyed Monsters Inc.
user1: I did enjoy it quite a bit. Is there anything bad about it?
user2: Most of the critics enjoyed it, they said it's colorful, cute and funny, but the story is generic, predictable. But I think it's not that bad. It's really hard to say anything negative about this movie.
user1: That is really encouraging to hear. Sometimes a predictable movie is nice to watch. Would you say it's one of your favorite Pixar movies?
user2: Not my favorite actually, but it's definitely a good re watch. Something to enjoy through those boring rainy days.
user1: It sounds like a movie I would probably be interested in. Are you generally a fan of animated movies?
user2: Yes, I generally love watching animated movies and series, I would easily admire cool graphics. Are you interested in animated movies with animals or creatures in it?
user1: Yes, those kinds of movies are usually the best. Do you think that adults would enjoy this movie as much as children?
user2: Not all adults I guess, especially those who do not appreciate animation. How about companies that make these animated movies, do you have any opinions about them? Like Pixar for example, I think they have improved over these years.
user1: I agree. I think Pixar is far better than Dreamworks at this point, but Dreamworks still makes decent quality movies
user2: Yes I think they are both good. Oh and by the way, I would like to add that I am trying to avoid sad movies, you know like Marley and Me, to be honest, I still haven't watched that movie.
user1: I haven't watched that movie either. I am pretty sensitive to movies, especially horror, so I avoid most of them, which is why I'm so into animated movies. Are you easily scared by movies?
user2: I don't actually, I find them a bit boring now, especially the gory-disgusting ones. But if it has a good story in it I would watch it. I just hate it when they are just trying to use "screamers" just to surprise their audience and say "this is the most frightening movie ever".
user1: I agree. Jump scares are what I don't like, in addition to gore. But horror with a decent plot is okay. They're few and far between though. Monsters University isn't scary, thank goodness
user2: A very good example of horror movie that I liked would be The Autopsy of Jane Doe. I think it's a really creative movie, they only used like 5 characters in it, the scenes literally happened in one place, but it's full of twists. The movie will make you think every second of it without using too much gore or predictable jump scares.
user1: Thank you for the recommendation! I haven't heard of that one. I haven't seen many horror films in general because they're what I avoid. Do you like the newer Disney, non pixar movies? 
user2: Yes, although I can't really remember of which is which. Kung fu Panda was entertaining, and also the Lego movies, it was really creative.
user1: I really enjoyed Moana, more than Frozen. Kung fu Panda and Lego movies were really good as well.
user2: I still haven't watched Moana and Frozen, but I am really planning to. Why do you think Moana is a lot better than Frozen?
user1: I love Frozen, but Moana just has an energy to it that Frozen lacks. Hard to explain!

conversation:
user1: I didn't know Billy Crystal was the voice of Mike but I love it!
user1: Steve Buscemi is in this too?
user2: Yes he is! I'm guessing you've seen Monsters University?
user1: I did when it came out years ago, just never thought to look at the voice acting.
user1: When did you see it?

conversation:
user2: Hey have you seen Monster's University (2013)?
user1: I think my girls have seen it. I'm not so sure that I have.
user1: What's it about?
user2: You should watch it. It is a prequel of Monster's Inc, it shows how Mike and Sully started off as rivals at the same university.
user1: Ok - is it funny?
user2: It is 3D animated and has a few jokes in there for the adults. It is very funny.
user1: Is it only in 3D?
user2: Yes. It isn't the kind of 3D with glasses, it is 3D computer animated like most Pixar movies.
user1: Oh.  Ok - so does Mike still try to scare kids in this one?
user1: Or is it just about them being in school?
user2:  Mike is trying. He is more book smart than street smart like Sully. 
user1: Does it talk about how things are in their homes that may be different?
user1: Like with their parents/siblings, etc.?
user2: They are just in school until the end, it shows them where we started off in the Monsters Inc movie. 
user2: Yes, you get to see a little bit of home life and how they differ.
user1: Many sequels/prequels aren't as good as the original - how does this one rank?
user2: I say a 10/10. It really flows with the original. 
user1: that's unusual many times - good to hear.  Do you know if the same voice actors portray Mike and Sully?
user1: As in Monsters Inc.
user2: It matches the tone of the movie. The same actors do portray Mike and Sully. 
user1: Why do they not like each other at first?
user2: They do have different voice actors to portray the younger versions, like grade school versions.
user1: oh - i understand.
user2: Mike is jealous of Sully because he has a natural ability to scare, whereas Mike has to study.
user1: why are they rivals in this movie?
user1: ah - i see!  Do they eventually work through that before the movie ends?
user2: They are rivals because Mike is jealous of Sully and wants to beat him using his brain.
user2: The movie ends with them as best friends heading into Monster's Inc
user1: does anything unexpected happen in the movie?
user2: Yes! When the dean of students expells Mike but Mike won't take no for an answer. Then creates a scare team to compete on campus. 
user1: How does that play out?  

conversation:
user2: Hey!! 
user1: Hey

user1: yes
user2: My computer froze :(
user2: So sorry about that.
user1: Itsall good
user1: Have you heard of monsters INC?
user2: I have! I thought that was a pretty good kids movie.
user2: I'm not usually into animated films but it was actually decent.
user1: Cool! This movie is the prequel
user1: its the first prequel pixar ever made
user2: Oh really?
user1: I would recomend it fo shizzle
user2: I didn't know that.
user2: Haha nice
user1: Helen miran is in it too
user2: Oh cool.
user2: She's a pretty good actress.

user1: his voice is classic
user2: Is he still alive?
user1: I think so
user1: yea i saw him not so long ago
user1: on tv
user2: Oh haha I thought you actually saw him
user2: I was like whaaaaa craaaazy

user1: i never saw comercials forit or anything
user2: Oh, we're done. Have a good one!
user1: it was made in 2013
user1: You to!!

conversation:
user2: Hi! Today we'll be discussing Monsters university!
user1: Cool! What's it about? 
user1: What's the movie about? 
user2: It's a Pixar computer animated comedy about two monsters: Mike and Sully and they're time spent studying at college, starting off as rivals and eventually becoming frienda. Have you ever seen Monsters Inc?
user1: Yeah, Monsters Inc. was a good movie, but it's been a long time since I've seen it. Is the new one a prequel then? 
user2: Yes, it's a prequel to the original! In fact, it's the first prequel ever made by Pixar!
user1: That's cool. Do you think it's a good movie? Sometimes sequels and prequels kind of stink.
user2: I thought it was cute and funny! Cinemascore gave it a rating of A - and I can't help but agree with that score!
user1: What was cute about it? Was it as good as the first movie? 
user2: I'd say it's definitely true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches it's tone. As far as the cute aspect, it has that Pixar animation cuteness to it. Plus you'll recognize a lot of the voices!
user1: Very cool. Is Billy Crystal voicing Mike again? He's hilarious 
user2: He is and he did a great job! It's quite funny because the film starts out on Mike as a 7 year old monster who dreams of becoming a "scarer" after visiting Monsters Inc!
user1: Aw, that's pretty cute. I assume they don't have any cute humans in this one though, since that would kind of spoil the plot of the original. 
user2: True. It primarily focuses on the monsters but it does touch a little on how they harvest the human screams for energy - 11 years later, Mike finds himself as a first  "scare major" at Monsters university and that's where he meets the privileged Sulley.
user1: So is "scare major" like a subject you can major in at the university, or is it like a military rank kind of major? 
user2: It's a subject you major in at the university. In fact, Sulley came from a family of talented scarers but unfortunately relies on his natural ability and begins to falter.
user1: Cool cool. So is it kind of a story where they come from different backgrounds and each teach each other valuable lessons? 
user2: Yeah basically in a sense. For instance at one point, they are both failed by the dean who claims Sulley does not study enough while Mike isn't scary enough.
user1: Ah interesting. So, do you think adults would enjoy this movie, or is it more geared toward kids? 
user2: I tbink it's a comedy/animation that people of all ages would enjoy! It has humor, friendship and overcoming the odds!
user1: Very interesting. What's the run time? 
user2: I don't honestly know but it's worth every minute! My favorite scene which I think you would also enjoy is when Mike enters the university's "scare games", making a wager with the dean to reinstate he and his team if they win!
user1: Cool, why is that your favorite scene? 
user2: It's heartwarming and humorous at the same time because he joins up with a group of misfits who are members of the weakest fraternity on campus. Mike trains the misfit and they eventually win. But mike learns they only won the final round because Sulley tampered with the machine's difficulty setting.
user1: So Sully is friends with Mike at that point? 
user2: They are and they're led away and expelled by the university. As Mike is leaving on the bus, there's a touching moment as Sulley runs after him to lift his spirits. Eventually, they both land a job at Monsters Inc and work their way up to the scarer team!
user1: Very neat. Do you know where I could watch Monster's University? Is it still in theaters? On netflix? 
user2: It came out in 2013 so it's an older film. I strongly encourage you and your family to give it a watch if you're able to find it! Are you a fan of John Goodman by chance?
user1: He's alright. Monster's Inc. is probably my favorite of his movies. 
user2: He returns again as Sulley in Monsters university! Steve Buscemi also voices the character of Randy Boggs in the film!
user1: Was Randy Boggs in the original? I can't remember
user2: He was and Steve reprised the role in this one. Well I enjoyed discussing Monsters university with you! I strongly encourage you and your family to give it a watch! Have a great day!
user1: You too, thanks : )

conversation:
user2: Hey how are you?
user1: Hi! hows it going?
user2: Good, just got done watching Monsters University, such a cute movie!
user1: Yeah? What is it about?
user2: Its a cartoon, have you seen Monsters Inc?
user1: Yeah, I thought it was a good movie.
user2: Its the prequel to Monsters Inc. It is about the two main characters' time in college! Mike and Sulley
user1: Do you think it is as good as Monsters Inc?
user2: No, I think its a cute movie but I have to agree with the critics, it isn't always best to turn over old ground
user1: What rating did the critics give the movie?
user2: It averaged 6.8/10 and 79% on Rotten Tomatoes. Sometimes you just cant do as good as the first movie I guess
user2: Its shows the story of them studying in scare school. Mike and Sulley start off as rivals.
user1: OK. What made the movie not as good? Was it the character development, the plot, etc?
user2: The plot. I think its hard to follow the story, knowing how the two end up working together and being best friends!
user2: Mike works hard in school while Sulley is is privileged, coming from a family of talented scarers. So they don't start off on good terms
user1: Yeah, Im not sure if that part of monster Inc needed a whole movie to develop the character relationship. I havent heard much about the movie, so I guess that means it was really popular.
user2: They actually both fail Monsters University in the beginning of the movie. 
user1: But they were able to get right back in?
user2: Well, Mike enters the "scare games" in which he can either get reinstated or leave for good.  
user2: He joins the weakest fraternity, Oozma Kappa. Sulley ends up joining the team too.
user1: Is that like a knock off of the Hunger Games or gladiator style fighting?
user2: Gladiator style, challenges they have to do. They all work together to get through the challenges and do really well. Mike & Sulley seem to form a bond, until the final round
user1: So a predictable relationship fallout that resolves by the end of the movie. 
user1: Would you recommend the movie?
user1: If so, what age group would enjoy the movie?
user2: Mike gets upset because Sulley tampered with a machine in a simulation room. He sets it to the easiest setting so they win. 
user2: I think kids will enjoy it! My daughters 2 & 4 love it.
user2: But in the end, they end up making up and actually taking jobs at Monsters, Inc. In the mail room
user1: So I guess it is a PG movie?
user2: Definitely PG!
user2: I rarely enjoy sequels or prequels but this one is a cute kids movie. 
user1: OK, Ill have to keep that in mind as my son gets old enough to watch movies.
user2: I think he will enjoy. Cant go wrong with Pixar movies!
user1: I think that your summary will be very helpful in further deciding if and when to see it.
user2: I'm glad!!

conversation:
user2: Have you watched Monsters University
user1: Do you agree with the rating of 6.8 for the movie?
user1: Yes I have multiple times, have you?
user2: I would rate it higher than that I really enjoyed it
user1: I did as well, I think it's a great movie, and my kids love it.
user2: It has a lot of big names doing the voices. My grandson loved it two
user1: Do you like John Goodman, that voices Sulley?
user1: Also, who is your favorite character in the movie?
user2: He is perfect for it. I find that the voices sometimes match the way the stars look
user2: The music is awesome two. Randy Newman does a lot of the music for animation movies. Think he did Toy Story as well. Billy Crystal does a great job as well
user1: Yes, I know there are a few voices similar.  The music is great for both of them as well!
user2: I really enjoy how they make the animated movies now. They include some jokes for the adults
user1: Me too, they really have been doing a great job.
user1: Do you agree with any of the critical responses?
user2: The plot is good two. Tiny little Mikey trying to become a scary monster.
user1: I don't see anything about the little girl in the movie, on the page. She's a big part of it, too.
user2: Yes they seem about right. It was a good balance in the movie. Also taught a good lesson.
user2: I know I was looking for that as well she is a key part. Loved that they called her Boo
user1: I thought it was really original, especially when it came out.
user1: Yeah, I loved her part in the movie.
user2: I liked the Scare Games and how it taught lessons on perserverance and confronting fears
user2: The producers are good at hiding valuable lessons
user1: Have you watched the Prequel, Monsters University as well?
user1: I did, too.
user2: I did I just loved all the characters. It was well done
user1: Do you think it was a good setting story for Monsters inc?
user2: I thought Monsters U was a good follow up to Monster Inc.
user2: I can't remember where Monsters Inc took place. I get them kind of blurred together
user1: I think it's the CDC?

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Good morning.
user2: have you seen Monsters University?
user1: No. I haven't
user2: Oh, I thought you had seen it
user1: Maybe bits and pieces over the years.
user1: I'm aware of the characters though.
user1: 79% rotten tomatoes, not bad.
user2: Oh okay
user2: Yes, I recently saw it and it was really funny
user2: Billy Crystal is one of the stars
user2: Well star voices that is
user2: It also has John Goodman
user1: I like animation movies
user2: It's actually a sequel believe it our not
user1: I know that, it's called Monsters right?
user2: Monsters Inc 
user1: Oh right
user2: It also has music by Randy Newman
user2: he does a lot of the Pixar movies
user1: I like how they gave him an age even though he's a monster.
user2: John Ratzenberger is in it as well
user1: I like Pixar.
user1: What's the story line of the movie?
user2: Yes
user2: It's a prequel to Monsters Ince
user2: it goes back to when Mike and Sully are in college
user2: they're rivals at first
user2: but then they become friemnds
user2: friends
user1: And they're basically just going to school?
user1: Any drama?
user2: Going to University
user2: Yes, there's drama and comedy
user2: It's very true to the Monsters Inc spirit
user2: same type of feel
user1: I'll have to watch it some time.
user2: Yes, the first one came out in 2001
user2: Monsters U came out in 2013
user2: that's a 12 year gap
user1: wow, makes me feel old
user2: crazy
user2: Yes, all of us
user1: I wonder why they took so long to make another one
user2: No idea
user2: Here's another interesting fact
user2: Bonnie Hunt, who played Ms.Flint in the first film, voices Mike's grade school teacher Ms. Karen Graves.
user2: Well I hope you have a good day
user2: A pleasure to talk to you

conversation:
user2: hey

user1: has okay scores on the ratings 79 on rotten tomatoes
user2: well it has that eyeball character
user1: haha yeah it did
user1: i think that might of been squibbles? 
user2: oh that seems like pretty good score
user1: i'm not sure tho
user1: cinema score gave it an A so thats good
user1: they say it was similiar to the first one and good for  a sequel so that's good
user2: yeah agree
user1: i guess you also dont need to see number 1 to see this one either
user1: so the storyline must not really continue i guess.
user1: this movie was from 2013- so it's hard to believe its already 5 years old
user2: yeah time flies, lots of movies, this one sounds pretty decent though
user1: Some good characters for the voices too. john goodman, billy crystal
user1: same as the first ones i suppose
user2: good actors
user1: i would probably watch this movie. might even be on netflix possibly or prime
user2: the voice seems made for movies
user1: very true. it's nice when they fit
user2: will check out on netflix
user2: hope its funny, sound like it
user1: me too!  and probably for the first one too
user1: it does seem to be funny based on the document i believe
user1: was the first one funny?
user2: yes, i sort of dont remember it very well though
user2: so, maybe?
user1: it most likely is the genre is comedy i just noticed lol

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: What movie is this?
user1: Hi
user1: Monsters University is the movie. It's very funny and I highly suggest it if you like kids movies.
user1: You will like this movie if you have seen the original Monsters Inc.
user1: I have recently seen this movie and I enjoyed it.

conversation:
user1: have you watch monsters university?
user2: No is it a good movie
user1: yea its a good follow up to the original
user1: it tells the backstory of the main monsters when they go to college
user2: I saw the first one.
user2: Is it the same monsters
user2: It looks like billy crystal was one of the voices
user1: mostly the main characters
user1: john goodman is in it too
user2: Oh John Goodman sometimes does some funny stuff
user1: yea
user2:  It looks like it came out to mixed reviews 65 out of 100 or 6.8 out of 10 seems pretty low especially for an animated movie but I guess rotten tomato thought it was OK 
user1: they gave it a good score
user1: at least we get to see when mike first meets sully
user2:  How did they first meet ?
user1: at mosters university
user1: they both aspire to be a scarer
user2:  Did they share a dorm together something like that 
user1: but sulley is better and gerts accepted into the good frat
user1: yea
user2: Oh that’s seems like a good story line
user2:  I didn’t realize Helen Mirren was in this that’s pretty cool 
user2: Looks like scare games is like  I fraternity or sorority competition week is that about with the scary games were like 
user2: Are you still there?
user1: sorry

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi.  Monsters University is an animated film.  Do you like animated films?
user2: Hello. Is there anybody in there?? 

conversation:
user2: Did you think Steve Buscemi did a good job as the role of Randall?
user1: I do, I think he played a great evil guy. 
user1: Did you enjoy Monsters University better then Monsters Inc?
user1: Are you still there? 

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you?
user1: Good, just finished watching Monsters Inc.  Great movie
user1: oh sorry, monster university
user1: Have you seen it yet?
user2: I haven't see it yet, it is the prequel of Monsters Inc?
user1: Yes, where mike and sully learned how to be scare monsters!
user2: Alright, do you know its rating on Rotten Tomatoes? 
user1: It's got some decent scores.  Rotten tomatoes only give it a 6.8, but I loved how it stayed true to the movie without redoing any old info
user1: I agree with Cinema Score:  A!
user1: Are you watching the movie now?
user2: Ok, it sounds great! So, you just have watched the movie. What was your favorite scene?
user2: No, I think I might watch it this weekend with my family!
user1: There are just too many too list!  to quote the critics, it's cute, and funny and the animation is really colorful
user2: Awesome, Pixar always delivers great films without any doubt.
user1: might?  you're family will love it if they liked Monster's INC!
user1: I got a kick out of Sully which doesn't study enough and poor mike, just isn't scary enough
user2: I might because my schedule is quite tight, so I always try to save some time to spend it with my family!
user2: Poor Mike, but well he always tried his best and that also counts!
user1: This will be worth the time to spend with them.  Yup!  Mike starts off as just a 7 year old when he wants to be a scarer!
user1: He wants to prove himself, so he makes a wager with Hardscrabble.  Win, scare team is on.  Lose, and he has to join the misfit group.  =(   I won't tell you how it ends!
user2: That sounds like the old little me, when I say I wanted to become a doctor!
user2: That is surely enough! You got convinced to watch it!
user1: Well for monsters, being a scare tech is quite the achievement.  Doctors wouldn't even have electricity without them.  
user1: That's awesome!  
user1: The movie sells itself!  Is there a finish conversation box on your end?
user2: Yes, being a scarer it is a job with great recognition!
user2: Do you think the prequel was at the same level as Monsters Inc? Or was even better?
user1: I guess just a few more rounds of conversation.  Key scenes include Mike and Sully being expelled!  you know those too.
user1: Fot a prequel it was actually good.  They "stay in tone" but don't hit old topics,  it really does fit
user2: Oh that is quite a plot twist, do they achieve to return after being expelled?
user1: of course, thanks to mike!
user1: He really is the hero of the movie, although he secretly has sully's help all along
user2: That sense of friendship is always nice to see! It makes feel hope in people.
user2: Well, thanks for the conversation, have a great day!
user1: You too, enjoy the moive!

conversation:
user2: Hey
user1: Hi!
user2: I haven’t watched the movie
user1: Okay, well Monster's University is a pretty good movie. It's definitely one you should check out. 
user1: Have you ever seen Monster's Inc?
user2: I did see monsters inc
user2: It was fairly nice
user1: Okay well Monster's University carries the same tone and humor of the first movie.
user2: As expected 
user1: It's a good sequel.
user2: Ohh what is it about though 
user1: Okay so in the beginning you get to see Mike as a young monster. You can see how he really wants to be a scarer when he wants to grow up. Eventually he gets to Monster's University.
user1: That's where he meets Sully.
user2: Oh great
user2: I suppose sully is a small girl
user2: Does she get scared?
user1: Sulley is the big blue monster from the first movie. Initially they aren't very good friends. 
user2: Oh okay
user2: I got confused
user1: Sulley comes from a family of scarer's and it is expected that he will be a good scary monster when he finishes school so he has some pressure on him. He feels like he has to prove himself, but he's not very good at school.
user2: Oh great
user2: Does he actually become successful?
user1: He joins a group of misfit monsters in a fraternity called Oozma Kappa. Mike is apart of that fraternity. They are nice monsters, but not very scary.
user1: Well there is a big challenge that all the fraternity's participate in. Whoever wins gets a trophy and all. 
user1: Mike and Sulley, and the rest of Oozma Kappa want to win so that they will prove themselves to be the scariest monsters. Sulley is not a very good team player at first though.
user2: Oh alright 
user2: So this challenge consists of different tasks
user2: And to complete it they have to use different strategies 
user1: Yes! Mike has different strategies for each task, however Sulley feels like Mike he is not a very scary monster they won't win. So he cheats.
user1: They are caught and expelled.
user2: Oh 
user2: So they lose their education 
user1: Yes they are kicked out of monsters university.
user1: But since Mike and Sulley became friends, they decide to work together.
user1: You find out that Sulley only cheated to help Mike win because it was so important to him.
user1: They decided to work in the mail room of Monsters Inc, the scaring company, and eventually work their way up to being a scaring team. This movie ends where the first movie begins.

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hey!
user1: Do you like animated movies?
user2: Oh! I love animated movies
user1: Me too. Especially Pixar.
user2: Pixar has never failed to touch my heart, emotionally
user2: Inside-Out and Up are my favorites
user2: what are yours?
user1: Up and Toy Story
user2: do you agree with the critics' view of this movie?
user1: Pretty much. It was a cashgrab.
user2: exactly hahaha
user2: a mere cash-grab
user2: It was enjoyable, but it can never be Monsters Inc.
user2: it was just a "passable" movie
user1: Definitely not.
user1: Yeah. And they said they knew each other from childhood in Inc
user1: So meeting in college is pretty dumb
user2: The plot wasn't really well-though out
user1: I agree. 
user1: It's sad to see awesome actors in crappy movies. I love John Goodman, but he does a lot of bad movies.
user2: yeah, I couldn't agree more
user1: Oh, new key scene
user2: so, you don't really agtee with Rotten Tomatoes's 79% review?
user2: agree*
user1: No, it's too high for sure
user1: Metacritic is more accurate
user2: it's funny, because Interstellar (in my opinion, the best Sci-Fi movie ever made) is 74%
user1: Yeah, ratings are pretty ridiculous. I hate when movies I love get skipped over because some reviewers didn't like it.
user2: despite all of this, I don't think we're gonna see less of these "cash-grab" movies from Pixar and Disney
user1: No, definitely more coming
user2: I mean, Cars 2 and Cars 3
user2: enough said hahahaha
user1: Planes even got two sequels. PLANES! Lol

user1: I was surprised Pixar decided to make a sequel. Didn't think they would ever do that
user1: Not sure Monster's Inc. was their best choice to follow up on.
user2: i know it defiantly took awhile  
user2: almost unexpeced
user2: a nice supprise nevertheless
user1: I know fraternities are a big part of college, but I wish they would have not included it in this movie.
user2: how come?
user2: youve got my curiosity 
user1: I didn't feel it was appropriate for children to be exposed to "hazing" no matter what form they portrayed it in.
user2: agreed however disney is imfamous for sneaking in even subliminally,inappropriate content  
user1: It was fun to see sully and mike develop into great friends though
user1: Breaking the cherished scream can of the dean was epic!
user2: yeah most defiantly 
user2: have you ever seen the little mermaid or the original cover art before it was revised?
user1: sully really has a good heart. It was very kind of him to tamper with the machine in the Omega Roar competition
user1: Yes. Terrible
user2: yeah,it kind of makes you wonder who they have working for Disney,allot of controversy follows their name,i do love the classics though!
user1: I must reiterate that I'm not please with this movie as a whole. The emphasis on fraternaties and the need to fit in just to graduate is frustrating.
user2: i use too love playing Aladdin on the snes and sega 
user2: i couldnt agree with that more
user2: i mean is supposed too be a movie not social condition g 
user1: If they had just not entered the frat, and just been themselves and focused on their studies, I don't think there would have been any controversy.
user1: It is a movie though, and there has to be some sort of story line.
user1: Glad they were given pats on the back by Hardscrabble.
user2: although  their is al lot  of deep meaning and subliminal content behind their movies when in fact they are supposed to set a wholesome depiction of life 
user2: how do you feel about the ratings i think rotten tomatoes can be rather harsh?
user1: Seems like they want to push the group thinking and eliminate individualism. Why couldn't they have succeeded in College without all of the hazing antics? 
user1: They want us to think only low life college drop outs get mail room jobs.
user2: right!!
user2: i know,social conditioning at its finest 
user1: I think those ratings are pretty accurate considering the masses
user2: most of the worlds billionaires never spent a day in collage 
user1: It was a happy ending with Sully and Mike solidifying their friendship in order to take the whole system down in Monsters, Inc.
user2: yes i remeber the ending was very well dine and satisfying 
user1: mike and sully make a great team
user2: im a big gamer and music addict and tbh it takes allot for me to finish or sit through a movie and i did with this one 
user1: I find it interesting that mike was only seven years old when he was able to be certain about his future career, and he stuck with it no matter what challenges he faced.
user1: $2. i know
user2: i have always loved john goodman as well  i forgot to mention that 
user2: he was a perfect match for his role
user1: John Goodman has always been a favorite of mine. very versitile
user1: agreed
user2: absoulutely
user1: His warm, yet gruff voice really fit sully well
user2: it will be a sad day when  he passes 
user1: don't speak it into existence. He's lost a lot of weight and seems really happy
user2: oh yes im well  aware and happiness creates longevity 
user1: Hardscrabble was well named. She was pretty rough on mike and sully when they broke her scream can
user2: LOL she was a bit harsh on  them
user1: Dan Scanion did well in directing this animated film
user2: yes very much,are you aware of  any other films hes done?
user1: No...
user2: me niether 
user1: Oozma Kappa is a pretty creative name for a frat
user2: however he hit this one out of  the park 
user2: yeah i always liked that name alot 
user1: Roar Omega Roar I don't like nearly as much
user1: Hardscrabble really took a 180 wishing them luck
user1: in the end
user2: i used to have a freind with the nickname sully it reminds me of  him  when i hear sully from the movie
user1: last name sullivan?
user2: yes 
user1: nice
user2: an old roomate 
user2: yeah he was a cool dude 
user1: I can't agree with the CinemaScore of A. I would give this a C myself.
user2: yeah agreed 
user1: Think we met the criteria of the turk?
user2: you always have  such  mixed reviews with big titles such  as this 
user1: well no one wants to give a kids movie a bad review. It keeps the kids entertained. It can't be all bad, right???
user2: i can say so,i think im going to watch this movie again tonight 
user2: no ofcourse not 

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello, We just saw Monsters University, it was great. 
user2: Let's chat!
user2: Nice to know that you've watched Monsters University.
user1: I highly recommend it, it has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 6.8/10.
user2: Unfortunately, I haven't watched that movie.
user1: Billy Crystal plays the voice of Mike, one of the main characters (monsters).
user2: Is he your favorite character in that movie?
user1: I also like John Goodman as the voice of Sulley, he does a good job.
user2: Who is the director of this movie?
user1: It is directed Dan Scanlon.
user2: What year does this movie released?
user1: The movie was released in 2013. 
user2: What is the genre of this movie?
user1: It is an animated comedy, produced by Pixar Animation Studios. 
user2: Great! Looks like you know a lot about this movie. 
user1: The premise is great. The monster Mike, wants to become a scarier monster, so the movie is about how he tries to scare more kids than the other monsters.
user2: Really interesting! Who are the characters in this movie?
user1: Like I said, Mike is one of the main characters that partners with the other monster, Sulley, in a contest against the other monster teams to try to become the scariest monsters. They enter childrens' rooms at night and scare them. They get energy by the children's screams.
user2: When was the last time you watched this movie?
user1: Just recently, you should really check it out. One of the other monster teams was disqualified and the movie goes through the monsters' stories as they are in the contest.
user2: Is that your favorite part of the movie?
user1: One of my favorite scenes is when Mike learns that the only reason he won is because Sulley tampered with the machine's difficulty level by making it the easiest setting.
user2: Oh reall? Looks like you enjoyed watching this movie. Who is the producer of this movie?
user1: It is produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It is sad when Mike and Sulley are expelled and led away by the CDA for tampering with the machine.
user2: Do you agree with the 79% ratings of Rotten Tomatoes in this movie?
user1: I like the review that says, "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful". I agree with that, it is a safe movie for families.
user2: Great! Who is the MAIN character in this movie? Who is the voice talent or dubber of that character?
user1: Mike and Sulley are main characters. Mike leaves on the bus and Sulley runs after him to try to raise his spirits.
user2: Great! Thanks for a nice conversation

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hey
user1: have you seen this movie before
user2: Have you seen this movie before?
user1: lol! 
user1: Yes, I have
user1: you?
user2: I have not seen it, I know it's been around for a while but my kids never got interested! Was it good?
user1: It was
user2: I see it only has 6.8/10 rating
user2: so that's pretty good
user1: It's pretty similar to the first one I thought
user2: Really? I never saw either one, but the characters looked pretty cute, I see they have Billy Crystal and Helen Mirren
user1: this one goes through how mike and sulley met
user1: Yes, the voices are great
user1: the characters are very vivid and brightly colored
user1: my kids really like this movie
user2: Well my 12 year old would not be interested any longer but my 4 year old might:-), I guess I'll try to watch it with him:-)
user1: I have a 4 and 7 year old
user2: and the 4 year old liked this movie?
user1: it goes over how we can overcome our differences and be friends with those who are different
user2: That's a good lesson!
user1: He did! 
user1: It had a great lesson.
user2: I'll definitely give it a try then!:-)
user2: Not a whole a lot of things he is interested in right now
user2: maybe he'll watch it
user1: There are parts that are a little scary. Because the do try to scare kids for the screams, but its not a dark twisted scary 
user1: if that makes any sense 
user1: I liked it! lol
user2: I know what you mean, I think this might be ok, it looks very vivid and bright, like a fun movie!
user1: Yes, there are some really funny parts to it too
user2: Good-a nice change from all the latest super heroes and dark apocalyptic stuff!
user1: OMG, yes!!!
user2: I don't know how many more Thor movies or Marvel movies i can take! lol:-)
user1: And they all turn out with the same ending!

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hello
user2: I was thinking about Monsters University
user1: That's a great movie.
user2: I really loved that movie
user2: Reminded me of the feel of Monsters Inc
user1: Glad you did, I saw it too and it was good.
user2: What did you like the most about it?
user1: When they broke the scare meter.
user1: Because of the strategy of the little guy and the scariness of his big blue friend.
user2: The one that belonged to the principal?
user1: Yes, that's the one.
user2: That was an interesting scene, and with how the principal talked to them after that
user2: Very interesting turning point
user1: Yes, they were useless as individuals but very good as a team, sort of unstoppable!
user2: Thats one of the reasons I loved the movie. It really showed how they became close and how each had a weakness that turned into a strength for the other
user1: Yes, that was very good.  What were the critical acclaims?
user2: Cinemascore gave it an A, reasonably
user2: and rotten tomatoes gave it a 79% tomato score
user1: Overall pretty high scores.
user2: Hard to be a bad movie when Disney and Pizar make a movie
user1: Yes they are perfectionists probably.   A lot goes into it even by hollywood standards.
user1: Who were some of the voice actors?
user2: Mike Wazowski, the green monster, was done by Billy Crystal
user2: John Goodman was the blue monster, Sully
user1: Who was the voice actress for the Principal?
user1: or dean rather
user2: Helen Mirren
user2: I dont know what else she was in but she did sound familiar
user1: Well a lot of big names in the voice actors indeed.
user2: Billy Crystal and John Goodman are the main actors that I recognize
user2: It's hard to imagine any other actor doing their roles
user1: Yes those are big names
user1: Ok thanks I'll go watch it again.  Ciao!

conversation:
user2: hello, this is my first time doing this but It looks like 6.8 out of 10 people enjoyed this movie 
user1: Hello, so did you like the movie Monster's University? Did you think it was as good as Monsters inc. 
user1: It's my first time also.  
user1: Yes, it seems Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 79%. 
user2: I think the movie was okay I believe the original was better but that could be because of the age gap when both movies where made 
user1: Who was your favorite character?  I like Sulley. 
user2: it's cool that this one was offered in 3D 
user1: Yes the 12 year difference between the first and second movie made it difficult for some people to remember the previous movie. 
user2: yeah it was hard to forget my little sister literally watched it 100 times 
user1: I also thought it was interesting that this movie showed the relationship between Mike and Sulley prior to monsters  inc. 
user2: yes that is a different perspective for sure 
user2: it's also cool it showed the monsters when they where younger as well
user1: So I can see how Mike doesn't have what it really takes for scaring the kids. 
user1: Sully definitely has more of a scare factor and I can see why he was able to join Roar Omega Roar. 
user2: yes and only sulley made it in the roar sorority 
user2: they got into a fight because of it 
user2: and broke the cherished scream can
user1: Yes, I think that it shows that even with talent you have to work hard to be successful as sully failed when he didn't study enough. 
user2: but all in all, they both had their pros and cons Sulley never studied and mike wasn't scary enough 
user2: yes lol 
user2: mike joined the weakest sorority 
user1: Mike wanted to be scary he just didn't have it in him, he only won the game as Sully changed the difficulty level to easiest. 
user1: IT was lucky that they made it to the next round due to a team cheating that left them disqualified. 
user2: yup sulley tampered with the machine
user1: Sulley joined Mike's team also as a way to get back into the scare program after failing out. 
user1: It was great how they beat roar omega roar at the end even if it was due to tampering of the machine. 
user2: yeah I agree 
user2: they got led away by the cda
user2: and become expelled
user1: Yeah it's a bummer that they both were kicked out of school. 
user1: they had to start over at monster's inc in the mail room and worked up to being scarer's. 
user2: yeah but that's how they made their way to monsters ink is because they got kicked out 
user2: and they worked in the mail center at first 
user2: but than made their way to the scare team  
user1: Yes, unfortunately the rest of the team, was able to go into the scare program. 
user2: yup overall I think the scene selection was mild and slow compared to the original 
user1: I think it's hard to write the prequel with so much time from the original.  
user1: It then captures a whole different audience and loses it's original youngsters that initially loved the first movie and then had outgrown seeing this one. 
user1: I think movies need to be closer together so they can retain some of the same audience along with gain new followers. 
user2: i agree 
user1: Do you ever watch movies based on their scores or ratings?
user2: yes I don't watch them in theaters so if I going to pay to watch them I want to know there good 
user2: not sure what to do now.....
user2: hello
user2: hello

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hey! Would you like me to tell you about Monsters University?
user1: Sure!
user2: Okay great. It is the prequel to Monsters Inc. It tells the story of Mike and Sully studying at college, where they start off as rivals but slowly become best friends.
user1: Cool, is it any good?
user2: It's great! Are you a pixar or disney fan?
user1: I am
user1: I love Monsters Inc.
user1: Do you think the prequel lives up to it?
user2: Oh cool! You'd definitely enjoy this movie then.
user2: I think it's a good movie, but definitely not as good as the original. I don't think it can be topped, however it is a cute insight into how they met and their background. 
user1: Yeah, that makes sense
user1: Are there any good new characters introduced?
user2: Yes, their friends in college, and the dean at the college who is the chair of the scare program, she is great.
user2: They also meet Scott Squibbles, who is Mike's fraternity member. 
user1: Do you know who does the voice for the dean?
user2: Yes, it's Helen Mirren. 
user1: Oh, nice
user1: What else can you tell me?
user2: It shows Mike as a seven year old, and he's so cute lol
user2: Mike starts out in the scare program and studies hard, but lacks the element of scare, while Sully comes from a line of talented scarers, and struggles with his studies, but gets by on his familys reputation. 
user1: Nice
user1: I want to see seven year old Mike
user2: Yeah, it's a cute kids movie. My daughter loves it.
user2: He looks so adorable haha, he wears a monsters university hat on a field trip to the college and his eye takes up his whole body.
user1: Do you like Pixar movies?
user2: Yes, I love them. Some of my favorite movies are pixar. And you?
user1: yes, same
user2: So do you have any desire to check this movie out?
user1: Definitely
user1: I wasn't sure if I would want to or not.
user1: Thanks.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: I don't have the movie info, so you'll have to tell me which movie it is.
user2: Do you like animated movies? If you do, you should watch Monsters University. It's the prequel to Pixar's Monsters, Inc.
user1: I do like some animated films.  Who does the voices for this one?
user2: Some of the voice actors consist of John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Billy Crystal and Bob Peterson. 
user1: I like a few of them.  Especially John Goodman.  Does it say if the movie has songs?  I don't like musical cartoons very much.
user2: There is music that is compose by Randy Newman, who has collaborated with Pixar 7 times. 
user1: Not a fan of his music.  What can you tell me about the story?
user2: Well it's about two monsters, Sulley and Mike, and their time in college. It tells the story of their journey from being rivals to really good friends. 
user1: it's a prequel to the original?  (i haven't seen either one)
user2: Yes, is is the prequel to the Monsters, Inc movie from 2001.
user1: how are the reviews?
user2: They are fairly good. It has an A with CinemaScore and a 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: yeah that's really good.
user1: any more info?
user2: It is. The critics say good things about it too. They say that it really holds true to the spirit of the 2001 movie. 
user1: what do the monsters learn about in college?
user2: How to be good scarers - which are monsters that collect childrens screams for energy by entering into the human world at night to scare them. It's not scary at all, I promise. 
user1: energy from screams.  that's interesting.  too bad for the kids, though.
user1: i suppose i should watch the first one before this one
user2: Yeah, it can seem pretty scary. Its a fun movie though. I would reccomnd watching the first one too if you wanted to get the full effect. 
user1: makes sense
user1: any more plot details?
user2: Well remember how I said the main character Sully and Mike were rivals? Well they end up joining this fraternity called Oozma Kappa and compete with other fraternities in different challanges. 
user1: what kind of challenges?
user2: Well for example one challange is a bedroom scare simulator. 
user1: sounds funny
user1: what are some other characters?
user2: Yeah it's a really fun movie. Oozma Kappa is known for being the weekest fraternity on campus, so it's a little bit of an underdog tale. 
user1: i see
user2: Other characters like Randall Boggs and Roz make an apperance. 
user1: are those other monsters?
user2: Yes, they are. 
user1: we're done!  nice chatting with you
user2: Awesome! Thanks

conversation:

user2: I dont have movie by my side, i have a blank screen
user2: talk to me about monsters university
user2: what kind of movie is it?
user2: who s the main character?
user1: It is about monsters. The two main characters Mike and Sulley are back in school trying to learn the ways of scaring kids.
user2: Oh great... Can I watch it witth my 4 yeors old son?
user1: I'm not sure because it doesn't have a rating, but it does seem like a  kid's story
user2: oooh Okay
user1: The plot seems pretty interesting and should teach some life lessons to your kid, so it is a plus.
user2: Ooo okay.... When was it released?
user1: It was was released in 2013
user2: and now I just wnat to know who realised this movie
user1: It is a comedy, animation and has a 79% rotten tomatoes rating, and 65/100 for meteoritic and A for CinemaScore
user1: The director is Dan Scanlon
user2: Ohhh great 
user2: great
user1: So you're going to watch it with your kid?
user2: I am not sure, but I ll wait a while befeore doing this
user2: may be in 1 year
user2: when did you watch it ?
user2: just after its release?
user1: I watched it recently, you should watch it now because it is the prequel to their other movies
user2: oh yeah?
user2: I ll do so
user1: Some critical responses are "is true to the spirit of [Monsters, Inc.] and matches its tone. But it never seems content toturn over old ground."
user1: "It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz ofits fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result."
user1: "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful."
user2: great
user2: great
user1: Great have fun!
user2: so thank you for all these infrmation

conversation:
user2: Have you seen Monsters University
user1: yes
user1: good animated flick
user2: What did you think about John Goodman as Sully?
user1: I think his vvoice fit well
user2: Yes, and Dean Abigail was cool
user2: Yes,
user1: Steve Buscemi as Randy was great
user2: It was a true spirit movie 
user1: surprised the rotten tomato score was that low
user2: Billy Crystal topped if off 
user1: yes indeed
user2: Yes, Rotten tomatoes was tough on it.  
user1: Mike striving to become a scary monster was fun to follow
user2: What did you think of it as a sequal
user1: Pretty good.  This one was best
user2: The return of characters made it memorable and fun 
user1: oh yes i ndeed
user2: The metacritic score was hard on it too.
user1: the scare games contest was captivating
user2: I did like the Cinema score was A though
user2: It definitely was a good comedy.
user1: yes that was an appropriate score
user1: When Mike and Sulley got expelled I thought that was it
user2: Mike was aspiring to be a scarer and always most cool as a monster
user2: I feel for the monsters and having to prove themselves.
user2: Did you like the Oozma Kappa
user1: And they had to work their way to become part of the scarer team
user1: good lessons for kids
user1: yes i did
user2: They were the weakest fraternity for the kids but misfits Mike is in 
user1: yes it was
user2: They did do a good lesson for kids and Sully tampering to let Mike win was a lesson in itself
user1: they did well in the games
user2: They joining Monsters inc was explained which was interesting
user2: bye
user2: Hope you enjoy the movie if you see it again.
user2: great talking

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey! Want to talk about the movie Monsters University?
user2: Ok
user1: It's a really cute and funny movie starring Billy Crstal and John Goodman!
user2: I like the name of the movie. Can you tell me more about it, please?
user2: I have never heard about these names.
user2: But I would be willing to give it a try.
user1: It's about Mike and Sully, two monsters going to college who start off as rivals and become best friends!
user2: I like how it sounds.
user2: Interesting plot.
user2: What else can you tell me about it?
user1: It's also animate by Pixar - do you like them? I think their movies are awesome!
user2: Yes. I am a big fan. They are always have quality projects coming out.
user2: You never miss with them.
user2: It is always a hit.
user1: I agree, and this film is the same. It's a prequel to Monsters Inc, which is a classic! This tells the story of how the two main characters met
user2: I am fallowing.
user1: Mike has always wanted to be a "scarer" and studies and works really hard to be the best!
user1: Sully comes from a lineage of pro scarers so he doesn't really study and is instantly popular
user2: OK. That sounds interesting.
user2: What about the ratings for this movie?
user1: It has an A from CinemaScore!
user2: Are they truthful to its content?
user1: I would say so!
user1: want to hear about my favorite part?
user2: Yes, sure.
user1: So the two monsters get kicked out of college and have to find a way to get back in. They are allowed to be reinstated and join the weakest fraternity. 
user1: Because Mike has studied SO hard, he's the most booksmart scarer.
user2: Continue, please.
user1: They end up winning the "scare Games" because Mike knows everything in the book about scaring
user1: In the end, they rely on his intelligence rather than just his reputation!
user2: Intelligence always prevails.
user2: It sounds like a good story to watch.
user2: I am pretty sure my kids would love it.
user1: I think so! I like that it tells the story leading up to them taking jobs at Monsters Inc.
user1: It's definitely cute and imaginative!
user2: That is a well deserved ending.
user2: Yes, agree.
user1: It was great chatting with you! I hope you'll watch it!
user2: Thank you for chatting. Have a nice day.

conversation:
user2: Hey Hey!!! So have you heard of this amazing movie called Monsters University?
user1: No I haven't actually? What kind of movie is it?
user2: AHHH you are going to love it. Monsters University is a animated comedy about two best friends who are monsters who decide to take on college.
user1: Ahh, I see. An animated movie. I do enjoy em' every now and again. anyone I would know who does voice acting in that movie?
user2: Oh I am sure you have heard of Billy Crystal and John Goodman, they are both legends!!! I think my favorite though is Steve Buscemi, because he is just too funny.
user1: Wow sounds like a great cast! I love John Goodman and Steve Buscemi is amazing. Could you tell me more about the storyline? What do Monsters actually "do" in college anyway? haha
user2: It is the store about Mike and Sulley who start out as rivals and quickly become best friends. They go to scare classes because after all the are monsters. But one of the best parts of the movies is where they form their own fraternity.
user1: That sounds hilarious! Since there in college, is there any suggestive content? What is this movie rated exactly? 
user2: It is a children's movie, so it is only rated G and there is not explicated content. Some funny scenes where parents will understand more than the child.
user1: Good to know. As a matter of fact, I think I remember the original one back in 2001, and it was really good. This must be a prequel film, am I correct? Since it takes place in the college years as opposed to them working regular jobs. BI'm really getting interested
user2: The original was a classic. Yes you are right, this would be the prequel to the first one where you really get to know the characters. I loved watching this one, and then going back and watching the first and seeing how they transitioned from college to the work field.
user2: What is the typical genre of movies you watch?
user1: Yeah I have to say I'm pretty sold on it. 
user1: and I usually watch comedy movies, across all types, including animation, but I am also a big fan of action movies. 
user1: Does this fall in line with what you typically watch as well?
user2: I love animations and comedy, so it is definitely up my alley. 
user1: and this is from Pixar studios, correct?
user1: Because I always get Dreamworks Studios and Pixar confused with which is which haha
user1: Either way though, I think this sounds like a good flick. I'm especially sold on the frat scene you mentioned. 
user1: I do think I'd like to see it

conversation:
user1: Hi have you seen Monsters Inc?
user2: Monsters Inc, I have heard of it but havent seen it before
user2: whats the storyline behind it?
user2: you there?
user1: Oh well then you should start with Monsters University! Its the prequel to Monsters Inc
user1: Its a kids movie, but very well done with a great story
user2: Is it an animated movie?
user2: Oh ok great suggestion! I like to start from the beginning of things so I know whats going on 
user1: The two main characters (monsters) Sulley and Mike go to college for scaring. Yep its animated, and very cute
user1: Rotten tomatoes was 79%, but I enjoy kids movies so I think thats why I love it so much lol
user2: lol thats cute for scaring! It sounds like a fun movie, I like animation
user2: Do you happen to know who performs the voice overs?
user2: I think the last animation movie I watched was Toy Story! #classic
user1: Mike and Sulley both end up at Monsters University, and they do not get along at first. Mike works really hard and Sulley was a privileged monster growing up. 
user1: It has Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the two main characters. 
user2: Thats awesome to know!
user1: I could watch Toy Story over and over lol... I think you'd really enjoy this then!
user1: I usually enjoy anything produced by Pixar
user2: I'm excited! lol 
user2: Yes Pixar doesnt a great job creating 
user2: So its there a part 1 and part 2 correct?
user1: well Monsters Inc was done first, and then they relased the prequel so its a little confusing lol. But the story is still easy to follow
user1: Monsters University has a lot to do with their joining a fraternity Oozma Kappa, in order to stay in school. Mike & Sulley got kicked out because of their arguing in front of the headmaster
user2: Oh ok I understand! 
user2: Lol thats really life like in a kid like form movie
user1: They take part in scare games, which are pretty funny to watch.
user1: you just cant help but fall in love with the characters too!
user2: What do the characters look like? 
user2: I cant wait to watch it now 
user1: Sulley is BIG, hairy and blue lol. Mike is a small little green ball with one eye. I bet if you saw them you would have seen them from somewhere
user1: and in the end, they both end up getting jobs at Monsters Inc. in the mailroom. And become best friends lol
user2: hahaha! Yeah your probably right 
user1: And that is where the Movie Monsters Inc was born ;-)
user1: Both my kids and I love it. It is good at "haunting the imagination" as one critic put it.. very true!
user2: Ok wow! sounds like something I'd like to watch. Ive been slacking lately with the animations
user2: If the kids love it then its gold! 
user1: I hope you find and watch both, enjoy!
user2: My niece usually makes sure I am updated on the kid movies. Im sure she's seen it 
user2: I definitely will! 
user2: Is it on Netflix you think?
user1: Hmmm I havent seen it, and we watch a lot of kids stuff on netflix lol.. I bet you could rent it though! 

conversation:
user2: Hey!
user1: Hello
user1: I cant believe this movie didnt get a better review
user2: What movie?
user1: MOnsters University
user2: Awesome!  what was your favorite part?
user1: I loved when they just got to college.
user1: It was hillarious
user1: How about you?
user2: That was mine as well

conversation:
user2: Hi have you seen the movie Monsters University?
user1: I have not 
user1: have you ? was it good ?
user2: It was made in 2013 and it is a Comedy Animation.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it 6.8/10 79%
user2: It tells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley and their time studying at college, where they start off as rivals, but slowly become best friends.  
user2: I have seen it and would recommend that you watch it if you are in to comedy
user2: Hello is anyone there?

conversation:
user2: hello
user2: what did you think of the movie
user1: I feel that this movie is cute and entertaining for both children and adults. What did you think of the movie?
user2: i agree very entertaining 
user2: although it is a cartoon in a way it is relatable 
user1: I agree with you. I think that it shows that we can find unlikely friendships in those that we may not like at first and can find similarities in those that we feel we are different from. 
user2: yes so true 
user2: usually we meet people at first and not really get along but along the way, we end up being friends with them
user1: Absolutely. I think this is a great way to teach children these lessons without them realizing it and it's a great way to remind adults of these lessons as well.
user2: As adult we also learn that things dont always go as planned
user2: we go to universities hoping and planning to study something and usually end up changing our major multiple times 
user1: That's absolutely true. I did so myself several times. I think it was a great idea to have this movie to be based in college for that very reason.
user2: its like even monster don't have their life together 
user1: Lol that's a great way to put it. If monsters don't, why should we? Lol 
user2: also i think collage/universities are suppose to teach us more on life than school anyways
user2: sometime its nice to have a friend who is better at things than we are.
user1: I think so, too. This is the first time that most people have to decide things for themselves in terms of their futures and what they want to do with their lives.
user2: yeah and collage opens up our eye to so many different opportunities
user2: our dreams and goals might have been influenced by our environment thus when we change our environment, we grow as individuals and find our new ways which can cause us to change where we are headed 
user1: I can agree with that just from personal experiences. 
user1: The ratings on this movie were not very consistent. Which do you agree with?
user2: In monster university we have two frenemies one is good at scaring and the other is good with books, if they could have helped each other they both would have been able to succeed instead of failing  
user2: i think it should have gotten a better rating 
user1: That is very true as well. They could have learned from one another and applied those lessons to their own lives. 
user1: I agree as well. I think the 65/100 and 6.8/10 were very harsh.
user2: yeah specially since its better than most movies
user2: would you watch a sequal 
user2: sequel* 
user1: I definitely would watch a sequel depending on what it is about. 
user2: maybe them trying to find a job 
user1: It would be nice to see them as adults with their own families and how life is treating them.
user2: because God knows its hard to find a job. i want to see the take on that
user2: yeah and a weeding will be nice too
user1: A wedding would be so cute! That's a great idea!
user2: i dont know i appreciate watching movies that actually have real life fee to them, even if they are animated
user1: I do as well. It makes them more believable and tolerable to watch. 
user2: feel*
user2: i totally agree
user2: have you even watched any other movie by the same director
user1: I cannot recall that I have. Have you?
user2: i think he also directed cars
user2: the animated movies 
user2: i watched that one
user1: I have not seen that movie. Did you like it?
user2: to be honest dont remember much 
user1: I suppose it did not leave much of an impression on you since you don't remember much.
user2: i guess not 
user2: what kind of movies do you like to watch
user1: I like to watch all types of movies but my favorites are animation, thriller, and romance. 
user1: What kinds do you like to watch?
user2: i prefer tv shows but i like hallmark movies
user2: the movies remind me of all the dance and cheerleading movies  
user1: What is your favorite Hallmark movie? What would you suggest?
user2: with the way they enter the fraternity  scare game and they become last first and then they end up winning 
user2: summer villa
user2: naughty or nice 

conversation:
user1: HELLO
user2: Hello!
user1: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MOIVIE
user1: THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE MY KIDS LOVED IT 
user2: No, what movie are you talking about?
user1: MONSTERS UNIVERISITY
user1: BILLY CRYSTAL PLAYED LEAD 
user2: Oh I see, I don't recall watching it
user1: very funny really had you entertained the whole time watching
user2: So it is a comedy movie, what is the main plot?
user1: yes-  comedy- the main plot was kind of all over the place but its been awhile since ive seen it and i cant really remember
user1: im suprised it wsnt rated very well
user2: Well, I looked it up it was produced by Pixar, and it was a prequel to Monsters Inc
user2: For the next movies is always hard to get a good appreciation from the critics
user2: I think it is quite cute how the movie portrayed how people dream about their future, in the case of Mike Wazowski
user2: Going to the company and then years later finally getting into the university to fulfill his dream.

conversation:
user1: hello!
user2: hello
user1: have you seen this movie
user2: no i haven't seen it
user1: I have a long time ago
user1: It is an animated film. With Mike and Sulley
user1: Did you see the first one?
user2: no  i dont think so 
user2: sounds like it would be a good movie
user1: Oh, well it is pretty similar to that one
user1: Yes, it is really cute
user1: The colors are really vibrant and held my 4 year olds attention 
user1: This one is about the characters at college. 
user2: yes, i was just thinking my kids would enjoy this movie 
user2: and i love comedies
user2:  john goodman is a good actor
user1: It is funny!
user1: OMG, yes he is!!!
user2: not to bad of a rating either 
user1: When the movie first starts out Mike and Sulley don't really like each other and are always trying to one up one another
user1: But by the end they overcame their differences and became the best of friends.
user2: ah ok, well im gonna have to watch that
user1: It has a great lesson for kids in it
user2: awesome
user2: do you watch a lot of movies
user1: Not really my kids control what we watch. So it is a lot of films like this
user2: oh ok
user1: This movie has a few scary parts, but my kids still liked it
user1: Do you watch a lot of movies?
user2: couple times a month we all sit down and watch a movie but its usually something scary or really funny
user1: That's cool!
user2: my kids do watch a lot of anime movies, they have probably seen this movie
user1: l like that this shows how the got their jobs .
user1: In the first one they are in the mail room, but it never really told you how they met each other. 
user2: sounds like it would be a really good movie 
user2: interesting 
user1: it is, you should check it out
user2: yes i will

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hello there! How are you today?
user1: I'm good thanks.  Do you ever watch good computer animated kids movies?
user2: I do, Pixar and DreamWorks movies are my favorite. How about you do you like animated movies?
user1: I like them quite a bit.  One of my favorite ones is Mosters University.
user1: It is a Pixar movie that came out in 2013.
user2: Monsters University is a good one! Is that the latest one you've seen?
user2: I hear it is a lot different than Monsters, what is it about?
user1: It's a prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc.
user1: It's about how Sulley and Mike met each other in college while studying.
user2: Oh, awesome. I need to check that out. I really like both of those characters.
user2: Sulley is the blue one, right?
user1: Yes, Sulley comes from a pedigreed scarer background but is lazy at his studies.
user1: They try to join a fraternity, but only Sulley gets accepted.
user2: Well, Mike is a little awkward. with the one eye and all.
user1: Mike studied very hard.  He is the little one.
user2: Do you know if his parents have one eye as well?
user2: What does Mike do when he doesn't get into the frat?
user1: Mike joins a weaker fraternity, and Sulley joins them to help them try to win the Scare Games.  
user2: Do the train for the games?
user1: Because Sulley was kicked out of the Scare Program for not studying enough.
user2: Oh no, he got kicked out?!
user1: I think they just use their knowledge and compete to win, and of course their ability.
user2: That's terrible
user1: Yes he must have failed some midterms or something.
user2: Yeah, probably too busy playing beer pong or whatever it is monsters do in their spare time
user1: At the end, they did a scare and broke the scream box they were so good.  It got them expelled though.
user2: How could they break the scream box?
user2: Probably with some crazy antics, right?
user1: The scare level was so high, you'll have to see it!  The Dean Hardscrabble congratulated them on being that scary, but they were still expelled.
user1: Then they went to work at Monsters, Inc. in the mail room and worked their way up into the scarer team.

conversation:
user1: I love the fact that Billy Crystal played Mike Wazowski and John Goodman played Sulley.  What a great pair!
user2: Yes, they were great casting options.
user2: Do you like Pixar movies?
user1: I do.  I liked them even before I had kids.  
user2: Do you think the Rotten Tomatoes rating is accurate for the movie?
user1: I guess.  Truthfully, I don't let the Rotten Tomatoes rating ever influence my decision in watching movies.  
user2: Yeah, I guess sometimes you just need to judge a movie for yourself.
user2: Did you think a prequel was appropriate or should they have made a sequel instead?
user1: Indeed.  It's hard to believe that Monsters University was Pixar's fourteenth feature film.  
user1: I loved the fact that it was a prequel. It was something a little different.  It 
user1: is always cool to get a bit of a backstory.
user2: Yes, it was interesting to see how Mike and Sulley got together.
user1: Yeah.  There was also a cute factor about seeing the characters as little monsters.
user2: I liked how they showed that Mike originally wanted to become a scarer.
user1: Yeah, I like that too.  
user2: It's also creative that in the monster world they use scream for energy.
user1: The creativity that comes with Monsters University is top notch.
user2: The two characters contrasted well with Mike as the studious one and Sulley relying on natural abilty.
user1: The "Scare Games" were so funny.  
user2: Yeah, that part of the movie was good. Nice creative tasks.
user1: The fraternity "Oozma Kappa" was just an awesome group of misfits.  I enjoyed seeing them work together, even if they were considered the weakest fraternity on campus.
user2: Mike used his knowledge and motivational speaking to make them stronger.
user2: Yeah, they were a rag tag group with hidden potential.
user1: I agree.  I felt so bad for Mike when he figured out Sulley put the final scare machine on the easiest setting.  How terrible for him.
user2: Sulley should have just let Mike compete on a level playing field against the others.
user1: I was super surprised that the movie ended the way it did.  I was surprised that they were not reinstated to the University.
user2: Yeah, I was expecting them to also be reinstated.
user1: I like it though.  It's a good lesson for kids to learn.  The rules are the rules.
user1: It was heartwarming when Hardscrabble wishes them luck.
user1: The movie had a positive message all around
user2: It was interesting to see them still find a pathway to working at Monster's Inc. via the mailroom.
user1: Yes.
user2: I also liked how Hardscrabble was eventually impressed by Mike.
user1: Yes, I liked that she learned a lesson as well.
user2: Sulley also showed Hardscrabble that he can learn more than just his natural ability.
user1: I also liked how the rest of the fraternity was able to go on in the scare program.  It made me happy for them.
user2: Hardscrabble learned to not underestimate someone at first glance.
user1: Yes, an important lesson to be learned.
user2: Yeah, I liked that too. They improved their abilities with good coaching.
user1: I agree with the addition of some confidence.
user2: I wonder if Pixar is done with this franchise or if they will try to make another.
user1: I was just thinking the same thing!  Another sequel would be great.  Pixar has proven time and time again that they can  make multiple great movies off of a franchise.  I am looking forward to it.
user2: In the end it's a funny movie with great characters learning life lessons and also great visuals.
user2: Bye, nice chatting.
user1: I agree.  Great movie for everyone. Nice chatting with you too.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hello!
user2: Looks like we got the movie Monster's University. 
user2: Have you seen it?
user2: My Favorite Character has to be Mike Wazowski, However the guy who voices him annoys me. 
user2: Are you there?

conversation:
user2: Monsters University 2013, Comedy by Animation
user2: Did you see the movie?
user1: yes a long time ago
user1: im surprised that it got a 79%
user2: I suppose you're right it did come out in 2013
user2: You didn't like it?
user1: yes it was a good movie
user1: how about you did you like it
user2: oh okay, yeah I liked it, Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great
user1: the responses seem very dramatic for a comedy
user2: CinemaScore was an A but the Metacritic was 65/100, pretty diverse ratings
user2: I was thinking the same thing, a childrens comedy none the less
user2: The Roar Omega Roar, great frat
user1: yes! the summery is similar to a lot of other movies i noticing
user2: yeah but Billy Crystal fit the role of Mike very well.
user1: not sure of anything else that he was in?
user2: I really couldn't imagine him as a scarer
user2: a lot of movies, something to look up later. 
user1: for sure
user2: I forgot that Sulley tampered with the machine to let Mike win the sim room
user2: such a sad moment
user1: the key notes are talking about the scene when they join the scare games to get restated but i forgot that they even got kicked out of school
user2: yeah it was end of the scare games that Sulley tampered with the machine to let Mike win
user2: he moved the simulation room to the easiest setting
user1: but it goes to show some people can and some teach
user2: aint that the truth
user2: Oozma Kappa, man these writers weren't very creative lol
user2: I kind of see the critics point of views now with some of the details, but it was a kids movie for the most part
user1: thats true in a lot of things though 
user2: you're right,
user2: True up and comer, good guys win in the end, they get hired into the mail room
user2: and then well the rest is history, they make it to the scare floor which brings us back to the first movie (best one of the series)
user1: yes the original is always better
user2: This isn't really a movie I'll go rush out to see again to be honest, it had its moments and the characters are good but the writing was sub par
user1: true i think this is the movie you wait till its on dvd or blu ray to see it 
user2: if its on TV when i am flipping through channels on a lazy day I'd give it a watch though.
user1: there isnt a real reason to go to the theater 
user1: unless with a child
user2: and I don't think it will be in the theatres again unless its at one of the bargain places
user2: Some funny scenes but overall a "meh" rating from me but no harsh criticisms like others
user1: yes the sequel was not needed in my opinion 
user2: this was the the third in the series I beleive, but anyway it was nice talking with you

conversation:
user1: It describes the beginning of Mike and Sully but not as good as the orginal 
user2: But Billy Crystal is hilarious as Mike Wazowski
user1: Do you agree withthe rating of this movie 
user2: I agree with CinemaScore giving it an A
user2: What did you think of Abominable?  LOL
user1: who ? where they in this movie or is it a rip off of this movie. Been a while since I have seen it 
user1: Oh I see now snowman. sorry I do not remeber them in the movie 
user2: Abominable Snowman.  John Ratzenberger did the voice.
user2: Do you usually like animated movies?
user1: He does at least one voice for each of the Pixar movies.  He has made a good living after Cheers 
user1: I used to watch them all the time when my kids were small, I do like them tho 
user2: Little Mike Wazowski was so friggin' cute!
user1: yes he was and is....Sully look s so soft .   This movie is like Animal House for Kids 
user2: LOL  What did you think of college-age Sully?
user1: Loved him too.    Do you like all Pixar Movies 
user2: Most of them, yes, but especially if they're emotional.  Dean Hardscabble scared my kids in that scene when Sully breaks the scream can.
user2: I don't remember the Scare Games much.  Guess I need to watch again!
user2: What was your favorite Scare Games event?
user1: Had been a while since I have seen this and I saw it at a drive in.  I saw Monsters Inc at least 100 times on video when my daughter as young. It is her fav Pixar Movie 
user1: Avoid the Parent
user2: LOL  I <3 Oozma Kappa!
user1: Did this movie ever make you sad 
user2: Yes!  When Sully busts the scare machine so they'll win!  Poor Mike.
user2: Do you think any of the Oozma Kappas made good scarers?
user1: They are too cute to be scary and they have big hearts. I do not think any of them want to scare the kids  in reality 
user2: I'm not sure.  What did you think of Hardscabble admitting she was surprised?
user2: Do you think they deserved to be expelled?
user1: No 
user2: What do you think of Hardscabble?
user1: I like Hardscrabble she made me laugh 
user2: How long do you think it took Mike and Sully to make it from the mailroom to the Scare Team?
user1: a semsester ? maybe 

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: hi!
user2: Have you ever heard of any of these voice actors? I have watched the film but I am just terrible with names
user1: Of course. I loved John Goodman as as Mike.
user1: I think he's most famous for playing Dan on Roseanne.
user1: Are the voice actors your favorite part of an animated movie?
user2: Oh cool! Did you like the movie? 
user2: nah, i prefer the animation style
user1: Oh. I loved it. I loved the originals Monsters Inc. and it was nice to see how the friendship between Mike and Sully started.
user2: Right? The plot line was so nice. I really liked how they chose to make a prequel! 
user1: If your favorite part is the animation, then you must have been a little disappointed. Critics were a little harsh on the animation. What's your favorite animation style, anyways?
user2: Honestly, I dont know! I really don't like claymation though. I also like the stick figure style animations
user2: Sully really had a lot of character development! Do you like where they went with it? 
user1: Yes. At first he was just this immature frat boy and as the movie progresses we see a lot of growth.
user2: Me too! He became such a good person. Honestly I didn't like him at first, he was so rude and arrogant
user1: I specially liked in the end he was a true friend to Mike.
user2: Yeah! It was such a heartwarming scene. Pixar can really pull those heart strings
user1: It was the first time that Pixar did a prequel on one of its films. I wonder if they'd do more. Are you a fan of prequels in general?
user2: Yeah! Most. SOmetimes they dont do well (like star wars) but they do give some interesting backsotory. It's like expanding the universe
user2: Do you think this was better than the original? Or just an okay film
user1: I think it was better than the first in terms of character development. 
user1: For example, one of my favorite parts of the movie is Mike's perseverance in the face of obstacles. Like when he entered the scare games after being kicked out of the scare program.
user2: Yeah! He really showed his commitance to his dreams! It's so strange that the critics gave this film some poor ratings!
user1: I agree!
user1: Like the metacritic store was just 65
user1: The rotten tomatoes was just a 6.8 out of 10
user2: I know! At least Cinimascore gave them an A, they deserved it
user1: :(
user1: Yeah :)
user2: This was also a good underdog story! Do you like those
user1: Yeah. Who doesn't?
user2: True! THey're the best.
user1: Which character was your favorite?
user2: thats a hard question! I really like the Randall in this one. He is just such a hard shift from the last movie, you know?
user2: what about you?
user1: I liked Mike and Scully, but my favorite was Dean Hardscrabble.
user1: I really liked the way she could instill fear and respect in the students by her mere presence.
user2: The dragon, right? 
user1: Yep.
user2: Yeah! Great character, really creepy and just cool in general
user1: Great talk. Bye!
user2: bye!! <3

conversation:
user2: are you there
user1: Yes I am here.
user1: So, Monster's University is the movie we're talking about right now. Made by Pixar. You've heard of it, right? Has John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi in it as character voices. 

conversation:
user1: Hey hows it going?
user2: Hi how are you?
user1: Real good just finished watching a movie.
user2: What movie?
user1: Monsters University, ever see it?
user2: Actually, yes its an adorable movie. did you like oit?
user1: I do I loved it, especially Billy Crystals acting, he was so good.
user2: I didnt realize Billy Crystal was in this movie.
user2: I did know John Goodman played in it
user1: Oh yeah him and Steve Buscemi for sure, and Goodman is great too.
user1: My favorite seen was when mike was trying to be super scary.
user2: John Goodman is such a good actor
user1: Didn't score very good in the reviews for some reason, 65/100 on metacritic
user2: Yea I loved it when he was trying to be scary too. My kids love it too
user1: I liked when sulley got accepeted to the fraternity on campus.
user2: I think its cute Mikey and him sulley were trying to fix the door
user1: Oh absolutely, it was so cute. Mike works so hard at it.
user2: Yes, and Sulley had the last piece of it lol
user1: Exactlyyyy,turns out mike is kind of sneaky.
user2: yes
user1: Any other good scenes you liked?
user2: That is probably my favorite scene, but i like all of the movie. What about you?
user1: I think my favorite is when they're getting expelled from the university but then get offered jobs in the mail room to join the scare team
user2: Yes, thats good too. I liked when they joined the misfits too
user1: Oh absolutely, how would you rate the movie yourself?
user2: I would say its 7.5/10. what do you think?
user1: I'd go with about an 8/10, would for sure like to check it out again sometime.
user2: Oh yea, we watch it whenever its on
user2: do your kids like it?
user2: looks like we can finish the conversation now

conversation:
user2: Monsters University.
user1: Hi ! how are you?
user2: 2013 Comedy Animation.
user2: I am great and you?
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: Im good. Monsters University was cool, I like 3D animations.
user2: Me too. Pixar is great.
user1: Pixar makes some really neat movies. do you know about monsters university?
user2: Yes, love the movie. I love Billy Crystal as Mike.
user1: It's their 14th movie already!
user2: And John GOodman's Sulley
user1: I love Steve Buscemi
user2: Rotten Tomatoes rated 79
user2: %
user1: the metacritic % was lower and i think thats sad.
user1: What did you think of the score? Im a big music fan
user2: I liked it a lot. 
user1: I also think its neat that it was a prequel to monsters inc, i loved that movie
user2: Yes, both are great movies.
user2: The oozma Kappa was hilarious. 
user1: Which movie do you think was better?
user1: Some of the reviews thought it was a bit disappointing i guess
user2: Monsters University.
user1: One of thr critics sais its true to the spirit, but its just turning over old ground :/
user2: Safe, predictable, edge-free....yeah, that critic one got bored.
user1: also that it wasnt inspired
user1: Its wild that people come up with these ideas, i dont think its boring at all. like oozma kappa!
user2: The two take jobs in the mail room, then work their way up to join the scare team. I like how this movie ties the first in so well.
user1: simulation bedroom... hahaha
user1: A true underdog story,
user2: Hardscrabble was mean. Bu she turned around in the end. They were the first to surprise her.
user1: Now I feel like watching it. its been awhile
user2: Lol. I think my kids have it. 
user2: I need to get it out.

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: Hi!
user2: Did you like the movie?
user1: Monsters University seems like it would be a funny movie
user2: Yes, I always enjoy a good Pixar. Interesting that it's a prequel.
user2: Do you think it was a good idea? Or, do you think a movie like Monsters, Inc should stand alone?
user1: I think movies that do as well as Monsters, Inc should be built upon
user1: No reasons not to make things more interesting and add to the plot.
user2: It received pretty good ratings and of course the actors have good reputations as well. I like it when sequels can get the originals actors to come back
user1: I totally agree.
user1: It does not work for me when sequels do not involve the same actors.
user1: The critics seemed to like the movie a lot, which is hard nowadays.
user2: Agreed! I get the sense that most critics enjoyed it and those who didn't only found it to be "okay". No one seems to think it was bad. Maybe safe, but not bad.
user1: I agree. What do you think about the dean failing both Mike and Sulley at the end of the semester?
user2: I think it probably ended up helping both characters to grow up and stop fighting. It was perhaps the catalyst for their longterm friendship. Maybe for kids it demonstrates that regardless of your background you need to get along and work hard at your school/job. What do you think?
user1: That makes sense to me. Hardship and mistakes are necessary to grow as individuals and as friends. I think this was a wake up call they both needed.
user2: Did you get the impression in Monster's, Inc that Sulley came from a privileged background and Mike did not? I thought that was an interesting way to navigate their past.
user1: Sulley definitely seemed to have an advantage coming from a family of such great scarers. 
user2: How do you think it made Mike feel to see Sulley be so easily successful?
user1: I feel like it could go either way. It could have served as motivation or it could have made him feel inferior.
user2: Yes, it seems like it made him feel inferior at first. Then, when they had to win the "Sacre Games", I think that chip on his shoulder motivated him to share his intricate knowledge with the others. What do you think of the scene where Sulley tampers with the machine's difficulty level?
user1: That's a tricky one. What Sulley did was wrong. However, he was trying to help a friend.
user1: And help his team win.
user2: Yes, I think he did it with good intentions. But, I don't think Mike will see it that way. It's like it gave him false hope about his skills.
user1: Mike should feel confident that he carried the team throughout the tournament though.
user2: Agreed, he should. Yet, on the other hand - the only reason they won was because Sulley change the setting to the easiest. 
user1: That is true. But there is a good message in that failure did not mean the end of the road for them. They worked in the mail room and worked their way up to the level of scarer.
user2: That's a good point. I don't really think they should have been expelled, but it did force both of them to work even harder to become the best in their field. 
user2: What do you think of the fast that Hardscrabble says they were the first to surprise her?
user1: I disagree about your statement regarding expulsion. I think she was correct in expelling them. Any sign that the administration condones that would not not go over well for the university.
user1: I think it was good that they had an original idea.
user2: Okay, I see what you mean. I would expect an actual university to deal severely with cheating.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi, the movie is Monsters University.
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: Oh wow - no I haven't seen it yet.
user2: It is an animation comedy. 
user1: I was thinking about watching it though.
user1: That sounds good.
user1: Was it funny?
user2: Billy Crystal plays the voice of one of the main characters Micheal "Mike" Wazowski. 
user1: He's a funny guy!
user2: In the comedy genre, I would say yes it is funny! 
user1: Great!
user2: Mike wants to become a scarier monster. 
user1: Let me guess - he goes to Monster University to learn how?
user2: The monsters go into the human world at night and scare children and harvest their screams. 
user2: Yes, he is a first year student there! 
user1: Does he get to go on field trips at night to scare kids?
user2: Not really field trips, but that is what they do is scare kids. 
user1: Why do they harvest the screams?
user2: I am not really sure why they do that. 
user1: Okay.  Are there any more famous names I might recognize in the movie?
user2: Yes, John Goodman plays Sully and Helen Mirren plays Dean Abigail Hardscrabble
user1: Oh super I love both of them!
user2: she is the chair of the Scarer Program 
user1: LOL
user1: John Goodman is a riot!  I love his stuff.
user2: I agree! he plays a good character in this movie, it was an excellent role for him. 
user1: He steals the show every time.
user2: The movie has fairly good reviews too! CinemaScore is an A 
user1: Would you recommend the movie?
user2: I would for sure! It is one of  my favorites! 
user2: It came out in 2013
user1: Okay cool.
user2: You should watch it some time! 
user1: I don't know why I missed it, I will!
user1: Nice chatting with you!
user2: You too! 

conversation:
user1: Have you seen Monsters University?
user2: No but I have seen the first monsters movie.
user1: I'd highly recommend it
user2: It does look good.
user1: It's hard for me to pick which one I liked better
user1: It was good that they brought back the same actors from the first one
user2: yeah though I would have prefered they make a sequel instead of a prequel
user1: at least it filled in the back story in a fun way
user1: I wonder if they're going to make a sequel
user2: I hope so
user1: What do you think of Steve Buscemi?
user2: damn good actor
user1: I wouldn't have pegged Sully as coming from a privileged family
user2: i suppose
user1: but I could see that they would say that Mike wasn't scary enough
user2: oh yeah he way to funny to be scary
user1: He just wasn't built to be scary
user1: But Professor Hardscrabble was pretty scary
user2:  so was the boss from the first movie
user1: It was quite the deal they made to have a chance at staying at the University
user2: its a common theme in these sorts of movies
user1: Oozma Kappa was a great name for a monster fraternity
user2: sounds sortof slimely
user1: yep, pretty fitting
user1: The producer / directory did well to build the characters throughout the movie
user2: sucks that mike only won due to tampering
user1: Yep, he was taking the easy way out
user2: so in the end they both lose and win
user1: At least we see how they first started at Monsters Inc
user2: sounds good i should definitely watch it
user1: Yep, it's worth watching at least once
user1: especially if you liked the first one
user2: totally did i loved the whole movie

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello! I thought this was a great movie and lots of fun and god laughs.
user1: whats the name of the movie
user2: Monsters University! 
user1: is it a cartoon?
user2: Its a 3D computer animated movie
user2: Pixar did it for Walt Disney
user1: wow that sounds interesting 
user1: i love pixar movies
user1: what happens in the movie
user2: Its about two monsters and their first time in college together
user2: they start off as enemies and then become friends
user1: haha that sounds cute 
user1: is it a good plot for kids and adults
user2: Its a great plot for both age groups
user1: cool what is your fav part
user2: One of my favorite parts is when they both fight and break the Dean's treasured prize from her time at school
user1: do they get in trouble 
user2: They do they get kicked out of school 
user1: oh no do they get to go back
user2: They do, Mike one of the main characters makes a wager with the Dean. They have to win a college competition and if they win they are reinstated 
user1: haha what is the competition
user2: Its basically a "scare-athon" they have to do these different challenges as a team to show how "monstery" or scary they are
user1: are they scary?
user2: I wouldn't say they are super super scary, a young kid maybe around 3 might get scared
user2: but not a 10 year old
user2: they feel appropriate for the world of the movie
user1: god my kids are 10 - we will have to see it 
user1: good
user2: It teaches good lessons about not underestimating others, those physically weak and those physically strong, everyone has something to offer
user1: surely a must watch thanks 

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello! How are you?
user1: im ok , what about u?
user2: Fine thank you! Are you a fan of animation?
user1: not really
user1: i like thrilers better
user2: Would pixar be an exception for you because there is one particular film that combines both animation and thriller
user1: oh really?
user1: tell me about that
user2: Monsters University applies both and there is one really good scene throughout the film that applies it 
user1: oh fantastic 
user2: Would you give it try them?
user1: have u watched it?/
user1: ofcourse
user2: Definitely! In fact a few times? Have you seen the Monsters Inc.? 
user1: i might try to watch it this weekend

user1: is billy cristal in this one too?
user1: i meant as the voice
user1: and what was u favoite scene ?
user2: Yah all the voice actors return.  The scene that I mentioned earlier is my favorite. I sort of don't want to spoil it for you

user1: and is it PG ?
user1: i have a 2 year old ..
user1: i would to watch it with him
user1: if he lets me 
user2: And the main antagonist was pretty freaky! Your son will definitely like it. Does he like scary things?
user2: Helen Mirren voices the villain by the way

user1: oh  hmmm u made me want to watch it 
user1: ill see if i can do it this weekend
user2: Yeah Pixar makes some quality movies. It is an excellent movie for both you and your son.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi!
user2: What would you like to know?
user1: Is this an animated movie?
user2: Yes it is!
user1: Cool, do you know if it is a sequel?

conversation:
user1: Wow! I don't know about you, but Monsters University is one of my favorite Pixar films
user1: I thought it should have earned a higher rating than 79% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: hello
user2: It got an OK rating
user2: CinemaScore had an A, which is surpsiing
user2: since Rotton Tomato was so bad
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: Very true!
user1: I have. I really liked Squish Squibbles and the Oozma Kappa Fraternity
user2: hahah they are the fraternity members?
user1: Yes! They add a lot of other fun characters at the university, too.
user1: Helen Mirren was really amazingly intimidating as the Dean
user1: Have you seen the film
user2: I have, but so long ago that I don't rememver much
user2: it came out in 2013
user2: that was quite a bit of time ago
user2: It's a funny comedy though
user2: from what I remember
user1: You're right! It Feels like yesterday I saw it for the first time. 
user1: Can't believe it came out 12 years after Monsters Inc.
user2: That's so late! Monsters Inc was a true original though
user2: it was all 3d computer animated
user2: and didn't know it was by pixar
user2: do you know who the director was?
user1: The director of Monsters University is Don Scanlon. He didn't direct Monsters Inc but I can't remember who did!
user1: I thought he made the plot a lot of fun.
user1: I really related to young Mike Wazowski in Monsters U
user2: hahah I love Mike Wazowski
user2: and his voice!
user2: he was a 7 year old monster
user2: it was so funny when he enters the wrong room to scare at night
user2: I think Billy Crystal plays Mike in the movie
user1: Yes! Billy Crystal is an amazingly talented and funny comedian.
user1: He and John Goodman as Sully are such a perfect team
user2: I think that's why this movie was such a hit
user1: It was really cool seeing how they became friends in the prequel
user1: I agree
user2: I love the scare matches
user2: keep forgetting how those were a think
user2: thing
user2: The unviersity had scare games too
user2: didn't remember or realize hat
user1: Me too! It was so fun to see Oozma Kappa win against those jerks, Roar Omega Roar
user1: I love how much they improve thanks to Mike's coaching
user2: Isn't mike always known as not being scary enough?
user1: Yeah. It's really tragic since he wants to be a scarer so bad
user1: Sulley is definitely the scarier monster
user1: I bet his family of talented scarers would be really cool to see
user1: What did you think of the animation?
user2: I think the animation was great
user2: as a kid I loved it
user2: and in monster's university it's even better
user2: IN the final round, do they defeat Roar Omega Roar?
user1: Definitely! The colors and the monster designs get a lot more creative and visually stunning
user1: They do!
user1: It's a really satisfying moment
user1: Until they learn that Sulley cheated so they could win
user1: You should definitely watch the film again! It's always a good watch. 

conversation:
user1: Hi there! Happy Thursday!
user2: Hey!
user2: Have you seen Monsters University?
user1: I love Pixar movies! they are so well made. 
user1: Yes I have, have you/
user2: Yeah they are.
user2: Yes
user2: It got decent reviews as well
user1: I like the Monster Inc. better but this prequel is cute. 
user2: Has a A CinemaScore so the general audience liked it.
user2: The music by Randy Newman was good too.
user1: Yeah the reviews aren't too bad. I am not too familiar with CinemaScore but may need to check that site out.  I like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: I thought that learning about Mike and Sulley in college was interesting.
user2: Sulley was the popular one.
user1: It follows the story like of Mike wanting to be a monster scarer so badly. 
user2: Yeah, Sulley takes it easy, and Mike just isn't scary enough.
user2: Sulley comes from a talented family of scarers.
user1: yeah thats interesting. 
user1: Sully is everyone's favorite, like the big man on campus lol
user2: Yes he is
user2: The Scare Games were interesting
user1: yeah Sully kind of took them under his wing to help them
user2: It ends up being a frat battle.
user2: Kind of David vs Goliath
user1: I didn't recall that part in the movie where Sully had messed with the setting on the machine.
user2: I think I remember that vaguely.
user1: I may need to rewatch, I don't think my kid would mind lol
user2: Sulley had good intentions
user1: yeah, he did have good intentions, he was helping them but kind of hurting them in long run making them think they were better than they were. 
user2: It was interesting to see how they both got their jobs at Minsters Inc.
user2: *Monster's
user1: "The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually working theirway up to join the scarer team." so thats how they got to where they were.... 
user1: yeah it is!
user1: I do enjoy prequels and sequels
user2: It was a pretty safe movie overall, just like the review said.
user2: Well good conversation. 
user2: Have a good day!
user1: Yes, very family friendly
user1: good day to you too

conversation:
user2: Hi, i'm interested in watching a good movie, any recommendations?
user1: Hi! You should watch Monster's University. It got an A from Cinema Score
user2: Monster's University, never heard of it. What's the genre of this movie?
user1: It's an Animated Comedy.
user2: I like animation. Any famous cast members?
user1: There's a few! Billy Crystal plays Mike Wazowski and John Goodman plays James P. "Sulley" Sullivan. Other famous cast members include Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren, and Peter Sohn.
user2: Nice, was it nominated for any awards?
user1: No it was not. 
user2: Any idea of its IMDB score?
user1: No, but on Rotten Tomatoes it was given a 79% with an average of 6.8/10 and Metric Score gave it a 65/100.
user2: Interesting, is it suitable for kids under 8 years old
user1: Well it's from Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It depends on the child and how the parent feels.
user2: I See, can i get an idea of the plot?
user1: Monster's University is about two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying as "scare" majors while at college. At the start of the movie they are rivals and this movie follows how their relationship changes throughout the film.
user2: Does it have a predictable ending or is it a shocking one?
user1: I am not sure about that, but did you know this movie is actually a prequel to the 2001 Monsters, Inc ?
user2: I didn't know that, so i don't need to have watched the original one before watching this one, correct?
user1: Maybe you can check online! This movie was Pixar's first prequel film though. 
user2: Was this movie a box office success?
user1: I'm not sure about that but some critical responses include "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful."
user2: So it basically will leave the audience laughing out loud?
user1: Maybe you can check online! Did you know that there is a key scene I like where at the beginning Michael "Mike" Wazowski, a 7-year-old monster, aspires to become a scarer – a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy after seeing Monsters, Inc. Monstropolis' most profitable scaring company, on a school field trip. This is what prompts him to go to Monster's University!
user2: So would you personally recommend a family with a 5 year old and a 7 year old to go watch this movie?
user1: I like this movie, but there may be some scary parts since this movie is about Mike and Sulley being first year scare majors at Monster's University and they will be learning how to scare and scaring others in this movie. 
user2: Is there any memorable quote that this movie is famous for?
user1: Maybe you can check online! There are many memorable moments in the movie though, especially when Mike and Sulley try to join a fraternity on campus. 
user2: So is monster's university plot located on planet earth or on a fictitious location?
user1: A fictitious location.

user1: I LOVE BILLY CRYSTAL 
user2: Same here,it has been quite sometime since i have watched it.
user1: DO YOU AGREE ON THE RATING IT WAS GIVEN
user2: Yes i guess,i mean i think it is a pretty cute kids movie.
user1: YES MY KIDS ENOYED IT 
user1: DO LIKE THIS GENRE USUALLY
user1: IF I RECALL CORRECTLY BILLY CRYSTAL DID A GREAT JOB 
user2: I dont really watch a bunch of movies,i cant hardly sit still through a movie. I always seem to find other things that need to be done or something.
user1: IM NOT FAMILIAR WITHE THE OTHER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES
user1: BELIEVE ME I KNOW I FEEL THE SAME LIFE GETS BUSY UNLESS IM SITTING AT THE MOVIE THEATRE AND HAVE NO CHOICE
user2: If im not mistaken John Goodman is the guy from Roseanne if that helps ya figure him out
user1: AHH YES I WAS JUST GONNA ASK THIS
user1: YOU'RE CORRECT
user1: WHO IS HELEN MIRREN HER NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR 
user2: Remind me of Billy Krystal! Ive heard the name but can put a face to it

user1: I MIGHT WATCH IT TONIGHT WITH MY KIDS TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
user2: My oldest says Monster University is better than Monsters Inc.
user2: He is 7

conversation:
user1: Hello, have you seen Monsters University?
user2: I have but it has been awhile. It was a good movie.
user1: Yeah, it was a decent sequel to the original.
user2: Yeah. It is Disney movie and they usually do a good job with their movies.
user1: Yeah, it has pretty good scores. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 79%
user2: Yeah. For a comedy-animation film, they did a good job making it a funny squeal with good animation. 
user1: Yeah, Billy Crystal and John Goodman have great chemistry
user2: Yeah. They do and Dan Scanlon did a good job directing it as well. 
user1: Yeah, I agree. It's true to the spirit of the original Monsters Inc., but it still feels new
user2: Yeah. It is a cute movie that is funny and has colorful animation.
user1: Mike Wazowski is so cute as a little monster, I love that they showed his journey 
user2: Yeah. I like how you get to see how he met his friend Sulley.
user1: Yeah, I like how they show their progression into friendship. Sulley is a really privileged student and doesn't have to try and it's cool to see his connection to mike. 
user2: Yeah. It is fun to see them try to join a fraternity but only Sulley is accepted. 
user1: I like the Dean's character played by Helen Mirren as well. I thought she was a good addition. 
user2: Yeah. I also like the character of Squishy that is played by Peter Sohn.
user1: The whole scare games sequence is really fun too
user1: It makes the stakes higher when they make a deal that if they loose they have to leave the university.
user2: Yeah. I like that Mike enters the Scare Games by joining the Oozma Kappa team, the weakest fraternity on campus.  
user1: Right. It's a little sad when you figure out he only won the scare portion because Sulley had to tamper with the machine. 
user2: Yeah but it is fun to see how they improved up to that point with the help of Mike and his training and knowledge of scaring. 
user1: Yeah, it shows he knows how it's executed just that he can't physically do it. 
user1: I liked also seeing Randal as a nerdy sort of character, voiced by Steve Buscemi
user2: Yeah. For a film that came out in 2013 it has enough of the stuff you need to make it haunt the imagination long after the buzz of its fluffy-furred cutness has gone away. 
user1: I was glad to see the other students in Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program
user2: Yeah and that Hardscrabble praises Sully and Mike and says that they were the first students to surprise her. 
user1: I like that they took regular jobs in the mailroom in Monsters Inc. 
user2: Yeah which leads them to finally join the scarer team and up to were the first movie starts. 
user1: Right, i thought it was cool that they did a prequel instead of a sequel
user2: It was a good prequel overall and that also got a CinemaScore of an A.

user2: neverrrrr!

user2: i think the lion king is the best movie of disney!

user1: Are the voice artists famous?
user2: have you heard of billy crystal and john goodman?
user2: they play the main two characters
user1: Oh great! Those are good actors
user2: the music is composed by randy newman 
user1: Hmm, interesting. I haven't heard of him
user2: he's composed music for 7 other pixar films
user1: Wow, so it's Pizar
user1: Oops, I mean pixar
user1: How much money did the film make?
user2: it's a prequel to the other pixar film, monsters inc
user1: Oh I love those movies
user2: I'm not sure of that.
user1: I see 
user1: Would you reccommend the movie?
user2: I would
user2: it's a great prequel to the original, it matches it's tone
user1: Awesome. 
user1: Is it still in theaters?
user2: it's not, it was released in 2013
user1: I see, well thank you for the information!

conversation:
user2: Hello! Are you a fan of disney pixar?
user1: I am!
user2: Have you seen Monsters university, the sequel to Monsters Inc?
user1: I have once. It's pretty good, though the first was better I think.
user2: I agree. I did enjoy it, and it was funny to see them in college
user1: Yeah, and one thing I really liked about it was that it had the message that NOT everyone is good at everything, but different people have different talents. 
user1: It wasn't about Mike becoming a great "scarer" but rather realizing what he was actually really good at.
user2: Oh yes, I completely agree! It always makes me laugh to see Sully's personality in college, he was a jerk 
user1: He really was arrogant. And he had to learn that it's ok to be proud, but to not be arrogant about being good at something, which is a good message too. 
user2: Are you a fan of John Goodman?
user2: I completely agree. He was way too cocky.
user1: I don't know if I've thought about it much. But i guess I do like several of his movies.
user2: Yeah he's a pretty decent actor in my opinion. 
user1: O Brother Where Art Thou is a big favorite of mine
user2: I've never seen that. Is it good?
user1: It's great. It's a Coen Brothers film (not sure if I spelled that right) 
user2: Oh, I'll have to look into that! 
user1: But it's loosely based on Homer's Oddessy, but set in the South during the Great Depression. John Goodman plays a cyclops-inspired character. 
user2: I think we have to keep talking about Monsters University. Lol 
user2: Oh that sounds interesting. My husband likes that movie I think. 
user1: Oops, sorry. lol
user2: No, not your fault! I got off track too. There's not much to speak about since we've both seen it haha
user2: What would you rate it out of ten?
user1: Well one thing that did disapoint me about Monsters university is that it sort of messed with the fact that in the original Monsters Inc, Mike or Sully mentioned being friends in 4th grade, so that disrupted the time line. But for the story itself, I liked it.
user1: Hm. Probably 7.7 out of 10
user2: Oh wow, I didn't even notice that! Good catch. 
user1: 7.5 I meant. mistyped
user2: I'll have to watch it again and see if I notice. I'd give a 6 or 7 out of ten 
user1: I like the message, like I said...it's not a generic "everyone can do everything!" which would be false, but rather a "find what YOU are good at" thing. 
user1: But the pacing isn't perfect.
user2: that's true. I found myself kind of bored at times.
user1: Yeah, it didn't have that smooth a to b to c arc
user2: I agree. Nice chatting with you! Have a good day!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi, I guess I'm talking to you about Monsters University. It's an animated family movie made by Pixar. It was produced after Monsters, Inc but is supposed to be a prequel. It stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman. 
user1: What were the critical reviews like?
user2: They pretty much said it was good but unoriginal. Colorful but "predicatable". 
user1: Have you seen it? Do you agree?
user2: I have seen it and I guess I tend to agree. My kids really enjoyed it but it didn't bring anything new or exciting. I can take it or leave it.
user1: What did your kids like about it?
user2: Recognizing the characters and getting to know them even better. It also had funny parts.
user1: What part did you find the funniest?
user2: At this moment I honestly couldn't tell you. But I do know I laughed at the time of watching it.
user1: When was the last time you watched it?
user2: I would say it's been almost two years.
user1: If you were to give me a reason to watch this movie, what would it be?
user2: If you're looking for a wholesome family movie that's safe for the kids to watch and is overall enjoyable, it would be a good choice.
user1: How does it compare to other Pixar works?
user2: It isn't as good. I would give it a C+ if I were to compare it to other Pixar movies.
user1: Are there any scenes in it you found memorable?
user2: When they realize that frightening the children isn't the answer.
user1: What was memorable about that scene?
user2: I feel that was the turning point of the movie where they then try to make things right.
user1: Which scenes did your kids like the best?
user2: The race at the end 
user1: Why did they like that scene?
user2: The action
user1: What kind of action?
user2: Them running around and doing their scavenger hunt? It was something like that.
user1: Is there anything else you can tell me about this movie?
user2: Not really. It's been a while since I've seen it and it didn't really stand out to me.

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: hello
user1: What movie are we talking about?
user2: Monsters University
user1: Oh that's a great movie. I saw that in theaters
user2: I watched it with my kids.  We tend to watch it a lot
user1: It's strange that they made a prequel to a pixar film.
user2: not for me.  I actually thought it was good for a sequel
user2: most don't work out
user1: yes.
user1: Who played Wozowski?
user2: billy crystal of course
user1: OH yea he did a real good job
user2: yes.  I can't think of anyone better for that part.  His voice made the character
user1: It really did.
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie
user2: I liked the beginning.  It was really great that they started off when they were younger
user1: Yes
user1: What about those drills. They were really funny.
user2: yes they were
user1: Remember the party 
user2: yes I do
user1: That was a real fun part of the movie.
user2: It was one of my twins favorite as well
user1: oh really
user1: What did you think of Bogg's backstory
user2: it was great
user1: I didn't expect him to be a nerd before
user2: Neither did I
user1: I thought he was always just evil
user2: me too

conversation:
user1: hello there
user2: hi
user1: we're going to be talking about Monsters Universit
user1: y
user2: Yes, I have seen this movie
user2: Have you?
user1: yes i have, what did you think of the prequel? 
user2: I thought it was pretty good
user2: I'd watch it again
user1: did you like this one better than the original?
user2: No, the original was much better
user2: what about you?
user1: I agree, I feel people were waiting for the sequel instead, with Boo
user2: hehe I love Boo!
user1: she was great, I've heard they might be making that in the future

conversation:
user2: Hi
user2: What movie are we discussing this morning?
user1: Hello!
user1: Monsters Inc
user1: have you seen it?
user2: No I haven't.  Have you?
user1: I have quite a few years ago
user1: It's a Disney movie
user1: so if you are a Disney fan, it's def worth watching
user2: I haven't seen any animated kids movies in years either.
user2: will keep that in mind next time I'm looking for something kid friendly
user1: this one is from 2013 and i believe they are making another one
user2: What's it about?
user1: if you are a fan of billy crystal or john goodman their voices are used for the new main characters
user2: John Goodman yes, Billy Crystal not so much
user2: Is that the movie minions came from?
user1: it's a cute movie about a monster who wants to become a "scarer" which basically is a monster who enters kids rooms and scares them, but he's not a scary monster so he has to go to this monster university to become a scary monster and he meets his good monster pal there
user1: i believe so
user2: lol that does sound cute
user2: I will look for it on netflix......
user1: it's super cute. when i was a kid disney was all about the classics and princesses so it's nice that they have a new genre now a days for the kids
user2: Same, Pixar changed everything. 
user2: Took kids to see the Toy Story movies, then they grew out of animation. 
user1: i didn't know this but helen miren is also a voice in the movie. it's crazy how many well known "actors" use their voices for these things
user1: Toy Story was a classic
user1: i even think they did a new one of that
user1: it's so hard to keep up with because there's another a new fad or movie that the kids go crazy about every year or so
user1: i remember how insane the frozen fad was
user1: my nieces went crazy
user2: I just saw references to it everywhere, never saw it.  
user2: teased nephew that he was getting frozen dolls for xmas
user2: Will keep an eye out for Monsters, Inc.  sounds like it could be funny, there's always some adult humor hidden in those kids movies.
user1: there really is
user1: monsters inc has a lot of good humor too for adults
user1: i'm surprised it didn't end up bigger than it really was
user2: Will look for it.
user1: i even saw it in the theater (not sure why) but i loved it
user2: cool.  
user2: I always liked John Goodman, he has a distinctive voice that would work well with animation I think.
user2: I'm assuming it was rated G?
user1: 100% he always makes me laugh and the character he plays is perfect in the movie. it's a big old monster who can't scary anyone 
user2: good convo, have a great day!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user1: Have you seen Monster University? 
user2: No, i saw the original Monsters Inc!
user2: But we will discuss non the less!
user1: Oh, ok
user1: I haven't seen either 
user2: So this is a Pixar film. I do love Pixar
user1: I guss
user1: The movie sound good though
user1: I like animated films as well 
user2: Looks like this movie was the first time that Pixar actually made a prequel film. Monsters Inc being the original
user1: Yeah
user1: The casts for this movie don't seem bad
user2: Looks like they have weaved the elements of Monsters Inc. into this film nicely.
user1: ... Bill Christal, Noah Johnson etc
user1: It seems so
user1: Animated comedies are always nice to watch
user2: Mike Wazowski, played by billy crystal was one of two main characters in the film. Looks like they have used mikes early days at Monsters Inc company as a platform for him now being at Monsters university. 
user1: Yeah. It can be found on Rotten Tomatoes- 79% ratings
user1: Directed by Dan Scanlon 
user2: That Rotten Tomatoes rating doesnt surprise me. If anything I would have guessed that it would have been a little bit higher. 90s maybe.
user1: It came out in 2013
user2: Pixar always does a fantastic job. 
user1: Yeah
user1: 79% is not bad regardless 
user2: This animation has all the competitiveness and machismo that you would expect from college fraternities. 
user1:  Yes I agree
user1: Even the title alone is catching 
user1: ...Monster University 
user1: :)
user2: And of course there is always the nerds vs the jocks dynamic going on. Looks that's mike wazowski vs Sulley Sulivan in this film.
user1: Maybe
user1: It's always good to get a good laugh 
user1: Especially with animated movies
user2: Oh yeah, Billy crystal and John Goodman are both excellent at this type of comedy. Monsters Inc.. is a classic for most people, adults and kids alike.  
user1: They are
user1: The story line is a good one
user1: A 7 year old monster aspires to become a scarer 
user2: Even though they both get expelled from the university, i'm glad they find their way back to Monsters Inc... Even if that means they have to work their way back to being on the scare team. That's a great story line.
user1: That's right
user1: But it so happens, Mike the aspiring scaring monster does not scare enough 
user2: Sulley had a natural gift as a scarer. He was very big and intimidating where as Mike is small and round. Mike has the work on the mechanics of scaring whereas Sulley just does it naturally.
user2: Well, nice talking to you!
user1: You too

user2: Thanks for telling me about it. I am interested in watching.
user1: Critical Response
user1: "is true to the spirit of [Monsters, Inc.] and matches its tone. But it never seems content toturn over old ground."
user1: "It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz ofits fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result."
user1: "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful."
user1: "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedgesits bets."
user1: Key Scenes..
user1: Michael "Mike" Wazowski, a 7-year-old monster, aspires to become a scarer – a monsterwho enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy– when he grows up after visiting Monsters Inc., Monstropolis' most profitable scaringcompany, on a school field trip.
user1: Eleven years later, Mike is a first-year scare major atMonsters University, where he meets fellow monster, James P. "Sulley" Sullivan.
user1: Mikestudies hard, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, reliesonly on his natural ability and begins to falter.
user1: As the semester progresses, Mike and Sulleyattempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the strongestfraternity on campus.
user1: At the semester's final exam, a fight between the two causes them toaccidentally break Dean Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished Scream Can.
user1: Hardscrabble failsboth of them immediately, stating that Sulley does not study enough, and Mike is not scaryenough.
user2: Great
user1: Have you seen the 1st one?
user2: Yes I have
user1: This is probably as good as the first. more laughs
user1: i like the monsters designs
user2: Yes, I enjoyed the first film very much so I'm sure I will like the sequel. 
user1: more key scenes...
user1: Wanting to prove himself, Mike enters the university's "Scare Games", and makes a wagerwith Hardscrabble to reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Mikemust leave the university if they lose.
user1: He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, theweakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one teammember short.
user1: short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket backinto the scare program.
user1: Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge, but are saved fromelimination after another team is disqualified for cheating.
user1: cheating. Oozma Kappa improve graduallydue to Mike's training and intricate knowledge of scaring, and they advance through eachfollowing challenge, finishing just behind Roar Omega Roar.
user1: In the final round, they defeatRoar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom.
user1: However,Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley tampered with the machine's difficultyto the easiest setting.

user1: Disney, as the rights holder, had plans for a sequel to Monsters, Inc. since 2005. Following disagreements with Pixar, Disney tasked its Circle 7 Animation unit to make the film.[8] An early draft of the film was developed; however, Disney's purchase of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7's version of the film.[9] A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010,[6] and in 2011, it was confirmed that the film would instead be a prequel titled Monsters University.[10]
user1: Monsters University premiered on June 5, 2013 at the BFI Southbank in London, England, and was released on June 21, 2013, in the United States.

user2: I have not
user2: thanks for telling me :)
user2: I have seen Monsters Inc.
user2: Have you sen monsters University?
user1: I have seen it. I loved it. It is the prequel to Monster's Inc.
user2: I have seen parts of it because I am a big Disney/Pixar fan
user2: I always go to Disneyland. They even have a ride based on it in California Adventures
user1: I love Pixar! Does the ride have Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski? He is the little green guy...
user2: Yes they do. The voice of Mike Wazowski is Billy Crystal. And the voice of James Sullivan is John Goodman 
user2: Have you seen Monsters Inc?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello!
user1: we will be talking about Monsters University
user1: I LOVE this movie
user2: Cool, I haven't seen that one. What can you tell me about it?
user1: It came out in 2013. There is a Monsters inc movie and Monsters University is a part two 
user1: It's Comedy/Animation
user2: What's it about?
user1: It's a children's movie BUT i think adults love it too. At least i do.
user1: There are two main characters
user1: monsters Mike and Sulley
user2: Ok, and what do they do?
user1: They always wanted to work for monsters inc (the big company where monsters scare children and children's screams are collected and it's the source of electricity in the Monstropolis)
user1: Mike is very educated but not scary and he really wanna be a scaring monster
user1: and sully is scary but he doesn't wanna study because he thinks he is scary enough
user1: do you care about ratings?
user2: Ohh, I see.
user1: Rotten tomatoes 79%, Metacritic 65/100
user2: Well, I usually look at the ratings, but it isn't my main motivation
user1: Honestly, i think the ratings for this movie should be higher
user2: Can you tell me who play the main characters?
user1: It's really funny
user1: yes
user1: Billy Crystal as Mike
user1: John Goodman as Sulley
user1: Steve Buscemi as Randall
user2: Wow, good actors there
user1: yes. they did a great job
user2: But isn't it cruel that these guys are trying to scare children?
user1: it is
user1: but
user1: in monsters inc (the first movie) they get attached to a little girl and they realize that its wrong
user1: and also they realize that children's laughter produces more electricity that scream
user1: You've never even heard about this movie?
user2: Ohh, that's a great idea.
user2: I've heard of it, but thought it wasn't really funny
user1: I've watched both movies million times :) i think it's really funny
user2: And I didn't know it's good for adults too. Does it have some hidden jokes in there?
user1: i don't think so. 
user1: do you care about critics response?
user2: I'd like to know what they think of the movie
user1: Its cute and funny and the animation though not exactly inspired. it's certainly colorful
user1: this is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its belts
user1: i disagree with critics though
user1: i mean yes it's safe and somewhat predictable but it's a movie for kids so what do they expect
user1: Do you like these types of movies?
user2: Umm... Well, most kids movies would have the same critiques, so I think it doesn't hurt my chances of watching this movie
user2: Yes, there are really good animated movies

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: hi!! 
user2: have you seen this movie before? 
user1: What movie is it? 
user2: monsters university 
user2: the prequel to monsters inc.  
user1: I would be interested in watching this movie! What is the plot? 
user1: and where would I go to watch this movie? 
user2: it is an animated movie about two monsters starting college 
user2: and their struggles to find their place at the school 
user2: I am sure it is online somewhere maybe amazon or netflix I am not positive 
user2: it is meant to be a kids movie but I think it is very entertaining for adults as well 
user2: it was given 79% on rotten tomatoes but I think it deserved better 
user2: I am really big fan of animated pixar movies are you? 
user1: I am a big fan of pixar movies! 
user1: i enjoyed the Incredibles and Monsters Inc.
user1: So I think I would really enjoy watching this movie. 
user1: Is this movie suitable for all ages? 
user1: I want to make sure it is a wholesome movie that I can watch at home
user2: I think you would really like it especially if you liked monsters inc.  
user2: yes it is suitable for all ages! and a good message for both kids and adults 
user1: great! 
user1: That is good to hear
user1: i appreciate the information you gave me
user2: of course! 
user1: I will definitely look into this and see about watching it in the future
user2: the movie is about making the best out of the situation 
user1: wow, that is a positive message
user2: trying to stay positive no matter the circumstances! 
user1: Yes positivity is great
user2: also that if you work hard you can achieve anythin 
user2: anything* 
user1: another great attribute of a movie is a good message that helps you think about life
user2: also it shows the development of friendship between the two characters, the importance of leaning on others for love and support 
user1: I respect that, and I think this movie will be in my queue for the future
user1: You mentioned this movie was on Netflix or Amazon
user1: would I need to pay to watch this movie? 
user2: one of those movies that makes you feel good after you watch it 

conversation:
user2: hello I like this movie as it is a prequesl to Monsters INC
user2: It really lets you see how they met and got together and started working together as friends
user1: I liked it too
user1: I love John Goodman as Sulley
user2: It remained fresh without rehashing old stuff. Yes loved John Goodman and Billy Crystal. A good pairing
user2: I see it got good reviews by rotton tomatos and cinamascore
user1: I can't believe this was the first time Pixar did a prequel
user2: Yes, you have to make a lot of money for a studio to look at a picture and think sequel let alone prequel
user1: I also can't believe Helen Mirren was in it. She's great
user2: I liked steve buscemi as well. great character actor
user2: Its good for young kids, its safe and they say easy to watch
user1: Yeah Randall is a great character
user2: Mike wazoski got the bug from the school trip to Monsters Inc and decided he was going to be a scarer
user2: Interesting how mike studies hard, but john goodmans character assumes its in the genes and slacks 
user1: I liked the dynamic of the story. Having Sulley be from a long line of scarers really made it interesting
user2: right. it was in sullys genes. big and scary
user2: and sully got into the top house on campus, along with his size look and legacy
user1: It was cool to have that play off of  Mike's longing to be a scarer
user2: poor mike always studying hard, but that does not make a good scarer
user2: interesting that they both failed, one from slacking not studying enough, and one not being scary enough
user1: The whole fraternity storyline reminded me of older comedies so I got a kick out of it
user2: making that bet with hardscrabble by saying if he scores top at the scare games to get back in the school was smart but bold
user2: and of course mike joins the weak fraternity
user1: It gave a lot of weight to the games that he would have to leave the school if he lost though
user1: It really raised the stakes
user2: I agree. Mikes training and studying came in to help the weak fraternity in the games
user2: sully really helped by cheating in the game in the final contest helping Mike
user1: Yeah, but it's too bad Sulley tampered with the machine in the last round
user2: well while they did not get what they directly wanted they still got into monsters Inc in the mail room 
user2: after they got kicked out of the school
user1: I love that they didn't win in the end, but that it ties into them starting to work for Monsters inc
user2: but hardscrabble actually respected them in the end 
user1: It was a great lead in to the first film
user2: they simply got into monsters u using a different path
user1: Yeah, they were the first students to ever surprise Hardscrabble
user2: and they ended up as friends and that slid right into the next movie
user2: I like how they had to slowly work for it
user1: It was cool that the others from their frat got into the scare program though
user2: right. a selfless act by Mike
user2: I like how the movie is safe and predictable for kids
user2: it came out in 2013...already a while ago
user2: the metacritic score is pretty high as well
user1: Yeah it was a good film and matched the first film's tone pretty well
user2: it shows that relying only on your natural abilities can lead you to falter. You have to also work at it
user1: I always kind of forget that Pixar is a part of Disney 
user1: It must be the 3D
user2: dan scanlon is also a good director...must be tough to direct an animation
user1: and yeah 2013 seems like a while ago, but can you believe the Monster's Inc came out in 2001?
user1: that's 12 years between it and the prequel. wow
user2: no i cant that was a while ago, working on 20 years!
user2: the prequel is seemless showing how they got to be the big scarer team in the first movie. Mike thinks things through, and sully provides the brawn. That is unstoppable
user1: And they started off as rivals, that was really interesting
user2: one critic said its cute and funny. Good enough for my kids
user1: yeah and it lends to the imagination
user2: I do see somewhat of a vieled insult though, this movie was safe and bland from a studio that does not often hedge its bets. But hey the movie is exactly what people wanted
user1: safe worked for this movie though. Even though it was predictable the tone worked well
user1: thanks for the conversation about this great movie
user2: sure its been real. Love this flick

user1: You’re right about that.
user1: It’s definetely fun and lighthearted 
user2: Definitely. I think I liked the other Monsters movies more but this one was super fun.
user1: Really?
user1: I guess I liked this one more compared to the others
user2: Yeah I don't know, they're all really fun. I think that I liked the scare games part the most.

user2: Yeah, overall it got a 79% on Rotten Tomatoes so definitely good.
user1: Definetely
user1: Do you have CinemaScore’s?
user2: Yep, got an A on that and a 65/100 on Metacritic. So pretty good!
user1: Well, it’s too bad for Metacritic
user1: Do you know who voices the monsters?
user2: Metacritic has differently weighted scores, so anything above 50 is pretty good 
user2: Yeah it's Billy Crystal, John Goodman as the two main guys.
user2: And then Steve Buscemi and Helen Mirren as some of the others.
user1: John Goodman?
user2: Yeah he's in a bunch of stuff.
user2: Roseanne most recently
user1: Iwow, that’s a great cast
user1: I never would have imagined
user2: Very good, probably why the movie is good.
user1: Wow, this is a pleasant surprise
user1: So, do you have any interesting facts about the movie?
user2: What do you want to know?

conversation:
user1: Hi! How are you?
user2: Hi there, good how are you?
user1: Great! Thanks for asking! So what movie will we be discussing today?
user2: Monsters University!
user1: Oh cool! I haven't seen that one. What can you tell me about it?
user2: It's a pixar animation from 2013 that was the prequel to the movie Monsters Inc. from 2001. The plot is of two monsters, Mike and Sulley during their time at University. They start off as enemies but slowly become friends through rivals.
user1: That sounds very interesting! Do you know who voices the characters of Mike and Sully?
user2: Billy Crystal is the voice of Mike and John Goodman is the character Sulley!
user2: Noah Johnston also voices as young Mike!
user1: They are all three great actors! I especially like Billy and John! Do you know who directed the movie?
user2: The movie was directed by Dan Scanion!
user1: Awesome! How did the critics react to the movie?
user2: Scanlon *
user1: He's a great director!
user2: The critics all seemed to love the movie! Many saw it as a cute and funny animation that matches the tone of the previous movie!
user1: That's so cool. I know critics can be harsh so if they like a film then it must be great! Do you know what score Cinemascore and Rotten Tomatoe's gave it?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gave it 79% and average 6.8/10 and CinemaScore gave it an A!
user1: Not bad at all! Sounds like a great movie! Any interesting plot points you want to share?
user2: It shows there attempts to join into a fraternity although only sulley gets accepted into the strongest fraternity. 
user2: Theres also games that the fraternities on campus get to play in to get into the scare program!
user1: Oh cool! Do you know the name of the fraternity?
user2: It's called Roar Omega Roar!
user1: That sounds very interesting and humorous! What happens next?
user2: Mike and Sulley create their own fraternity called Oozma Kappa, however they are taken away by the CDA and expelled because of their cheating at the games while the other members of the fraternity got accepted into the scare program for next year.
user1: Oh that's a real bummer for them! Do they at least get a happy ending?
user2: They both decide to take jobs in the mail room at Monsters Inc and eventually work their way up to the scare team there!
user1: That's awesome. Despite being fantasy, it has real world conflict to it. Who else voices some of the characters?
user2: Definitely! Steve Buscemi voices the character Randy, Helen Mirren as Dean Abigail the chair of Scarer program at the University and Peter Sohn as Scotty Squibbles one of the Oozma Kappa members.
user1: Wow! Some renowned names there. The movie definitely sounds worth watching. Anything else you'd like to add about it?
user1: I enjoyed discussing Monsters university with you. I definitely plan on watching it thanks to you! Have a great day!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hi there
user2: i wanted to recommend you a movie
user2: Have you heard of Monsters University?
user1: I have heard of Monsters University but I have not seen it.
user1: I have seen Monsters Inc. though.
user2: actually its similar
user2: its also animated as well
user2: anything you want to know about it?
user1: I am a big fan of animated movies.  What kind of ratings did this movie get?
user2: well the ratings weren't super great to be honest. Metacritic gave it a 65 out of 100
user2: and rotten tomatoes gave it a 79% score 
user2: I don't agree with the critics though. A critic is just that after all.
user1: I would have expected higher ratings from a Pixar movie.  That surprises me.  
user1: Who are the lead voice actors?
user2: right, surprises me too.
user2: It stars Billy crystal
user2: John Goodman
user2: Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren and Peter Sohn
user1: I love all of them.
user1: That is a great cast!
user1: Who was the director?
user2: Dan Scanion! So you know it'll be good
user2: Also I must mention
user2: its actually a prequel to Monsters Inc. So it will have a familiar feeling
user1: Interesting to make a prequel, instead of a sequel.  So does this take place in Mike and Sully's younger years?
user2: Yes I believe so
user2: It's about how the monsters as young kids aspire to be scary. 
user2: It goes through their time at a type of "monster university" that teaches them how to be scary and how to interact with humans
user1: That sounds really cute.
user1: I would love to see those characters as kids.
user2: Haha I'd say
user1: The original is one of my favorites.
user2: Yes same here
user2: I thought this one was good though despite the reviews
user1: Do you know if it one any awards?
user1: Is there anything else you think I should know about it?
user2: I'm not sure if it won any awards
user2: but it's definitely a good go-to movie if you want something familiar, fun, and safe for all audiences.
user1: Well thanks I think you've informed me a lot on this movie.
user1: It's always nice to have a movie in mind that is good for all ages.
user1: Feel good movies are a nice break too.
user1: I will have to make a point of watching it.
user2: I agree, the world is in a bad spot lol good to have some light watching available
user2: nice chatting
user2: goodbye!
user1: Goodbye

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: hi
user2: Let's talk monsters university
user1: Ok!
user2: Monsters University​ is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by PixarAnimation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.[6]
user1: Wow, I love Disney movies
user1: tell me more
user2: It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced byKori Rae, with John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich as executiveproducers.
user1: What is it about?
user2: Monsters Universitytells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying at college, where theystart off as rivals, but slowly become best friends.
user2: John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as James P. Sullivan, Mike Wazowski
user1: It seems like a wholesome movie, I would love to see it
user2: Here's the beginning scene
user2: Michael "Mike" Wazowski, a 7-year-old monster, aspires to become a scarer – a monsterwho enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy– when he grows up after visiting Monsters Inc., Monstropolis' most profitable scaringcompany, on a school field trip.
user1: What happens to make him want to go? Did someone inspire him?
user2: Not sure
user2: Eleven years later, Mike is a first-year scare major atMonsters University, where he meets fellow monster, James P. "Sulley" Sullivan. Mikestudies hard, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, reliesonly on his natural ability and begins to falter.
user1: He sounds stuck up
user2: ha yeah
user2: As the semester progresses, Mike and Sulleyattempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the strongestfraternity on campus. At the semester's final exam, a fight between the two causes them toaccidentally break Dean Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished Scream Can. Hardscrabble failsboth of them immediately, stating that Sulley does not study enough, and Mike is not scaryenough.
user1: Do they manage to get back into the university?
user2: yeah
user2: Wanting to prove himself, Mike enters the university's "Scare Games", and makes a wagerwith Hardscrabble to reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Mikemust leave the university if they lose.
user2: He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, theweakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one teammember short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket backinto the scare program.
user1: Oh so that's how they get back in, they must've won!
user1: What challenges did they have to do?
user2: Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge, but are saved fromelimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. Oozma Kappa improve graduallydue to Mike's training and intricate knowledge of scaring, and they advance through eachfollowing challenge, finishing just behind Roar Omega Roar.
user2: In the final round, they defeatRoar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom. However,Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley tampered with the machine's difficultyto the easiest setting.
user1: Oh no! so they ended up cheating too 
user2: cheats all around
user1: Did anyone find out? Did Mike tell the headmaster about it?
user2: Mike and Sulley are led away by the CDA, and are expelled from the university as a resultof their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scareprogram the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in theGames.
user1: Oh wow

conversation:
user2: Hi
user2: Are you still there?
user1: Hi, i love the cast of this movie. Billy Crystal is so funny.
user2: Actually I haven't watch that movie before.
user2: Do you?
user1: I have seen it. My kids love the movie so i have seen it over and over lol\
user2: Great. 
user2: Tell me something about this movie.
user1: i think mike and Sulley the monsters in monster Inc, this shows them going through school to learn about being monsters
user1: Those 2 monsters mike and sulley become best friends 
user2: I think you are great story teller.
user1: thank you
user2: Do you agree with the ratings given by the rotten tomatoes?
user1: no i think the ratings should be higher
user2: I think 79 % is high enough for an animated comedy film.
user2: Who is your favorite character in this movie?
user1: it starts with a 7yr old monster who want to be a scarer, which is a monster who enters the human world at night to scare kids
user1: I like Mike. 
user2: Looks like its an interesting movie.
user1: the movie even has a fraternity lol
user2: Really? So tell me something about it.
user1: it is called Roar Omega Roar
user1: it is the strongest fraternity on campus
user1: Sulley got into it but Mike didn't
user2: And who is the leader of that fraternity?
user1: Mike got in Oozma Kappa the weakest fraternity on campus
user1: I am not sure who is in charge
user2: Is Mike your favorite character of the movie?
user1: yes
user1: Mike and sulley get expelled from the university
user2: I think Mike and Sulley are the main character of that movie.
user2: Why did they get expelled
user1: cuz they broke Hardscrbbles scream can
user2: Tell me other interesting scene of that movie.
user1: Mike and sulley get jobs in the mail room of Monsters Inc but eventually work their way up to join the scarer team
user1: I really like how Sulley ran after the bus Mike got on to leave the university after getting expelled just to raise his spirits
user1: then Hardscrabble appears to wish them luck claiming that they were the first students to surprise her
user1: Great kids movie, but a great movie for adults also
user1: So what do you think of the movie from what you read about it?
user1: you still there?
user1: Hello Are you there?
user1: Hello
user1: Hello
user1: You there?
user1: Hello

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi how are you?
user1: Great. You?
user2: Pretty good, thanks. Billy Crystal has always been a hoot, have you seen this movie?
user1: Not really. 
user2: I think it has good animation graphics, I at least remember the large blue character
user1: Oh okey
user1: What's the movie name?
user2: Monster's University
user1: Nice
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: looks like the music composer has worked with other Pixar films before
user1: I see
user1: I like funny movies
user2: oh, so the blue creature is an abominable snowman
user1: Okey
user1: Tell me more
user2: I guess this is the 2nd installment of Monsters Inc, seems cute and colorful
user1: Wow
user1: What's the rating?
user2: So the monsters are in college now-taking final exams
user1: Nice
user2: 79% for Rotten TOmatoes
user1: Not bad
user1: Is it any funny?
user2: Says here this is the 14th Pixar film-I haven't seen it
user1: Oh
user2: Oh wow the characters are frat members and everything-how cute
user1: Might be worth checking out. 
user2: So, one of the monsters enters the human world to harvest screams-kind of ceepy
user2: creepy
user1: Really Creepy 
user2: One of the characters is names Hardscrabble
user1: Funny name
user1: I can't even pronounce it. 
user1: :)
user2: Sulley comes from a family of talented scarers lol
user1: I see
user1: Sounds funny though.
user2: I'm sure it is,
user1: Yep
user2: I wonder what a scream can is?
user1: Can't say
user2: seems like the scariest monster is most respected
user1: I'm not surprised 
user2: Lokks like the university has "Scare games"
user1: Since one has to be scarer 
user1: Oh
user2: ok, so the actors are Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi
user2: Helen Mirren
user2: and Peter Sohn
user1: Nice
user2: do you know of them?
user1: Bill is pretty good
user1: Yeah somewhat 
user2: yes he is
user1: Yep
user1: Not sure about Peter though 
user2: the critics said "it has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination..."
user1: Nice
user2: "edge-free"
user1: I see
user2: "safe and predictable"
user1: Wow
user2: this movie came out in 2013, I think it would be a good watch for you
user1: I think so too
user2: did you have any questions?
user1: Not really
user2: ok then, I hope you have a good day!
user1: Oh, are going to see it? 
user1: You too

conversation:
user2: Hey!  i saw Rotten Tomatoes gave Monsters University 79%! 
user2: Of course, Cinemascore gave it an A, so I think it might be worth it.  Have you seen it?
user1: Hi, yea they don't seem impressed.
user1: No, I have never seen this.
user2: I'm not sure why.  Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski... can't go wrong!
user1: Meta Critic only gives it 65, that's not low or high.
user2: True, it is middle of the road... I find it amazing that Helen Mirren does a voice too...
user1: John Goodman is always good.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Nope. Heck yeah for John Goodman.  The critics seem to be saying it was 'bland' and 'safe'
user1: Some of the comments describe it as cute and colorful, I'm sure kids will love it regardless.
user2: Oh sure, and the story of the characters years at university seems like a decent storyline.
user1: It's in 3D, would you pay to see it in 3D?
user2: Not sure... the story is more compelling to me than 'effects' or such.  Apparently, it starts when Mike is only 7 an then goes on to him as a scare major at university.  Cute.
user1: It does sound like a cute movie with the whole monster university plot line.
user2: Apparently they even try to join a fraternity called 'Roar Omega Roar'... !
user1: Their attempt to join a fraternity mirrors real life in a way that could teach a lesson.
user2: Well, seeing as only Sulley gets in I can see how it might be a definite twist in the plot, that's for sure... Then, of course, they break the Dean's Scream Can, resulting in both of them being failed.... definite lessons in there
user1: Definitely
user2: Apparently, the next bit has them entering the 'scare games' with a team on a bet with the dean to get back into the program
user1: Scare Games sounds like it will be interesting and entertaining.
user2: Yes, they are with a group called Oozma Kappa who are misfits I guess... and then they do the underdog getting better and coming up to try to win thing...
user1: How do you think Mike will feel when he finds they only won because Sully tampered with the machine?
user2: Another twist, right?., when Mike finds out Sulley cheated by tampering with the difficulty setting... could prove devastating...
user1: Yea, it will probably create conflict that will contribute to the plot.
user2: Expulsion for Sulley and Mike follows but not Oozma Kappa, so there's that... 
user2: Of course, then we see they started as mail clerks at Monsters Inc, which is sort of ... weak there at the end I guess... but sort of keeping it real... you cheat, you have consequences... 
user1: Consequences for actions, makes the plot interesting.
user2: Yes, Mike and Sulley taking responsibility for their actions does sort of make for an interesting ending.
user1: The director is Dan Scanlon, do you recognize the name?
user2: No, but I wonder if that's what he was going for all along?  A morality tale about cheating?
user2: Anyway, nice chatting you up! bye!
user1: Probably.
user1: Nice chatting with you too.  Have a good day.  Bye

conversation:
user1: Okay, let's chat about Monsters University\
user1: Have you heard of it?
user2: I have! Have you?
user1: No. It's a 3D-animated film that came out in 2013.
user1: Are you familiar with it?
user2: Is it the sequel to Monsters from Disney/Pixar?
user1: It's apparently a prequel.
user1: It's from Disney Pixar, and was the first time they made a prequel.
user2: Oh! How cool! I have only seen one trailer for it.
user1: Gotcha. There are a lot of big names on the bill...
user1: Bill Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren
user2: Is it a movie that you'd like to see?
user2: I like all of those actors.
user1: No idea. How about you? It has good ratings...
user2: I definitely would watch it.
user2: Did you see the first one?
user1: So the storyline...Mike is a 7-year-old monster to become a scarer...sounds like graduating to scare children in their rooms at night.
user1: No
user1: Sounds like he goes to school for this and doesn't do so well
user1: Music by Randy Newman, I'm in
user1: Sounds find
user1: *fun
user2: The original was fun. I bet this one is good, too. 
user1: Cinema Score is A
user1: Rotten Tomatoes is 79%
user1: I usually trust those, you?
user1: Sounds like kids would enjoy it
user2: Every great movie has challenges the characters must overcome.
user2: I generally trust the reviews and ratings.
user1: Okay, I'm getting more now...Mike has a rival named Sully who eventually becomes his good friend.
user2: Great thing about kids' movies these days, is that there's pkenty of adult humor peppered in.
user2: Yes, Mike and Sully are insepararble
user1: Mike enters the "Scare Games" to prove himself...eventually assembles a team...they gradually get better and win the competition, only to find that someone tampered with the grading mechanism. 
user1: I'd probably appreciate this movie more if I'd seen the original...
user1: But, sounds fun anyway
user2: Oh! I love a good intrigue! LOL
user2: definitely, I always recommend seeing the original first
user1: Sounds like they both get expelled and start working in the Monsters, Inc. mail room...and work their way up. I guess that's where the other film's title comes from.
user2: indeed it is
user1: So, sounds like we both want to see it
user1: Good deal
user2: Yes! I would certainly watch it.
user1: I'm almost willing to see it just because of John Goodman...I hope he has a large part
user1: I know he voiced some other Pixar films
user2: My boyfriend loves Goodman's work. I've come to appreciate him more. 

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hello.
user1: Monsters University is a good movie with a pretty good cast.
user2: Agreed.  Gets great Rotten Tomatoes ratings, too.
user1: I really like Billy Crystal and miss that I haven't seen him in much since the 90's.
user2: Yes, he's a great actor.  John Goodman is one of my favorites.  He is good in any role.
user1: I think the digital animation is pretty good as well.
user2: I really liked the music in the movie.  Good score.
user1: The story line is unique and inviting.
user1: Yeah, the music is pretty good as well.
user2: I was glad to see it stayed true to the spirit of the original Monsters, Inc.
user1: So do I, I think it's kind of cute to see them as "younger" monsters as well.  I really think younger kids can connect a little more with them that way, which is (I'm assuming) the target audience.
user2: That's a great point.  It also breaks from the tradition of doing a sequel immediately.
user2: I think adults can also relate to the struggles of fitting in, too.
user1: yeah, that is very true.  I think companies tend to rush sequels, and they end up falling flat.  This one waited and in my opinion got it right.  
user1: I certainly agree.  Fitting in is an ongoing thing with humanity.
user2: Because so many people can relate to the them and events in the movie, it gets relatively high reviews.
user1: Yeah.  I really like how you get to see the characters (especially) Mike grow and develop as the movie progresses.
user2: It's great for kids to see that just because you don't hit it off with someone immediately doesn't mean you can't eventually be friends.
user2: It's kind of a "Don't judge a book by it's cover" message.
user1: Yeah, me and my best friend met in a similar manner (not a Monster University obviously), and watching this movie kind of brought me back and reminded me how things can change.
user2: Yes, this made me think of my own experience in college as well.
user1: They really did a great job making this movie have some real life things going on in such a unrealistic world.
user2: Agreed.  My favorite message in this movie is that failure doesn't have to define you.  Mike and Sulley might have been kicked out of the university but they persist and make it with Monster's Inc.
user1: Yeah, they certainly have a good amount of lessons that I think are great for children to learn from.
user2: I appreciate how they were able to incorporate so many lessons while still keeping the movie light and funny.
user1: Right, I think they blended so many things into this movie, and did a remarkable job.
user2: The relationship between Mike and Sully is a good example of friends sticking together.
user2: Do you like animated comedies like this?
user1: Yeah, and i think it's good for people to just stick together.  I love comedies, and animated comedies are good, in that I like them and so do the kids.
user1: Have a good day :)
user2: Sometimes it's hard to find movies that appeal to such a wide audience.

conversation:
user2: HI
user1: hello. 
user2: Any movie suggestions 
user1: I'm reading about the movie. It's Monsters Univercity
user2: Interesting
user1: It's a Pixar movie so you know it's good. Billy Crystal plays one of the characters. It's also Got Steve Buscemi and Helen Mirren in it.
user2: What is about
user1: It's actually a prequel to Monster's Inc. It's the story of 2 friends, Mike and Sully and their college experiences.
user1: They slowly become best friends. 
user2: cool
user2: when was relisted 
user1: Mike is a 7 year old monster who wants to become scarier and he meets Sully as he enters the university. Sully is a much better scarer than Mike because he has a natural talent. 
user1: Mike and Sully try to join a fraternity but only Sulleu gets in. 
user1: Oh realesed in 2013
user2: does this movie have good reviews 
user1: I liked that they became friends when they were both having problems.
user1: People over all really like the movie . It had a 79% rotten tomatoes rating and a CinemaScore of A. That's pretty good 
user2: very good story about friendship and everything 
user2: Who direct it
user1: Dan Scanlon was the director.
user1: I really like the scenes around Mike entering the univerity's 'Scare Games'. He makes a bet with tHe administrator HardScrabble(Helen Mirren) that they let him back into college if he wins. 
user2: cool moment 
user1: Mike joins a group of misfits a fraternity that is not goo called Oozma Kappa, but they can't get into the scare games because they are one member short. Sully ends un joining them and they win .
user1: b
user1: But Turns out Sully cheated. 
user1: I really like Pixar movies, how about you?
user2: i will watch it for sure,i started to like this movie a lot
user1: Do you look at the ratings , like Rotten Tomatoes to decide to watch a movie or not?
user2: i think i will become real Pixar fan
user2: No,i like  the story you told mme
user1: This movie is animated, ha I may have forgotten to mention that. Also a Comedy!
user1: I think a Cinemascore of A is a really good indication of whether or not one will enjoy a move. 
user2: when you told that is like Monster Inc. i knew it that is animated so i didn't ask 
user1: I guess all of the Pixar movies are, so naturally, I assumed. 
user2: amazing colors and characters
user2: and always good story behind
user1: Yes I think its a really funny movie and obviously well acted with like top notch Hollywood actors in it. Everyone is so great. I totally forgot that Helen Mirren was in it. 
user2: Thank you for your recommendation,i will watch it  
user1: You totally should!

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: please wait. I need 5mins to read
user2: go ahead
user2: shall we start the discussion?
user2: Hello?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Did you watch Monsters University
user1: Yes, I did!
user2: Me too, I really liked it
user2: One of the best Pixar movies
user1: I'm glad you did.  I love all the voices that Billy Crystal can do!
user2: right man for the job
user1: Helen Mirren is also excellent at these movie voices
user2: Everyone did really good in this one
user2: thats what makes it special
user1: Did you take your kids to see it ?  Mine thought was adorable
user2: I dont have kids yet, but I am gonna show them the movie for sure
user1: were you confused at all that it was a prequel?
user2: Yeah I didnt know that
user1: I thought the name of the frat was hysterical "roar omega roar"
user2: It was a bit sad when they scared children
user1: I guess -- but then I really identified with Mike and Sulley
user2: they saw the problem could be solved
user2: another way
user1: Miss Hardscrabble was meant to them when she failed them for breaking her Scream Can
user1: The OOzma Kappa name was also inspired !
user2: Oozma Kappa for the win :D
user1: Mike and Sulley are well-defined characters in this film -- they are good together
user2: Yup you can really get to know them in the movie
user2: their personalities
user2: They are honest
user1: it was interesting that they only won because of the machine's weakness in being able to be tampered with
user2: that wasnt nice
user1: I know.  too bad they were expelled, though.
user2: but with hard work in the mail room
user2: they get back
user1: yes -- thank goodness -- and also that Hardscrabble seems to secretly like them
user2: they have advantage :D
user2: overall it was a really nice movie
user2: I bet its really fun for kids too
user1: I thought so as well.  It's is a nice change!

user1: i think i have see that one
user1: what are the charaters names?
user2: Mike and Sulley. It's the story of how they met.
user2: I saw "Monsters Inc." years ago, but this one is a prequel to that.
user1: oh yes . that is the one were they are in the frat. 
user1: i have not see that in a while
user2: Yes. They're in college, and they don't get along at first but (of course) they become best friends.
user1: at the scare school? right?
user2: Yeah. The college.
user1: i like the part where they were training in the library
user2: I don't know if I remember that. I remember where the Scream Can breaks, though.
user2: And yes. I remember now. The fraternity was "Roar Omega Roar", I think.
user1: was that in the class room
user2: I think so. They were taking a final.
user1: oh yea and that dean. she was scary
user2: Yup. She failed them right away for breaking that scream can.
user1: and then they had to win that contest to get back in. if i remeber correctly
user2: Yes, exactly. The "Scare Games". I'd almost forgotten about that part.
user1: oh maybe that is where the library came in. 
user2: Doesn't Sully tamper with the settings on the simulation machine?
user1: oh i think so.
user2: Yeah, it gets him expelled, I think.
user1: it has been a while since i have seen. i may have to watch it agein
user1: again
user2: Yeah, it's definitely a "feel good" movie.
user2: And it's Pixar, so you know it's good quality.
user1: i do enjoy pixar movies

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!
user2: We will be discussing the movie "Monsters University" today. Have you heard of it?
user1: I have not heard of it!Can you tell me more about it?
user2: It is a sequel to the 2001 movie Monster, Inc.
user1: I think I saw that movie when it had come out. Which studio was it done by?
user2: It tells the story of two monster Mike and Sully.
user2: Walt Disney
user2: It is a comedy.
user2: Billy Crystal plays Mike.
user1: Oh ok, I thought so but wasn't sure. I might be interested in watching it but I'm not really sure. 
user1: Who else plays in the movie?
user2: John Goodman plays Sully.
user2: It sounds pretty funny.
user2: These two monsters are studying at college.
user1: Would you say that like the first one, this is more of a children's movie? Would an adult still find it funny?
user2: It could be either I guess. 
user2: It is actually an animated film.
user1: Oh, I see. I do like animated films sometimes. Can you tell me more about the plot?
user2: The monster Mike is a 7 year old monster to wants to become a scarier monster who enters the human world at night scare children and harvest their screams for energy.
user2: I don't usually like animated movies either, but this one sounds pretty interesting.
user1: So how does Mike go about becoming scarier?
user2: He takes classes to become scarier at Monster University.
user1: And how does the other character fit in- Sully?
user2: Sully is already scary. It just comes natural to him, as he is talented that way.
user2: Although Sully does attend Monster University as well.
user2: Mike joins something called scare games at the University.
user1: What doe the scare games involve?
user2: Scare games are competing games between fraternities in the University.
user1: What happens after Mike joins?
user2: Sully joins as well. They win the game.
user1: Is that the main plot point or conflict?
user2: Yes
user1: So Sully and Mike are on the same team?
user2: Yes, Sully and Mike are on the same team. It is found out that Sully cheated somehow and caused them to win.
user2: Once it is found that Sully cheated. Mike and Sully are expelled.
user1: Why did Sully cheat if he was already so good at scaring?
user2: There is no mention of the reason why.
user1: Ok. What happens after they are expelled?
user2: They both take jobs in the mail room at Monsters Inc.
user1: Was the movie well received do you think?
user2: It has an average rating.
user1: When did the movie come out?
user2: I hope that you will consider watching this movie. I believe our time is up now. Is there anything else you would like to know. The movie came out in 2013.
user1: No that's it. Thanks so much!

conversation:
user1: good morning
user2: Good morning, have you gotten a chance to see Monster's University yet?
user1: Yes. I did and what are your thoughts on Monster University?
user2: I really liked it, ecspecially for a prequel.
user1: What do you think about the rauiting?
user1: A seems fair enough>
user2: I'm honestly surprised it's not higher but it is a fair rating
user2: I was happy to see that they kept the same actors after being so long since the first movie
user1: Ok. Are you familiar with any of these actors?
user2: Yes, I am. I have seen Billy Crystal and John Goodman in many other movies
user2: Are you?
user1: Some of them.
user2: Who was your favorite character?
user1: Michael Wazowski, a 7 year old monster, who aspires to be a scarer.
user1: And what about you?
user2: I like him but I think I like Sully more, it was fun to see them interact more with other monsters this film as well
user1: Totally agree with you on that.
user2: I thought the teacher was a bit mean though
user2: I also couldn't believe that Sully cheated, I understood why he did it but it's so out of character for him
user1: Yes, agree.
user1: This comedy was produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Love the Pixar
user2: I do as well, they take a long time to make a sequel or prequel to their other movies
user1: Indeed.
user2: 13 years for this one
user2: I was glad that the teacher made nice with them in the end
user1: Wow
user1: Yes, Definitely with you on that.
user2: It was also nice to see the others get accepted into the program even though they weren't scary, they all had a role to play
user1: Yes. Also some critics said that this animation was cute and funny.
user1: But not enough color in it.
user2: I thought it was, I hope they make another one..my kids loved it
user1: What do you think?
user1: Ok.
user2: I thought the color was okay, it wasn't something that bothered me when I watched it
user1: Me as well.
user1: Was good  enough for me.
user2: Same for me, I was kind of surprised when that was a complaint
user1: Right?!
user1: I liked this 3D computer-animated comedy.
user2: As did I, it's one of the better ones, I'm excited to see more from Pixar
user1: Yes, agree. Was good to watch it? I watched it at least  5 times
user2: I think I have watched it more than that because my child was obsessed with it for alittle while
user1: Totally understand the situation.
user1: Mine as well.
user1: Was nice talking to you

conversation:
user2: hello I like this movie as it is a prequesl to Monsters INC
user2: It really lets you see how they met and got together and started working together as friends
user1: I liked it too
user1: I love John Goodman as Sulley
user2: It remained fresh without rehashing old stuff. Yes loved John Goodman and Billy Crystal. A good pairing
user2: I see it got good reviews by rotton tomatos and cinamascore
user1: I can't believe this was the first time Pixar did a prequel
user2: Yes, you have to make a lot of money for a studio to look at a picture and think sequel let alone prequel
user1: I also can't believe Helen Mirren was in it. She's great
user2: I liked steve buscemi as well. great character actor
user2: Its good for young kids, its safe and they say easy to watch
user1: Yeah Randall is a great character
user2: Mike wazoski got the bug from the school trip to Monsters Inc and decided he was going to be a scarer
user2: Interesting how mike studies hard, but john goodmans character assumes its in the genes and slacks 
user1: I liked the dynamic of the story. Having Sulley be from a long line of scarers really made it interesting
user2: right. it was in sullys genes. big and scary
user2: and sully got into the top house on campus, along with his size look and legacy
user1: It was cool to have that play off of  Mike's longing to be a scarer
user2: poor mike always studying hard, but that does not make a good scarer
user2: interesting that they both failed, one from slacking not studying enough, and one not being scary enough
user1: The whole fraternity storyline reminded me of older comedies so I got a kick out of it
user2: making that bet with hardscrabble by saying if he scores top at the scare games to get back in the school was smart but bold
user2: and of course mike joins the weak fraternity
user1: It gave a lot of weight to the games that he would have to leave the school if he lost though
user1: It really raised the stakes
user2: I agree. Mikes training and studying came in to help the weak fraternity in the games
user2: sully really helped by cheating in the game in the final contest helping Mike
user1: Yeah, but it's too bad Sulley tampered with the machine in the last round
user2: well while they did not get what they directly wanted they still got into monsters Inc in the mail room 
user2: after they got kicked out of the school
user1: I love that they didn't win in the end, but that it ties into them starting to work for Monsters inc
user2: but hardscrabble actually respected them in the end 
user1: It was a great lead in to the first film
user2: they simply got into monsters u using a different path
user1: Yeah, they were the first students to ever surprise Hardscrabble
user2: and they ended up as friends and that slid right into the next movie
user2: I like how they had to slowly work for it
user1: It was cool that the others from their frat got into the scare program though
user2: right. a selfless act by Mike
user2: I like how the movie is safe and predictable for kids
user2: it came out in 2013...already a while ago
user2: the metacritic score is pretty high as well
user1: Yeah it was a good film and matched the first film's tone pretty well
user2: it shows that relying only on your natural abilities can lead you to falter. You have to also work at it
user1: I always kind of forget that Pixar is a part of Disney 
user1: It must be the 3D
user2: dan scanlon is also a good director...must be tough to direct an animation
user1: and yeah 2013 seems like a while ago, but can you believe the Monster's Inc came out in 2001?
user1: that's 12 years between it and the prequel. wow
user2: no i cant that was a while ago, working on 20 years!
user2: the prequel is seemless showing how they got to be the big scarer team in the first movie. Mike thinks things through, and sully provides the brawn. That is unstoppable
user1: And they started off as rivals, that was really interesting
user2: one critic said its cute and funny. Good enough for my kids
user1: yeah and it lends to the imagination
user2: I do see somewhat of a vieled insult though, this movie was safe and bland from a studio that does not often hedge its bets. But hey the movie is exactly what people wanted
user1: safe worked for this movie though. Even though it was predictable the tone worked well
user1: thanks for the conversation about this great movie
user2: sure its been real. Love this flick

conversation:
user2: Hi there, tell me do you like cartoon or CGI generated movies?
user1: I like cgi generated movies.  How about yourself
user1: ?
user2: I do, I really do like Monsters University by Dan Scanion.  It had a really good rating on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: I certainly did.  Which character did you like in the movie?
user2: My favourite character was Mike which was played by Billy Crystal in the movie.
user1: Excellent.  My favorite character was the Sulley.  He was played by John Goodman.  
user2: Brilliant, it was the prequel film to the 2001 movie Monsters, Inc and was the 14th feature film made by Pixar.
user1: It's funny how the Metacrite Score is lower than the Rotten Tomatoes percentage. Did you find it ironic?
user2: That is a bit unsual, different style of reviews I guess.  Some of the comments where great from the critiques, cute, funny, and the animation was colourful.
user1: It's definitely good movie for the kids, since according to one Critical Response, it's "safe, predictable and edge-fee".
user2: Totally, It's funny watching how Mike starts off with such aspirations to become a scarer at the beginning of the movie and then eleven years later he still has that same passion.
user1: It was a little sad when Dean Hardscrabble's fails both of them.  
user2: Yes but then they did break he cherished 'Scream Can', to be honest I think I'd probably fail them too out of spite!
user1: Well, it was an accident.  Accident happens.
user2: She doesn't feel at that point that Mike is scary enough and Sully studies enough for the role.
user2: It's exciting to watch as both Mike and Sully enter the 'Scare Game's as a chance to risk their place at the university to be reinstated by Hardscrabble
user1: Totally agree, I thought Mike showed a lot of courage making a wager with Hardscrabble to reinstate him and his team
user2: Was funny when the misfits of the university, the 'Oozma Kappa' joined their group to prevent Mike and Sully being denied entry to the games.
user1: I didn't think it was that funny, more brave, for them to join the weakest fraternity on campus.  Or desperate.  LOL 
user2: haha, maybe.  Wasn't great either when Mike found out that they only defeated Roar Omega Roar because Sully had cheated in the final scare test.
user1: yes, Mike was so disappointing.  
user1: I was worried when they got expelled
user2: I was, but then the other member of Oozma Kappa were accepted in the scare program for the next semester so not all bad.
user1: yes, it was good that Hardscrabble was impressed enough by Mike and Sulley and gave them jobs at the mail room.  
user1: I assumed she gave them the job.  
user1: Paragraph didn't say.
user2: I don't think she gave them a job at the mail room but they did accept the jobs.
user1: That's true
user2: And they did end up working their way up to join the scare team
user2: Like I said, good film with excellent reviews.
user2: CinemaScore even give them an A
user1: Agreed.  
user2: Cya!
user1: have a good day

conversation:
user2: Monster's University was released in 2013 by Pixar
user1: It is the first prequel film made by Pixar. Released 12 years after the first movie
user2: It starred Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren and Peter Sohn. 
user1: Randy Newman did the music for the film
user2: He also did the music for 6 pixar films before this one. 
user1: Pixar has made 14 feature films including this one, meaning Randy Newman has done the music for half.
user2: This is the the first prequel film made by pixar.
user1: Critics thought it captured the cuteness and fun of the original movie
user2: But they also called it safe and predictable, nearly bland.  
user1: that's true. It didn't seem to bush any boundaries
user2: Mike and Sulley become rivals at Univerisity when sulley is the only one accepted to Roar Omega Roar fraternity.
user1: Mike has to work hard but Sully comes from a privileged background and relies on his natural ability
user2: Hardscrabble fails them both after they break her Scream Can.
user1: She believes that Sulley doesn't study enough and Mike isn't scary
user2: Mike decided he wanted to be a scarer after visiting Monster Inc. on a school field trip.  
user1: The school trip was to Monsters Inc. in Monstropolis
user2: Mike enters "scare Games" and makes a wager with Hardscrabble that she has to reinstate him and his team if they win.  
user1: If his team loses he has to leave the university
user2: He joins the weakest frat on campus Ooama Kappa but they are short a team member
user1: Sulley joins them to try to get back into the scare program
user2: Oozma Kappa is last in the 1st challenge, but then they find out another team cheated and is disqualified. 
user1: Mike's training and knowledge helps them move up in the ranks until they are right behind Roar Omega Roar before the final round
user2: Mike and Sulley are expelled when it is found that sulley tampered with the machine's difficulty setting and that is why they won. 
user1: The other members of their team impressed Hardscrabble and are accepted to the scare program
user2: Mike and sulley take a job in the mail room of Monster's inc. 
user1: Hardscrabble wishes them luck and says that they surprised her
user2: They eventually work their way up to join the scarer team 
user1: Their friendship is shown when Sulley chased after Mike and cheers himup

conversation:
user2: hello!
user1: hi!
user1: Hmm Monsters University. The ratings for it seem average.
user2: Yep. But it's such a cool movie. 
user1: The cast seems really good
user2: I would have rated it higher.
user1: I like the different monster characters
user2: The voice actors are the best. I specially liked John Goodman as Sully. 
user2: Which one is your favorite?
user1: Yeah. I don't have a favorite but I didn't know Steve Buscemi is in this one
user1: Wow Mike is only 7 and he's off to college
user2: I think it might have be something like dog years, in the sense that they run different from ours.
user1: I like how Roar Omega Roar shortens to ROR haha...
user1: Ohh I see
user2: But yeah that's really crazy
user2: I think that details like that are what make it such a great movie.
user1: Yeah I love when they put fun stuff like that in movies
user1: It shows that the people who made the movies really enjoyed what they do
user2: I agree
user1: Scare Games sound fun
user1: I don't think I would be able to scare anyone haha
user2: It would be fun to go to such a school. Wouldn't it?
user2: Just learn how to scare people.
user1: Haha, Yeah meeting all these different monsters would be fun
user1: Do you like animated movies in general?
user2: Yes. 
user2: Not my favorite kind of movies, but I like them very much.
user2: How about you?
user1: I do tend to like animated movies. 
user2: Critics said that the animation in this movie was "uninspired".
user2: Do you agree?
user1: Hm I don't agree. I think that's an odd critique
user2: Right.
user2: I thought it was great.
user1: Yeah it seems fun. Thanks for talking to me about the movie.
user2: Thank you too. Bye!

conversation:
user1: so, what are your thoughts on Monster University?  Apparently it was the 14th Pixar feature film.
user1: hello?
user2: Looks like a good movie with  80 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: hello

conversation:
user1: So, basic question first: Did you like the movie?
user2: not my cup of tea but i can see that it was well done
user1: Did you see the first Monsters inc?
user2: i did but it was only on tv
user1: Did you think the college experience shown was true to real college experience?
user1: I ask because my son said it was pretty similar, lol
user2: way more beer drinking involved from what I remember.
user1: Yeah, I don't suppose they could put that in a kid's movie :)
user2: Good point well made. I guess it did show the way we make friendships along the way. Some great voice overs though.
user1: I agree. What about the frat house of misfits they ended up joining? I thought that was kind of sad and cool at the same time.
user2: Good that the movie shows kids that there is always some where that you'll fit in, even if it's not where you think you want to be to start with and that once your there it can be a great place.
user1: What did you think about when it finally hit Sulley that he couldn't coast through college/life on his name and good looks? I think that sums up a lot of people when they get out of high school and hit the 'real world".
user2: At least he realized the fact, some people seem to go through life blaming others for their own failings.
user1: Absolutely agree there.
user1: Did you feel kind of sorry for Mike? I did, because he always wanted to be a scarer but in the end he had to give up on his dream. He was terrible at his dream, but I still felt kind of bad for him.
user2: I guess, be interested to know how many kids/adults actually take away something into their real lives from these movies rather than just seeing them as entertainment.
user1: Yeah, as an adult I can see a lot of the more hidden messages but kids might not.
user1: At least, not till they get older and then they're all, "Hey, THAT'S what that meant!" :)
user1: I don't remember any of the so-called great music by Randy Newman, do you?

user2: I really liked the film, but I agree with the critics, as the movie wasn't as good as the original. 
user1: I agree, but the music by Randy Newman was classic
user2: Of course, Randy Newman always hits my nostalgia button when it comes to Pixar movies. 
user1: I'm also glad they stuck with the same characters, Mike and Sulley, although I'm not too fond of prequels
user1: Rotten Tomatoes seemed to rate this movie a little higher than I would have.
user2: I am glad too, but the voices of 50-60 year old men over 20-something characters is kinda weird when you think about it. 
user2: I agree, while it's good enough to keep the kids entertained, it is just alright. 
user1: John Goodman can be plugged into any movie really.
user2: True! He's an american icon. 
user2: I wish they did more with Steve Buscemi though. 
user1: I agree, he's hilarious. Someones gotta sacrifice the spotlight though.
user2: Fair point. If they don't introduce enough new characters, the story gets anemic.
user1: "Harvesting their screams for energy" is a pretty well imagined concept, especially appealing to children
user1: Roar Omega Roar is a great name for a monster's fraternity.
user2: I agree, and the twist where childrens laughter is better for making power than screams is cute.
user2: I did think the natural talent vs bookworm was a good choice for the conflict between sulley and mike
user1: Yes, it would be very dull if they were both excellent MU students!
user2: I wish the other Oozma Kappa characters were more memorable though. Kinda a shame. 
user2: But seriously all the frat names were pretty clever. 
user1: Yes, appealing to the adults reminiscing over their college years.
user1: I'm glad that Mike's studying showed some dividends in this scene.
user1: Yet, only to find Sulley tampered with the results :(
user2: I dunno I think that was good character building though. Like Sulley already was painfully aware of his shortcomings, but Mike thought he could study himself into being something he just cant be. It showed the value of their teamwork in the end. 
user2: You can't study your way into being a linebacker. Oh how I know that. lol
user1: Teamwork is a super underrated skill to retain while in school. You're right about the importance of it here in the movie.
user2: So many kids movies go more for the Ayn Rand-esque individualism and it's refreshing to see that. 
user2: I thought it was a good twist that they got kicked out of college. 
user1: Their friendship really held everything together, even through their expulsion.
user2: Exactly. 
user2: Good themes throughout, but sadly just left more to be desired. 
user2: But then again when you are in the shadow of Monster's Inc. it is hard to stand out. 
user1: Some movies need to be left alone, hollywood likes to be clingy.
user2: Hollywood just likes to make money. lol
user1: At least it was spread 12 years to appeal to a different generation and not some prequel that was released only 1-2 years later.
user2: Good point.
