wiki document:
cast:
Keanu Reeves as Jonathan "John" Wick, an ex-hitman who returns to the criminal underworld following the death of his wife and a run-in with a Russian Crime Syndicate.
Michael Nyqvist as Viggo, the head of the Tarasov family and an enterprising businessman with questionable roots.
Alfie Allen as Iosef, the arrogant, entitled and foolish son of Viggo.
Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins, a distinguished female contract killer in the underworld of assassins, and a former acquaintance of John.

critical response:
John Wick is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of
Action movies are about movement, and John Wick pursues that goal with remorseless verve.
After a marked absence from the genre, Reeves resoundingly returns with an effortless, kinetic style that positions the film extremely well for any potential follow-ups.
Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style   and even some wit   that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic.
Reeves's semi-deliberate zonked deadpan style only really works in juxtaposition with funny dialogue   and this is a pretty humourless and violent film, which grinds on and on with more and more gleaming black SUVs getting trashed.

Chad Stahelski

description:
Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop run by Aurelio to have the VIN changed. Aurelio recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches him before throwing him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who tells him Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York City. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's actions, beats and berates Iosef, explaining to him that John Wick was his best assassin, nicknamed 'Baba Yaga.' When John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an 'impossible task', implied to involve multiple assassinations. John succeeded, establishing the Tarasov syndicate. 
John learns from Winston, the Continental's owner, that Viggo has Iosef protected at his nightclub, the Red Circle. John enters the Red Circle and kills his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape. John retreats to the Continental to tend his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. He forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's front, knocks her unconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin Harry to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry.  John travels to the Little Russia church which serves as Viggo's front and destroys Viggo's cache of money and blackmail material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but he is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking he could leave his old life behind. Before John can be killed, Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself, kill Kirill, and accost Viggo. Under John's gunpoint, Viggo reveals Iosef's location to him. John then travels to Iosef's 'safe house' and kills him. 
Perkins sees that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus tortured before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. Perkins, however, is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for breaking the Continental's rules.  Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter, and John races to the harbor, killing Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a fistfight on the dock. Viggo pulls a knife and John allows himself to be stabbed, surprising Viggo. John then disarms and fatally wounds Viggo. Wounded himself, John stops at a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and takes with him a pit bull puppy which was scheduled to be euthanized. John and the dog walk home on the boardwalk where he had his last date with Helen.

user2: Hi! We'll be discussing the movie John Wick!
user1: Hello, sounds great
user1: What can I expect from John Wick
user1: I've heard really good things but dog killing can be a a bit of a downer
user2:  Firstly, it received great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes! And it's about a former human who returns to the criminal underworld to extract revenge following the death of his wife!
user2: Are you a fan of Keanu Reeves?
user1: I am a great fan of him and his work, I don't think he's avenging his wife though
user1: from what I understand she dies of natural causes and leaves him a puppy so he has a reason to go on, but then some people break into his home and kill the dog
user2: Critics certainly praised his performance in this film.
user1: well critical praise is definitely a reason to check out a performance as is a good overall rt score
user2: True. It all tales place following the death of his wife after a run in with a Russian crime syndicate. 
user1: what kind of action movie is it
user2: Very true! It also received a Cinemascore of B as well!
user1: is it like the marvel movies heavy on the comedy or more like classic action movies 
user2: Its sort of an American neo-noir action flick. One critic described it as  "fired up, ferocious B movie fun we can't get enough of".

conversation:
user1: Hi there, this is like one of my favorite movies
user1: It was really hard to see the puppy get killed, it evoked so many emotions of sadness and anger!
user2: Hi! Do you like it? I loved How Keanu Reeves acts
user1: yes , he is awesome in it!
user1: I like how the clean up crew comes in too....they are comical! lol
user2: haha, yes, there were so many action scenes for they to clean after
user1: doesnt like a cop how up too thats a friend? 
user1: I find it hard to believe rotten tomatos ratings also! it should be like at least a 8 or 9!
user2: I think you are refering to Alfie Allen performance. That was not shi top notch
user2: Even CinemaScore, that usually is more reliable, only gave it a B
user2: BTW, I can't believe in was released 4 years ago
user2: I mean, the movie is still fresh and with so much style for a crafty revenge thriller
user1: the cop knocked on the door after a scene and he opens the door and the cop is like "is everything ok" lol and he is like yeah. it was comical. 
user1: John wick 2 was actually terrible, nothing as good as the first one 
user1: I also like the bellman at the hotel.  played by Lance Reddick
user1: the ending is really good to when he gets another dog!
user2: Andd you wouldnt want to get in the bad side of Ms Perkins, played by Adrianne Palicky
user1: oh right, she plays a good character 
user2: Oh!, I liked also the Mustang that starts the second scene
user2: Also, highly recognizable, that's a plothole in my opinion
user1: yeah so many nice cars, reminds me of fast and furious
user1: that is a good scene they are refering to, when Aurelio tells him something like john wick is the boogeyman or something lol
user2: I liked that , by the way of the Mustang stealing, it gets establshed the previous story of Jhon Wick as a top assassin.
user1: yeah it would be nice if they came out with a pre sequel, is that a prelude? like showing him in his past days and his wife

conversation:
user1: John Wick is a good action movie, do you agree?
user2: hey there\
user2: yes i am agree
user2: i love action movies
user1: Me too.
user1: There were some Russian mobsters in the movie.
user1: He came out of retirement when his wife got killed.
user2: yes 
user1: The critics gave it a 86% score.  That's pretty good for an action movie.
user1: That was rotten tomatoes.  Metacritic gave it a 68/100
user2: yeah i saw that
user2: i watched movies with better score
user1: It said his wife died but gave him the puppy.  So his vengeance was for the theft of his car and the death of his puppy.
user2: yeah but it was not a logical story
user2: nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed
user2: do you watch the climax
user1: It is what they call neo-noir.  I guess that means it is not supposed to make sense because it is an altered reality.
user1: Yes I watched the whole movie.
user2: i watched some scenes
user1: The idea was that he was a hit man who retired so he could hand out with his wife.
user2: but now whole movie
user2: oh that's nice
user1: Sorry hang out.
user2: a retired hit man
user1: So his wife got the puppy and then she died of natural causes or disease or something.
user2: so that's movie with lots of action
user2: oh that's too bad
user2: so he find he whoever did that
user1: She got him the puppy, then after she died they killed his puppy and stole his car.
user1: Yes  that's what the movie is about.  The Russian mobster's son did it.
user2: so what will happen in climax?
user1: So he just went to kill that guy and in order to do it he had to go through a lot of Russian mobsters.
user1: Let me check if they have that info.
user2: sorry i didn't watch the whole film
user1: At the end he was able to go to Iosef's safe house and kill him.
user2: oh interesting

user2: Yeah! I loved it
user2: I felt crushed when they killed his puppy though
user1: IKR! Very violent film, destroyed a lot of stuff - how many black SUV's were trashed during the filming of this movie? 
user2: HAHAHA! oh my god. SO TRUE! the infamous black SUV
user1: I had totally forgotten that John Leuizamo was in this movie, he is like the ninja actor that shows up when you least expect it! 
user2: Oh yeah! That's right. So many great actors in this movie
user2: And they all looked so cool in their mafia suits
user1: The movie has such an authentic criminal world feel to it. (cough cough) not that I would know what the criminal underworld looks like 
user2: hahaha uh oh
user2: oh and the Mustang was SICK!
user1: The scene where the bad guy realizes that they just pissed off wick - priceless
user1: I looooove mustangs

user2: hahah you know it!
user2: it was a really fun movie

user2: I would do the same for my dog in a heartbeat!
user1: extremely rare gem of a film 
user1: Who was that lady assassain in the nightclub? Extremely beautiful  
user2: Yeah, I'm surprised it only received a B rating on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: kept rewinding her scenes! Great actress 
user2: Ms. Perkins?
user1: You know, sometimes the critics get it right and other times we just gotta judge for ourselves! 
user1: That's her! 
user2: Yeah I never really trust ratings. We all have different tastes. It's all subjective
user2: That's Adrianne Palicki
user1: Yes! I know her from other stuff, but she was too good in this movie. A great actress always makes you forget your watching a movie! 
user2: yeah she was a great character!
user1: Up uuuuuuntil she died. She broke the rules.....and rules are rules...lol
user1: That last fistfight though! 
user1: What do you think, better than Neo vs Agent smith? 
user1: Wick went through the henchmen, and I was shocked when wick allowed himself to get stabbed! I literally said aloud "What are you doing?" 
user1: Then I said "Oh, I see now!" lol 
user1: I liked the final fight scene in Wick better than the matrix Just my opinion. 
user1: and of course, at the end, wick gets a new puppy
user1: what happens if the mailman accidentally maces' wicks' new dog? lol
user2: haha sorry my internet got glitchy for second
user2: but yeah! haha pretty funny

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hi, have you seen the John Wick movies?
user1: I have seen the first one but I have not seen the second one.
user2: The next one is great where he goes after his car that was stolen.
user1: That sounds interesting.  I will make plans to the see the 2nd John Wick movie.  What was the topic of the movie that you read about?
user2: He was seeking revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his puppy.
user1: What person was he seeking revenge against?
user2: Losef the son of the head of the Tarasov syndicate, took the Mustang to Aurello's shop to get the VIN number changed and Aurello kicks him out of the shop and tells John.
user1: How did John go about getting his revenge?
user2: John wanted to retire but was drawn back in to get revenge.
user1: Does John get any help getting his revenge?
user2: John visited Aurello who tells him Losef  is the son of  Viggo.
user1: Who is Viggo?
user2:  John learns that Losef is at the Night club from Winston of the Continental, he prepares to get Losef. He is the son of Viggo who is the head of the Russian syndicate in New York.
user1: Why doesn't Viggo just give Losef to John?
user2: John travels to little Russia where Viggo has a church front. He destroys the cache of money and blackmail making material,
user2: Losef is his son and does not want Jon to kill him.
user1: Why doesn't Viggo just pay for John's new car and buy him a new dog to save his son?
user2: They tried to kill John so he was after the whole sindicate and raced to the Helicopter that Viggo was trying to escape in.
user2: I think this is the one you saw.
user1: I don't remember much of the plot from the first movie.  I do remember John Wick killing everyone in bullet filled ballet.
user2: I loved the end where he takes out Viggo being stabbed. He then goes to a Veterinarian and treats his self and takes a pit bull puppy scheduled to be euthanized. 
user1: I do remember that part.  I enjoyed the ending of the movie.
user2: The part where he walks home along the boardwalk with the puppy and rembers that is where he had his last date with Helen.
user1: Who is Helen?
user2: She was his wife that died.
user1: How did she die?

conversation:
user1: John returns to the criminal underworld
user1: I wonder if that was triggered by the death of his wife.
user2: thats interesting
user2: The movie sounds exciting
user1: Yes very interesting
user2: Are you a fan of Keanu Reeves?
user1: It's an action thriller movie. I love action thrillers.
user2: Me too. I also like mystery and adventure movies.
user2: When do you plan on seeing the movie? or have you seen it already?
user1: This movie deserves a follow up
user2: I agree
user1: revenge thrillers are intense
user2: Yes they are.
user1: It only only got 6.9/10 hmmm
user2: Wow. Im surpried.
user1: Made in 2014. Kind of old
user2: Oh ok. Good to know.
user1: I would have thought it was newer
user2: I remember when the trailer came out.
user2: It had a lot of hype around it.
user1: Who returns to crime after the death of a loved one hmmm
user2: No one in their right mind.
user1: oh I should have know seeking vengence
user2: Yeah. Revenge would be a good reason for some people.
user1: They stole his car and killed his puppy, a gift from the dead wife.
user2: Wow. Thats bad.
user1: I hate torture in movies though
user2: Yeah. Its very unpleasent.
user1: I like action though like fighting

user1: I feel like they dont make movies like that anymore, like action movies

user1: Yeah exactly 
user2: It was nice to see John Leguizamo make a little bit of a comeback.
user1: I dont remember seeing him in the first one
user2: I would have had the same reaction as Wick to anyone who killed the puppy my dead wife gave to me.
user1: yeah your right I would have gone insane.

user1: There seems to be a lot of history between them.
user2: Oh i doont know
user1: It was good talking to you! I've got to go now!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey
user1: I really loved Keanu in this part, what about you?
user2: Yes, he played the part well in my opinion.
user2: I like that it had a lot of action.
user1: Do you normally like Action movies?
user2: Yes, do you?
user2: What did you think about the storyline?
user1: I do, they keep my attention really well. I loved how you didnt know what he was going to do next. 
user2: Yeah, the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
user1: I feel like the critics just use big words, do you think they were right about their opinons?
user2: I usually go by Rotten Tomatoes when looking for reviews.  I think they could of gone a little higher with the review.
user1: Do you think John's boss should have left him go?
user2: Yes, but it wouldn't of been as good, I think.
user2: Do you like the director Chad Stahelski?
user1: I never pay attention to director names honestly, so I cant name any other movies directed by him.
user2: Same here, I never heard of him before. 
user2: I think the names of the characters fit the part.
user1: I also like his name, its quick to say and catchy. I love that the guy was mean to his son because he knew what he did and knew he was in trouble.
user2: I liked that he got punched and throws him out when he finds out who the car was stolen from John.
user1: I love that his revenge is based on principal and not on just money or drugs, he is doing it for a reason close to himself.
user2: Yes, I agree that is what makes it so good.  
user1: I love how none of the other assassins can get him, like why are yall trying, he is the best for a reason! 
user2: I love how he destroyed Viggo's money before he is captured.
user1: Yeah that really showed him who was boss didnt it?
user1: I love how John let Viggo get the upper hand, but it was just a trick so he could murder him.
user2: Yes, and the fist fight at the dock was intense.   Then he was stabbed.
user2: It is great and wonderful turnaround.
user1: It really kinda of made you see how smart the character was and how dedicated he was to his cause.
user2: I loved how he saved the puppy from death at the end.
user1: It was a great segway for sure.
user1: I love when movies have solid endings like this one did.
user2: I wonder if being a pit bull puppy had any significance.

conversation:
user1: I agree do you like action movies?
user2: I like some action movies, yes.  Do you?
user1: yea I enjoy most
user1: John Wick is really good

user2: Are you still there?
user2: Hello?

conversation:
user1: This is "John Wick" 2014 with Keanu Reeves. I saw this and thought it was ok.
user2: OK

conversation:
user2: The movie is about an ex-hitman looking for revenge.
user1: that covers a lot of movies. what's it called?
user2: The movie is called John Wick, the main actor is Keanu Reeves.
user1: oh, right. that was a good one. its sequel was pretty good too. there should be a third installment soon 
user2: I would watch it just for the fact he is getting revenge on the people who killed his dog!
user1: yep. and trashed his car too. beautiful mustang. it goes over more of the background in the sequel. why he left the hitman job etc 
user2: I thought the action scenes were well shot in the first movie. how about you?
user1: action scenes in john wick is legendary. espeically the scene where wick kills the home invaders. all shot in one take 
user2: rotten tomatoes gave it a 6.9 out of 10. Think it deserves a bit better?
user1: rotten tomatoes ratings are not that reliable. i prefer imdb myself. 
user1: aren't we supposed to change to a new movie after 3-5 turns? 
user2: nope, just more about the Wick!
user1: i see. well i don't have a text on my end. so i guess you're supposed to take the lead. anyway the first one was kinda confusing because they skip the background story
user2: Baba Yaga is such a weird nickname for Wick. Do you know what it means?
user1: no. i didn't even realize that was a nick name for wick... 
user2: Does it kind of remind you of those old school B-movies?
user1: the first one, not so much. but the action scenes are kinda over the top but that was the point i think 
user2: The scene when he goes on a killing spree at the Red Circle nightclub is a prime example of over the top
user1: i don't remember that scene...
user2: do you remember the scene when he destroys Viggos money?
user1: oh. right. 
user2: I would have took the money and bought a new dog instead of destroying it
user1: it's a poetic justice. you killed what means a lot to me i'm goign to destroy what means a lot to you type of thing
user2: The fight scene on the dock was crazy when Wick got stabbed, like he allowed it to happen.
user1: don't remember much about the individual scenes.. he gets stabbed ? 
user2: yeah right before killing dude at the end.
user1: huh. probably a device to draw in the viewers. we like seeing our heroes overcome grave situation. 
user2: bitter sweet ending when he walks away with a new dog after getting all stabbed up.
user1: yeah. the sequel picks up after that scene basically.

user2: I know its just a character presence but I have to believe that some of that is real!
user2: Scary! 
user1: I agree. He gives me the creep factor.
user2: What do you think about the ratings on this movie? 
user1: Is 86% good?
user2: Is this something that you would watch?
user1: I don't know. 6.9 average, so I'm not entirely sure
user1: Surely there has to be a little bit of comedy, right?
user2: Honestly I don't usually check ratings. I just go for it if the trailer looks decent and I recognize a character or two.
user1: I'm the same way. 
user2: I would think so. People want to laugh at some point especially when things get to serious
user1: I agree. If the trailer looks good, I might see it, otherwise, nope.
user2: Keanu has been so serious lately hasn't  he?
user1: yeah. probably trying to shake off The Matrix stereotype or whatever it's called.
user2: LOL, thats true
user1: But I know in real life he's a decent guy. Would love to see him back with Sandra Bullock in another movie
user2: ''Semi deliberate zonked deadpan style''. That has to include a leather jacket
user2: I KNOW! how great were they together
user1: Hahahah for real!
user2: I don't know much about him really, except that he likes to take the subway
user1: Is that a joke I should be aware of? LOL
user2: Nope. serious business. 
user2: Well it was a pleasure.

conversation:
user1: I am so glad to see Keanu Reeves back! It's been so long since I've seen a movie with him.
user2: Hey it's the John Wick movie
user2: Keanu is a badass actor i agree
user2: I have not seen this, but I think I might want to now. Rotten tomatoes has it at 86%. I use that web site 
user1: It has pretty good reviews too. I'm not usually  big fan of action films, but this one sounds good.
user2: 2014 wow I thought it was more recent.
user1: Me too! I don't keep up with the latest movies. So it looks like he is trying to get revenge for his wife's death.
user2: Never heard of the director Chad Stahleski
user2: theft of car, death of puppy and wife is the motive 
user1: I don't think I have either. 
user1: Yeah, the puppy part is really sad. 
user2: out of the other actors I have heard of Leguizamo and williem dafoe
user1: I haven't even heard of them. 
user1: I have always loved Reeve's style. 
user2: I think I've read that he was born in South Africa
user2: Wow Russian mob scene :)
user1: I knew he wasn't born in the US. 
user2: Baba Yaga sounds like an assasin's name :) hahaha
user1: This movie is supposed to be pretty violent I think.
user1: So they used a little Russian church as a front lol.
user2: Sounds pretty violent, but violence sells
user2: New york city is the setting huh
user1: That seems pretty fitting. 
user1: I don't care for violent movies, especially when it involves violence towards women too.
user2: I thought it was a sci fi movie
user2: wow a big showdown with the big Russian mob boss is the final scene.
user2: my mother is also a big critic of violence in movies and tv
user1: No, it's an action movie. 
user1: But like you said, it's what sells.
user2: No female counterpart for Keanu in this movie
user1: That's disappointing. 
user1: But I guess since his wife died recently, it would not be good for the script. 
user2: Maybe in the second part. John Wick 2 which came out recently I think
user1: Oh, yeah I think I've seen the previews for that. 

conversation:
user2: Hello 
user1: Hey. I love action movies. 
user2: Me Too! I was really impressed by that John Wick film starring Keanu Reeves that came out in 2014. Did you get a chance to see it? If so, how did you feel about it? 
user1: Yea Ive seen it recently. I thought it was really good. Had enough action in it to keep me entertained
user1: Did you like it?
user2: Yes I definitely did. I really liked the supporting cast. I thought Alfie Allen gave a really strong performance with their role. I always love plots that involve hitman
user2: I thought some of the reviews were a little tough on the film though. Did you agree with the critics?
user1: The plot itself for me with his wife being killed and him wanting revenge seemed kind of stale but it still played out pretty well in the movie. I thought some of the reviews made pretty good sense but yea others not so much 
user2: Yes, I think the plot was pretty well laid out. I think it was difficult for both directors to have as much creative input as they wanted, I wonder why only one of them were actually credited on the film though?
user1: Yea thats a good question. Probably something political
user2: True! I really like how much backstory the movie gave on the characters. It was really cool to learn about John Wicks involvement with the Russian crime syndicate. 
user1: Yea that was cool. And I love that they picked Russia. Perfect for a hitman type movie
user2: Definitely. I could see this movie having a sequel or a spin-off film of some type too. The ending left it open for follow-ups. 
user1: There actually is a sequel out 
user2: Oh wow. I had no idea. I definitely need to check that out then. Do you know when it came out? 
user1: I dont remmber exactly but it wasnt too long ago
user2: Okay cool. I also really liked the setting of most of this film. The scene where John went to Little Russia was so cultural to me. 
user1: I liked that they also included a hitwoman in the movie as well
user2: For sure. I really like how committed these two directors were towards character development. I think the Hitman film idea has been done numerous times in movies  but the dialogue and costume design of this film really made it stand out from the others. 
user1: Yea this easily could have been another boring hitman movie but they did a very good job with it 
user2: Definitely. I am always a fan of violence in action movies, but the slight moments of humor definitely stuck with me after watching the film. 
user1: And the slight humor fits Keanu Reeves strengths along with the action
user2: That's for sure. I really enjoyed how they closed out the last scene too. The confrontation with Viggo was what I had been waiting on all film. Still don't know why he let himself get stabbed but the fight was pretty intense. 
user1: Yes that scene did not dissapoint 
user2: I definitely thought the ending was a little cheesy though. Saving the injured puppy was a little dramatic. 
user1: I didnt like how they killed the dog in the begining 
user2: Yeah it was definitely unnecessary. I guess the writers felt like they needed to bring everything full circle. Seems like they could of done without both scenes entirely in my opinion. 
user1: Yea it deffinitely did not seem essential to the rest of the plot 
user2: That's for sure. Thanks for talking to me about this. 

conversation:
user1: this was a good movie
user2: It was.
user2: I liked the action sequences.
user1: yea the action was the best part
user1: also keanu reeves is bad ass
user2: He is. I love any movie he does.
user1: although i think the premise of the movie is a little bit dry
user2: Yes. It was.
user2: Did you see the sequel?
user1: no i havent
user1: i thought about it but it didnt look good
user2: It wasn't as good.
user1: i figured
user1: what do u think about the key scene?

conversation:
user1: What movie did you watch?
user2: So the film I saw is John Wick, which came out in 2014. It's an action film starring Keanu Reeves, who comes out of retirement as a hitman because his car was stolen and his puppy was killed. It has a pretty good critical reception too.
user1: Why did the critics particularly like it?
user2: One critic liked the "B-movie fun" of the film, another liked that Reeves returned to the action/thriller genre, and another really liked the movment of the film.
user2: It has an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a pretty great score overall
user1: That is a pretty good score! Does "B-movie fun" mean that the film is shallow but has a lot of engaging action?
user2: I think the critic means that the film's plot isn't overly complicated, since it's a pretty easy to follow revenge story, but it has a lot of action and interesting fight scenes, which I also agree with.
user1: So the revenge plot is initiated when someone kills Reeves' dog?
user2: Partly. His character is retired and his vintage car is stolen and his puppy is killed. The puppy was a gift from his wife who had recently died, which is why he's so upset about this and is seeking vengeance.
user2: I find the use of the puppy very interesting, as it definitely gets the audience on his side and makes you root for him, even though he's a hitman and generally isn't a character that should be "rooted for."
user1: Oh ok.  I like dogs, but that seems like a more appropriate revenge plot.  Were the people who stole his car just a random group of robbers?  Or were they something more organized?
user2: The main guy that stole his car is the son of a guy named Viggo, who's the head of a crime family.
user1: Did Reeves do something in particular to this family, or to Viggo in particular, to cause them to target him for robbery?
user2: No, he didn't. There's actually a really great scene where the son takes the car into a shop and the guy recognizes the car as being John Wick's and calls his father. When his father finds out that he stole his car and killed his puppy, he's really upset at his son.
user2: John Wick was retired, but he has a serious reputation and is known as the "Baba Yaga." It's really interesting because you only learn bits and pieces of John Wick's history, which makes the film have this deep mythos that you don't have all the answers about. I really liked that aspect of the film.
user1: Was there anything special to the action scenes?  Were they shot or choreographed in a particularly interesting way?  
user2: You should definitely look up some of the scenes online, they're incredible! John Wick's legend is initially built up through his reputation and the fear other criminals, like Viggo, have of him, so that when you do finally see him fight later on, it's much more satisfying.
user1: But is there anything particularly interesting about how the director staged or filmed the fight scenes?
user2: There are a lot of fight scenes that are back to back too, which makes the film feel really fast-paced. Like there's a scene where John fights his way to the guy that stole his care who's in a nightclub and escapes, and shortly after, John is back in his hotel room and has to fight off an assassination attempt.
user1: Anything cinematically compelling outside of the plot?
user2: It's also really thematically interesting too, exploring ideas of mortality, revenge, etc., all while building up the mythos of John and the people around him.
user2: It's difficult to describe the fight scenes in the film, which is why I'm dancing around it a bit. It's something you should definitely see for yourself. It's definitely something that critics talk a lot about in their reviews, about the fight choreography and the movement and relentlessness of the fight scenes.
user1: I see.  How long is the movie?
user1: I ask because if it is a tight hour-and-a-half, it sounds like it could be fun.  But if it is a three hour slog, I'm not sure I need that much revenge.
user2: Oh gosh, I can't remember the film's run time. It definitely doesn't feel that long, with all the action scenes in it.
user2: Haha, completely get you there! I don't remember it being a 3 hour film. It's definitely pretty tight.

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: hi
user2: did you like the movie
user1: I like the action sequences but the plot was weird.  How did you like the movie?
user2: It was a very slick action movie. Some of the dialogue was lacking spark. I don't buy the whole plot point about the dog.
user1: I think the dog was just used for sentimental reasons.  The action sequences were excellent.
user2: Yes, the action sequences were very well produced.
user1: The movie could have been so much better with a better plot and a little bit more humor.
user2: I agree
user2: I agree with the first critic that this film really ups the game for B movies.
user1: I also think that Keanu Reeves does not show enough emotions (angry, sadness, grief) in the movie.  His performance is a bit bland and stoic.
user2: I think this movie is excessively violent, but I guess that's what happens when it is a story about an assassin.
user1: I agree the movie is very violent.  The movie seems to be desperating trying hard to give a reason for John Wick to kill everybody.
user2: my thoughts exactly. It also glorifies guns and violence.
user1: Yes.  I sort had to turn off my brain and try to enjoy the movie.  Why couldn't they just bought John a new dog and give back his car?
user2: Right! But then we wouldn't have a movie.
user1: I guess this movie is more focused on violent entertainment; violence for the sake of violence.
user2: It's also kind of lazy of the writers that they're using the russian mob as the antagonists.
user1: I know some russians in real life.  I would not want to mess with them.  They have told me some pretty crazy stories about living in Russia.
user2: That's what I hear. I'm not saying they are a bad choice to be in the movie, I just think it
user2: has been done too often
user1: Yeah; I sure with John's background as an assassin the writers could have come up with a better and more interesting villain.
user2: I agree. Maybe someone from his past or from his family. Even an old coworker would be more interesting than "The Russian Mob"
user1: Marcus could have been used a friend/enemy for John, which would have been very interesting. 
user2: That's a good idea. They could do away with the silly dog plot and use that.
user1: Yeah the movie has a lot of potential (regarding the code of the assassin and the Continental hotel) but failed to live up to it.
user2: It's interesting that they had John go to a vet clinic to get stitched up. I've seen that a lot more lately, ever since breaking bad did it.
user1: A lot of ideas in Hollywood are recycled.
user2: I agree. this movie is one big recycled idea. At least it's well made.
user1: Yeah, it is obvious that spend a lot of time and attention to detail regard the action sequences.
user2: Right, it doesn't take a lot of risks, other than the action stuff. It checks all the boxes on the list of what makes a film an action movie. I can't fault them for trying to make a well made action movie. It doesn't apologize.
user1: Yeah, I viewer is simply forced to acception the movie for what it is not what it could be; such is life.

conversation:
user1: Hello! I'm interested in learning about the movie you read about?
user2: Hey User 2, have you seen the movie John Wick? 
user1: No I haven't, what type of movie is it?
user2: It is an Action movie, do you like action movies?
user1: Some of them can be pretty good! What actors are in it?
user2: Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyvqist, Alfie Allen. They are less known than Keanu Reeves.
user1: I see! Is Reeves the main character?
user2: Yes he is, can I tell you about the movie?
user1: Sure, what's it about?
user2: So Keanu Reeves plays John Wick. He is a retired assassin whose wife had just passed away. Her dying gift to him was a small puppy. One day Wick goes to the gas station in his hot rod mustang and these guys approach him to buy his car. He denies them which they get pretty upset. Long story short they come to his house at night and steal his car and kill the dog in front of him. The rest is about vengeance on the people who happen to be related to the mob. The fighting styles and shooting techniques are all very realistic. 
user2: They made a second one which is just as good. 
user1: Wow, that sounds pretty intense! Do you know what year this one was made?
user2: Yeah it’s a really good movie. The first one came out in 2014.
user2: John Wick 2 came out last year I believe 
user1: Nice, I'm surprised I never heard of it. Do you know how the critics liked it?
user2: Rotten tomatoes gave it an 86%. Do you want to hear some stats from other critics?
user1: Interesting, Rotten tomatoes is one of my go to for getting reviews. And yes, what are some of the other critics saying?

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi!
user2: do u love action movies such as this?
user2: I have seen it in real life . Have u?
user1: Yeah I love them!  And no I haven't seen it :(  
user1: what do you think of the cast
user2: super chilled out. Keanu reeves is a timeless classic actor
user1: Yeah I have really like his recent stuff
user1: and the director?
user2: I first saw his work in Matrix and John Wick made him still look like that same badass actor he is 
user2: I dont really know the director but trust me..this is worth going to find 
user2: u'll love it
user1: Yeah he's one of those actors that people either love or hate.  
user2: I agree
user1: I love his stuff personally so I'll definitely have to watch this
user1: He doesn't show much emotion lol
user1: but it fits his characters so well
user2: hahaha..u really know him 
user2: his dog was killed and hs car stolen 
user2: in d movie
user2: the whole fight was over a car and a dog can u imagine?
user1: woah wait... A dog being killed!?  Idk if I can watch this lol
user2: but it was well played out masterfully though
user1: for some reasons humans dying in movies is okay to watch but i have a serious soft spot for dogs
user2: oh u u will...they didnt show the dog being shot at directly..u know these movie directors
user2: they always want to watch out for everyone's interest
user1: Yeah but like, is there audio of it crying or yelping?  I feel so sad when they do that lol
user1: Even though I know it's not real lol
user1: Is this a movie series?
user2: John wick have been out of business for so long...he is the best assasin in town ..and all of a sudden the mafia's young son want no other car in the whole town..only john wicks
user2: its not a series
user1: Oh well that's unfortunate for them... but fortunate for us I suppose lol
user2: he was warned by everyone that its a no go area even by his father but he wouldnt listen
user1: Got cocky and ended up facing off with John Wick lol
user1: Bad move
user2: he still steals the car and kills the dog and john does not have a wife..
user2: yea
user2: kind of
user1: Bye! :)

conversation:
user1: I can't believe John Wick has an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. It seems like it should be lower. What do you think?
user2: I agree, the movie doesn't seem to have much substance.
user1: True. I'm personally not a Keanu Reaves fan. I'm not really a fan of Adrianne Palicki either. How about you?

conversation:
user2: Hello there!
user1: Hey how's it going?
user1: Alright so do the movies you tend to watch be filled with action?
user2: Some, yes.
user1: Well I have one gem of an action flick for you now. Enter "John Wick," the classic 2014 action thriller. It stars Keeanu Reeves
user2: Oh. Sounds interesting. What's it about?
user1: So basically John Wick is a retired hitman and his vintage car (which was a gift from his recently deceased wife) was stolen and his puppy was killed so obviously he is out for revenge on the perpetrator
user2: Cool! Sounds like one of those "on the edge of your seat" type of movies. Are there any more actors or actresses in the movie that I would know?
user1: Well I think there's a bunch of B-list actors like Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, so if you're into that then yeah there's quite a few. Keanu is obviously the most well know. Basically you go for John Wick
user2: Gotcha. So, does the movie plot take place in the US? Or elsewhere?
user1: Yeah so it'll take place in New York since the main "baddie" in the story revolves around the Russian crime syndicate in NYC
user2: Nice. Well, definitely sounds like a movie I would be interested in seeing! 
user1: If and when you watch the movie look out for some crazy, "knock your socks off" action sequences with a decent amount of humor thrown in
user2: Perfect! Sounds like my kind of movie!
user1: If you're a follower of rottentomatoes, it received a decent critic score of 86%
user2: Wow, that's a high score! It must be a great movie. Can't wait to see it
user2: How do we finish the conversation?
user1: I think we have to have 12 responses each haha so I guess I'll go on
user1: So also there's a moment of the film where we learn about the previous assassinations that John made which is sure to turn heads
user1: If you're a fan of Chad Staheleski films then this one will be good for you as well
user2: Oh, I love Chad Staheleski. 
user2: Does he play a main role?
user1: Haha I bet. If you're talking about Chad, I don't think so but the acting is so good from the previously mentioned actors that I don't think you'll be missing too much
user2: Oh, well. Thats ok. Still sounds amazing. Do you know how long the movie lasts?
user1: There's a part of the movie where John basically kills his way into a night club where a person he is looking for (Viggo) is held
user1: I don't actually know that, other than the fact that the action seemed to go on for appropriate lengths
user2: I love me some good action! 
user2: So, is the movie just straight up action packed? Is there any comedy in it? Romance?
user1: I believe it is entirely action with some comedy thrown in 
user1: But if you like that you should check it out!
user2: I definitely will! Sounds great!
user1: I think we are good to go now (the finish conversation button popped up for me in the bottom right)
user1: Take care

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello, how are you?
user1: What movie have you been assigned to read about?
user1: Are you there?

conversation:
user1: Hi! Have you seen the movie "John Wick?" I wanted to talk with you about it!
user2: I have seen the movie
user1: I think it was really good! Keanu Reeves definitely did a great job acting in it.
user2: I agree, the role definitely suited him.
user1: It made me sad when they killed his dog, though. 
user2: I hated seeing the little beagle die, it was almost too much.
user1: I am surprised that the movie only got a "B" score. I would watch it again. Would you?
user2: I totally would, in fact, I bought the Blu-Ray
user1: Do you like action movies like this one?
user2: I absolutely do. This is my favorite genre of film.
user2: What about you?
user1: I had forgotten how John Wick's nickname was "Baba Yaga." Do you know what that means?
user1: I also am a big action film fan!
user2: If I remember correctly, it meant something like the boogeyman, right?
user1: I think you are right! Remember when the father figured out his son had stolen Wick's car and killed his dog? His facial expression of terror and anger were well-acted.
user2: oh yeah, he knew that things were about to get real
user1: That nightclub at the end of the movie was pretty cool! 
user1: "the Red Circle"
user2: Yep, it was really cool, and John Wick tore it to pieces. That made it even cooler
user1: I agree! What did you think about the hotel that Wick stayed at, and how Ms. Perkins tried to sneak in and kill him?
user2: I kind of saw that coming, but it was still an interesting part of the movie. She got hers in the end.
user1: I thought the method of payment (i.e., those gold coins) was interesting. 
user2: Yeah, it showed these people as being part of a secret society
user1: What did you think about the ending of the movie where John takes the puppy that was supposed to be euthanized and goes to the boardwalk?
user2: I think it was a good ending, the puppy was very similar in circumstances to himself
user2: Plus I have a soft spot for bully breeds. :)
user1: I agree! I love dogs. What do you think about the actor who played Viggo?
user2: He was a great actor, it is unfortunate that he recently passed away in real life.
user1: I did not know that! So, what would you rate the movie?
user2: Definitely better than a B, at least A- to me
user1: I definitely agree! I would  have said A- to A.
user2: These types of films are just never given high ratings by critics, for whatever reason.
user1: The critical responses to the movie didn't seem to warrant the rating the critic's gave it. There was no definite criticism, but rather a certain applaud to Reeves for reentering the genre in a positive way.
user2: That was what I noticed as well.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello. Have you seen John Wick?
user1: no
user2: I would like to tell you a little bit about it.
user1: please do
user2: Keanu Reeves stars as Jonathan "John" Wick, an ex-hitman that returns to his former life after the death of his wife in a run-in with a Russian crime syndicate.
user1: who else is in the movie?
user2: Michael Nyqvist is Viggo, the head of the Tarasov family with questionable background. Alfie Allen as Iosef, the arrogant son of Viggo. And Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins, a former acquaintance of John.
user1: Does it have an IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes rating?
user2: It got 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, an average 6.9/10. There is also a Metacritic score of 68/100.
user1: Can you tell me a little more?
user2: It's a neo-noir action movie. The film is full of movement and action.
user1: How are the special effects?
user2: Wick had the reputation of being the best assassin, with the nickname of "Baba Yaga." He retired to marry Hellen, but to retire Viggo gave him an "impossible task," which Wick carried out successfully.
user1: What are any negative aspects of the movie you had?
user2: It is violent, and focuses mostly on action.
user1: Did Keanu Reeves fulfill his part in your opinion?
user2: Yes, he did well in his role. He showed his strength as an action movie star.
user1: What did you like the most about this movie?
user2: It was paced well, with periods of intense action and then a few minutes to "rest" and further the dialog and plot, leading into more action. The film shows Wick as an amazing professional at his sordid job.
user1: well thanks for discussing the movie with me.
user2: You're welcome.
user1: I might look to watch this movie soon
user2: If you like noir type action, I believe you will enjoy this movie.
user1: I am mediocre with action movies but like Reeves'
user2: I will note that it is a revenge movie, and there is virtually no mystery behind the plot. I could summarize one or two scenes, if you like.
user1: please do
user2: John learns that Viggo's son Iosef is protected at Viggo's nightclub.  John enters the club and kills his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape. John retreats to a hotel--the Continental, which caters to the criminal underworld--to treat his injuries. There he is met by an assassin, but John is alerted by a former friend. He subdues the assassin and forces her to reveal where Viggo does business.
user2: In another scene, John travels to a church in Little Russia that serves as Viggo's front, and he dramatically destroys Viggo's cache of money and blackmail material. When Viggo arrives, John ambusheshes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John, but before he kills John, his old friend Marcus intervenes again, allowing Wick to free himself, kill the henchman, and threaten Viggo to reveal his son's location. John immediately travels to the "safe house" and kills Iosef.
user2: It was nice talking. Good day.

user1: They keep you engaged and waiting for the next move, of course. 
user2: keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, alfie Allen and the likes
user2: John used to be a hitman but retired 
user1: He had a funny nickname
user1: Where did he get that from, Baba Yaga?
user2: i don't remember the name though but keanu was the main character
user1: He is supernatural
user2: yeah 
user1: He flies around. 
user2: i just love the scene where he killed everybody to get to aurelio
user2: how would you rate the movie ?
user1: Based on suspense and the characters, I would say about an 8, with 10 being the highest rating, what about you?
user2: it is one of those movies i would watch countless times, so i would give it a 9
user2: plus i do like movies directed by Chad Stalheski
user1: Yes, a lot going on! Especially when he wanted to retire and marry Helen, then he was given a serious task of assassinations 
user2: and that pulled him back again
user2: i think that is not cool
user1: Yeah and then he travels to the safe house and kills him. 
user1: So much going on! very sad with the puppy
user2: i look forward to the next movie all the same 
user1: Especially walking home on the same tracks that Helen and him had their first date. 
user2: i hope his next movie gets a cinema rating of A
user1: Yes, I wonder when the next movie will come out since this was 2014
user2: see you soon

user2: it does not say whether its PG or R
user2: and no puppy killings are not cool...lol
user1: I am definitely more bothered by the puppy-killing than the car-stealing...   Any other info on the movie I should know about?
user2: its an action movie his wife was killed by the russian syndicate thats why the puppy was so important, it is about him getting revenge for the car and the puppy

conversation:
user1: Have you seen John Wick?
user2: I have not seen that movie
user1: Do you like Action films?
user2: Not a big fan of them, but I like a few of them
user1: How about Keanu Reeves? Fan at all?
user2: I have seen some of his movies, like Matrix. I am a fan of Liam Neeson in action movies
user2: or Denzel Washington
user1: John Wick is about  an ex-hitman who returns to the criminalunderworld following the death of his wife and a run-in with a Russian Crime Syndicate. Would you consider watching?
user2: I would love to. Actually I like the trailer of John Wick 2.
user1: That was excellent too. Maybe better than Jonhn Wick. John Wick did have a lot of pretty good actors.
user1: Do you like Director Chad Staheiski?
user2: I watch his hunger games and captain america. I think I like him.
user2: oh, it seems he did not direct those, sorry.
user1: Its ok.... John Wick received a CinemaScore: B I think it was better than that.
user2: did you watch the second movie, John Wick 2. How about that?
user1: I did. That was really good as well. Maybe better than the first. But I would suggest watching John Wick first. That way you get the gist of the series.
user2: Yep, I can take a look at it. Is there any other well-known actor/est in the movie?
user1: I remembe John Leguazamo
user1: I hope I spelled it right.
user1: Michael Nygvist
user2: I think I got who you are mentioning
user1: There were so many good fighting scene
user1: scenes
user2: Ohh, I thought it is all going to be guns and shooting after you said hit-man.
user2: I guess there are car chasing too.
user1: Yes  in one scene Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance,sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subduePerkins. He forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's front, knocks herunconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin Harry to await punishment.
user2: who is Viggo :)
user2: who are these people? Viggo, Harry, Marc?
user1: Participants in the movie. Most likely other hitmans. Since that's all you'll see in this movie.
user2: I can give it a try. It sounds exciting.
user2: I like crime movies with a little bit action, but not too much.
user1: I don't think you'll regret it.
user1: Oh no.. John wick is action packed.
user2: Is there anything else you want to tell about the movie?
user1: That is fun as well. Definitely not a family movie though.
user2: I get that from the beginning :)
user2: well, thanks for the info
user1: My pleasure. Watch John Wick. Have a good night
user2: you too

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hiya!
user1: I have a quick question. Do you like action movies?
user2: Yes, I do.
user1: Well, then I have a treat for you! I would recommend the film John Wick. It's the best action movie out there and it's 4 years old.
user2: What is it about?
user1: The story follows a man named John Wick, which is played by Keanu Reeves who is an ex hitman that is trying to live a normal life after his wife dies.
user2: It sounds interesting!
user1: It's actually pretty good story wise. I really don't want to spoil it for you. I think its a refreshing for the guys because there isn't any of the fluff you see in other movies.
user1: It not your basic shoot everyone kind of film, every action has a purpose and I think thats is what I enjoy the most.
user1: If you like Keanu Reeves you'll love him in this film
user2: Ahh, yes. I prefer a solid story as well.
user2: Does it have a happy ending?
user1: That's a good question. In my opinion yes but it leaves a "To be continued" kind of vibe to it if you know what I mean.
user2: I do. How did his wife die?
user1: It's never explained in the film which is strange, they sort of elude to an illness but its not confirmed ever.
user1: They focus on the things the wife leaves behind for him to heal from her passing
user2: What is his involvement with people he is going after?
user1: Well his wife arranged for him to have a puppy delivered to his home after she dies. Wick also has a favorite car and a russian thug breaks into his home and kills the dog and steals the car.
user2: So he goes after them? That's bold. He is special or just ordinary? For example, does he has special fighting skills?
user1: He is actually feared by everyone in the film because of the things that he's done. The person he's going after happens to be the son of a big Russian mob boss. His father is scared to death of Wick, because he gave John an impossible task and completed it with no problems.
user1: He commented to his son that they call John "Baba Yaga", which means boogeyman in Russian.
user2: Did the Russians know who he was or did they just pick a random car to steal?
user1: The son had no idea who John was. He thought he was just some random guy.
user1: When his dad finds out he beats his son up and explains just how serious of a problem he caused.
user2: That sounds interesting. Does it have a lot of CGI?
user1: It has absolutely ZERO CGI which is a major plus and I think that's why a lot of action movie lovers like it too.
user2: I think that makes for a better action movie. It relies on the story and the stunt men!
user1: Every scene is realistic and shot in one sequence. When an action scene starts, there is never any cutting to another angle.
user1: No magically reloaded guns, no close up shots,etc.
user2: It sounds like a good quality action movie. I'm always annoyed by magical guns with unlimited ammo.
user2: I feel it takes away from the movie because I get stuck on the lack of plausibility. 
user2: When did you say it came out again?
user1: Exactly, I think the director did a good job on it in my opinion.
user1: The movie came out in 2014 with good scores on rotten tomatoes.
user2: Awesome. I will have to check it out. Thank you!
user1: No problem I guarantee you'll enjoy it
user1: have a good day!
user2: You too!

user2: good movie
user1: what did you like about it?
user2: dont miss with a man with past
user2: how about you?
user1: it was repetitive. I think it should have had more humor and a bit less action. it got to be too much.

user1: are you surprised it didn't get higher ratings?
user2: i dont

user1: I really like Keanu Reeves too. 
user2: It came out in 2014. It's strange that I have not heard about it much.
user1: That's true. I guess it didn't get the press it deserved.
user2: it did not get a bad score on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: REally? Do you know the score it got?
user2: Yeah, it said it was 8 out of 10
user1: Odd. But then again, we can catch it on Cable or Netflix

user1: Me too! I love action movies
user2: Does the story seem interesting to you?
user1: I think so . Maybe I'll check out Netflix and see if its available.
user2: I do not know the director Chad Stahelski, or David Leitch
user1: I think I heard of Leitch. Supposed to be pretty good. 
user2: The Viggo character looks interesting
user1: Yeah, I agree with that. Should be a good movie
user2: Yeah, it had an 86% average on rotten tomatoes
user1: Thats pretty high. It has to be an exciting movie. Surprised it just disappeared
user2: The metacritic score was 68/100 which is not good
user1: Ah ha! That explains it. Must be more users of metacritic than rotten tomatos. Unfair that one site can destroy a good movie
user2: It seems like there were mixed reactions
user1: Arent there always mixed reactions? Seems like we all like different things.
user2: One critic said it was like a B movie. That just made it sound better to me
user1: Ha! I agree. They're usually more entertaining anyway'

user2: the movie has alot of chasing and fight scenes
user1: yes it does. it involves a russian mobs and henchman that wicks have to fight

user1: Okay, great. When was it released in theaters?
user2: 2014
user1: That's right. Who stars in this movie?
user2: Keanu Reeves
user1: Is there anyone else in it?
user1: Who co-stars in it?
user2: Michael Nyquist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe 
user1: What is this movie about?
user2: An Ex-hitman who return to the criminal underworld following the death of his wife
user1: What is this movie rated?
user2: it's rated R
user1: What did you like most about this movie?
user2: I loved the action scenes.  How one man takes down a group of heavily armed individuals without a weapon, so good!
user1: Are the reviews for this movie good?
user2: They are mixed, Rotten tomatoes gave it an 86% and Cinema score gave it a B
user1: Do you think I should watch it?
user2: If you are interested in action thrillers of a man wronged trying to seek vengeance.  Absolutely!
user1: How long is it?
user2: it's around 2 hours.
user1: Did it win any awards?
user2: No, It didn't

conversation:
user2: I just saw the movie, "John Wick."
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: Yes I've seen the movie
user2: Did you like it?
user1: If your like gore and destruction with soft under lying theme of puppy.
user2: Yes, that is what some of the critics said. That it is a pretty violent and humorless film, with wick seeking revenge for the death of his puppy.
user2: It received a rotten tomatoes score of 89%. Do you agree with this rating?
user1: Really don't remember much about the movie except the violent spurts and they were not memorable.
user2: Have you seen other keanu reeves films before?
user1: The rating should be lower, no redeeming value. yes saw reeves in other movies.
user2: Ya, again the critics say it's just a b-movie action film - all about the movement, but not much depth. Do you normally like his other movies?
user1: I mcan watch this type movie in te moment, but do not recall plot or content. Did you like it?
user2: It was ok. Glad I saw it, but wouldn't watch it again. I couldnt take keanu seriously in the role.
user1: Really intriquing how movies like this are produced.
user2: The one part I personally found funny was how keanu was named the Russian guys best assasin, baba yaga. In russian, baba yaga is an old witch that rides in a mortar and lives in a hut with chicken legs. So that wasn't really a compliment.
user1: Tsarnov has passion to avenge son and the violence is turned on him.
user2: Apparently, both Chad stahelski and David Leitch directed the film, but only stahelski received credit. 
user2: Have you heard of either of these directors?
user1: Leitch was lucky.
user1: Haven't heard of them before.
user1: There is Jphn Wick 2, Don't know if they directed.
user2: Lol, he knew to cut his losses early. I wonder if they made the sequel because they were planning on it in the beginning by leaving the first movies ending open-ended rather than because the first movie was so successful.
user2: I haven't seen the second one. Is it any better?
user1: More of the same, but more mindless violence.
user2: Are any of the same characters in it: viggo, iosef, ms. Perkins?
user1: Really don't remember just continuation of mindless violence.
user2: Lol, what about when he is reunited with the puppy? How was that scene?
user2: Oh wait, I guess it's a new puppy
user1: Yeah, it is a new dog. bRINGS BACK MEMORIES.
user2: Seems like people are torn on this movie. Either like and appreciate it for what it is, or pretty much disappointed.
user1: By the way Bridgette Moynihan was Tom Brady's first wife. Learned that during the Super Bowl. She stars on Bluebloods as Erin
user2: Ha! Don't get me started on tom Brady and the superbowl! I can't picture who she is though...
user1: She is the daughter who  is the autorney.

user1: What movie is it?
user1: I do enjoy his movies
user2: The movie is called John Wich, have you watched it?
user1: Yes I have watched both of them
user2: sorry, typo...John Wick :-)
user1: If you haven't watched them they are action movies
user2: No, I haven't watched it
user1: Do you have an aversion to violence?
user2: but I read is also a bit of a thriller
user2: no, I don't mind violence, as long as it is not splatter
user2: do you enjoy this kind of movies?
user1: There is a bit of that, in my opinion those movies are over-the-top, but in a good way
user1: I do like them
user2: I read John Wick is an ex=hitman
user2: a bit of a criminal
user1: Yeah he was retired until some gangsters stole his car and killed his dog, which was a gift from his recently deceased wife
user2: did you say there have been more than one of the john wick movies?
user1: There are two
user1: I really didn't start enjoying Keanu Reeves movies until his part in The Matrix. 
user1: I couldn't stand to watch those Bill & Ted movies
user2: Well, I take in John Wick he has kind of steered in a different direction. Do you recall any particular scene of the movie you particularly enjoyed?
user1: The majority of the movies are gun porn. There is a scene where these Russian gangsters are sent to his home to kill him, I remember the acrobatics and overall composition of this scene being quite memorable.
user2: What about the scene where he fights with Viggo?
user1: The final fight was okay, but I kind of had to suspend belief and just go along for the ride. I felt this way because the guy seemed so old to me that Wick should have been able to beat him easily. i guess this could be explained away by how much abuse he had already taken earlier.
user2: From all you say, and what I read, I don't understand why it has been rated only as a "B" by the critique. Do you know why this could be?
user1: It's a campy film in my opinion, not meant to be taken too seriously. That's one of it's strong points in my opinion, but maybe that's not enough for the critic in question. Who was the reviewer?
user2: I don't know exactly who is behind CinemaScore, but they gave a B to the movie
user1: Well a B isn't bad, especially for the type of movie it is.
user1: It was good enough for a sequel
user1: That is, it made enough money at the Box Office to warrant a sequel
user2: Well, I suppose it must have made enough money to warrant the second movie
user2: I see also Wollem Dafoe was part of the casr
user2: part of the cast
user2: which character did he play?
user1: He was another hitman, who was also friends with John Wick
user2: I can see Dafoe as a hitman, suits him very well
user1: I think his character was called Marcus
user2: If you were to give a score to the movie, what would you give it?
user1: Viggo killed him though, because he wouldn't kill Wick
user1: On a scale of 5 stars, I personally would give it 4 stars, but of course that's subjective.
user2: That is good score. Not having watched it, I would probably tempted to watch it based on the information
user1: If you like John Woo type action flicks, then I recommend you check it out.
user1: Is that the only movie were supposed to talk about?
user2: I suppose so, I only have info about this movie
user1: Too bad, I enjoy talking about movies
user2: I suppose there is only so much you can talk about a single movie, besides going through the whole story line
user1: Did you have any other questions about it?
user2: Is there any particularly "emotional" scene in the movie?
user2: I mean, not for the action
user1: It may not seem that important, but when his dog dies
user2: How does the dog die?
user1: There's also the moment when he recieves the dog and he flashes back to memories of his wife
user1: When the russian guys break in his house the first time to steal his car, they kill the dog
user2: And is there any scene where you feel like wanting to join John seeking revenge, or the movie keeps a sort of distance?
user1: Not me personally, I'm always nothing more than a viewer of a film. I never get so wrapped up in a movie emotionally that I begin to feel what the person feels. I can relate, but it's not my story.
user2: I wish I was so detached when watching movies. Probably I would have not felt emotionally involved with this movie either, but there have been other movies where I just couldn't help.
user2: I'm curious, you mentioned John's wife... what happened to her?
user1: Well, everyone is different, it's not a good or bad thing, it's just the way we choose to absorb said form of entertainment.
user1: Honestly I forgot, I think she had cancer.
user2: Is that part of John memories?
user1: I only remember that shortly after her death he receives a puppy that his wife scheduled to be delivered after her passing to help him deal with the grief.
user2: So, although she is not an active character in the movie, she is the main motivation for him to seek revenge, isn't she?
user1: I guess you could say that. I would be hard pressed to find the death of a puppy and the theft of a classic automobile as reason enough to go on a murderous rampage, but then again, I was never a hitman.
user1: While I would love to keep talking about this I think we have more than filled our quota of twelve responses, we've been at it for almost an hour. So I will say, it has been nice talking with you, and I hope you have a great day.
user2: Indeed, nice to talk to you, and you too have a great day. Bye

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello, have you seen John Wick?
user2: I have not, I heard it was a good one though
user1: It's awesome.  If you are into action movies it's really good.
user2: Was that the one about the ex hitman?
user1: Yeah and people kill his dog.
user2: I love action movies
user2: oh that is sad. Poor dog
user1: Keanu Reeves is a beast in John Wick.
user2: He is a great actor, love his movies
user1: He's the one.
user1: Keanu drives a mustang in the movie.  Do you like mustangs?
user2: Love mustangs
user1: The movie has another muscle car but I forget what it is.
user2: yeah im not sure since i have not scene it
user2: I heard there was a good scene where they changed the vin numbers on the mustang
user1: Yeah John Legazomo *sic* runs the chop shop.
user2: Arent they in New York city also?
user1: I think so, but not 100% sure.
user1: Keanu stays at some awesome hotel for hitmen in the movie.
user2: i should really see it, i know it came out in 2014 so a few years ago 
user1: I thought it would suck but was suprised how fun it was.
user2: The puppy was a gift from his wife, that is sad they killed it
user1: Yeah it's really messed up.  If you like dogs it will upset you.
user2: I do like dogs, have a few of my own
user1: The movie starts slow then it's all action for like an hour straight.
user2: I love when they really get into the action. Seems this movie does that for sure
user1: It's basically John Wick vs everyone.
user2: he must  be quite a guy, sure sounds like it
user1: He's like if the terminator met John McClain from Die Hard.
user2: OOh Loved both of those movies
user1: I recommend it.

conversation:
user2: Hi! Have you had a chance to see the movie, John Wick?
user1: I just finished it. It wasn't bad. 
user1: I like action movies. Do you?
user2: I love action movies especially with a story. This background story was a bit thin but it works.
user1: I totally agree. The plot was barely there but the action was great!
user2: What did you think of Keanu Reeves?
user1: Oh, he was all right. He is kind of a blah actor but he did the action scenes well. I liked the Ms. Perkins character though
user2: Keanu was totally dead pan. He relentlessly pursued the Russian mob. What did you think of his focus?  
user1: He was certainly focused on the car and the poor puppy. I don't know if that's deadpan or dumb honestly... but it works okay.
user1: (have you gotten a second paragraph of text yet?)
user2: It is so true. He was will do die for the dog and the car.  I believe that was somewhat deliberate.
user1: the whole russian mob in new york city is a bit played out though. 
user1: they tried to use it to create a plot but it was so predictable
user2: What did you think of the Russian mobster's son stealing the car and taking it to the shop that the owner knew it was John Wick's?
user1: very predictable. i could almost recite the dialog without having seen it.
user1: i like knowing the back story of how john and helen got married though
user2: I thought the father was a very convincing Russian mobster.
user1: he was. just like the godfather
user2: I was thinking the same thing. He knew his son was wrong but he stood by him and was almost forced to fight John Wick.
user1: viggo must have been surprised when john was able to complete the impossible task
user2: I love the part where John is at the hotel and Ms Perkins tries to kill him.
user1: yeah, that was good action. but i don't like watching men beat up women. i'm glad it wasn't too graphic.
user1: i don't know why john had to destroy viggo's money though. you'd think he could do something better with it.
user2: The part of Mrs Perkins was a bit like James Bond. I think the burning of the money was to hurt the Mob and make the point that he couldn't be bought.
user1: i've never actually seen a james bond movie, but i'll take your word for it
user1: yes, burning the money always pisses off the mob
user2: I also liked the hotel desk clerk, Marcus. He was discreet and helped John .
user1: and the new dog at the end... always coming full circle. a typically american ending
user2: I think after all of the violence, it shows redeeming qualities in John Wick.
user1: i guess so, but that was already made clear by his wanting out of the underworld
user1: i guess it shows his determination to stay out
user2: Did you have a favorite part of the story?
user1: i liked the ending. that's where it all comes together and is tied up with a neat little bow. how about you?
user2: I thought the fight with Ms Perkins was good and especially that he did not kill her.
user2: And yes the puppy at the end was so fitting

conversation:
user1: let me start off by saying, i have not seen this movie so bear with me. LOL
user2: please tell me about the movie
user1: Alright, I know it stars keanu reeves
user1: who is basically a an awesome actor in all respects so thats pretty cool
user2: ah, vata that it must be of suspense or action?
user1: It seems he is an ex hitman who returns to the criminal underground following the death of his wife and a run in with a russian crime group
user1: yeah, kind of an action/suspense/thriller movie
user1: from what i can gather from the document
user2: Interesting ah and what year is it?
user1: 2014
user2: I'm really interested in seeing her
user1: yeah, i might watch it myself actually
user1: sounds interesting
user2: How many times have you seen it?
user1: i dont watch many movies.. but this one sounds out my alley. I havent seen it yet actually. 
user1: it starts out with people getting punched lol. Every action movie on the planet. 
user1: from the sounds of it, its kind of like a mob/ganster movie as well
user2: Well, everything that tells me how great this film seems to be is excellent
user1: yeah, it looks good to me as well. It got an 86% on rotten tomatoes which means it cant be that bad. 
user2: hahaha I understand how cool this is, tell me how much longer this chat will last
user1: It takes 12 turns. We are supposed to talk about the movie during that time. Ill let you know when its time to finish. I turk for a living so i do this stuff all day.
user2: Oh it's great I like the idea, I also earn my living with this. Well very well, tell me as follows the plot in this movie.
user1: He goes to russia at some point apparently to find the russian crimes boss
user1: and get some sort of blackmail material
user2: oh ok then this involved russia must be quite complex the synnosis
user2: well I think it's complex and innovative batsante, the films of this actor are very good
user1: I agree keanu reeves is a great actor i love his performance in the matrix
user1: it seems he plays a bit of a similar character in this movie
user1: Based off of what i can tell, hes like the good guy criminal
user1: if you know what i mean
user1: you still here?
user2: yes i am 
user1: ok just making sure
user1: apparently at some point in the movie john tortures someone
user1: so thats interesting
user1: if you replay one more time i think this will be over

conversation:
user1: Hello 
user2: Hello. Shall we talk about the movie John Wick? I have seen it and can highly recommend it.
user2: The movie is about a retired hitman who is forced to get revenge on some of his former employers.
user1: Sure - can you tell me about it?
user1: "forced" by whom? 
user2: I say 'forced.' The main character, played by Keanu Reeves, is treated horribly by the arrogant son of the crime bosses he used to work for. As in, beaten up, his car stolen, and his new puppy killed by them. They just think he's some guy with a nice car.
user1: I really like Keanu Reeves - and that does sound interesting! 
user1: What did you say the name of this movie is? 
user2: It's called John Wick. It's action-heavy, but it's got some humor, too. Lots of fun cameos as well. Like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe
user1: Not familiar with those names, is this a new movie? 
user2: It's from 2014, so somewhat new.
user1: Honestly, I was just looking at a description of it - you've gotten me interested 
user2: I was surprised when I watched it, too. It was a lot better than it sounded. The plot is sort of thin, as in a guy goes on a killing streak for being treated awfully. But it really is worth watching
user1: I'll be sure to check it out - thanks! 
user1: I liked Keanu Reeves in The Matrix - have you seen that? 
user2: I like the Matrix a lot. The first one, not the sequels, though.
user2: What did you like about The Matrix?
user1: I agree. Wouldn't even typically watch that kind of a movie, except that I kept hearing from people that "I really needed to see it" 
user1: Its actually more of a documentary, than faction - as it turns out. 
user2: Yeah. John Wick is the same kind of thing. "Need to see it." Not for the plot, but for the world they create. There's a secret assassin underworld. Special hotels, special night clubs, etc.
user1: Really? I wouldn't think there are that many assassins to create whole business's around them! 
user1: Are you familiar with the CIA "heart-attack gun"? Its just like it sounds...
user2: Yeah, it sort of went a bit far with the special services. But they were only located in major cities.
user2: Well, John Wick is a lot less serious than real CIA stuff. It's amusing rather than disturbing.
user1: Sure. Actually, watching all the revelations that are finally coming to the fore - is better than ANY movie I've ever seen! Do you know who the BIGGEST drug dealers in the world are/have always been? 
user2: Anyway, you might enjoy John Wick. It sounds silly, but it's quite a lot of fun
user1: No, doesn't sound silly - I'm from Chicago and spent many years in the restaurant business...lol 
user1: Knew them "all" - the mobsters and their counterparts, law enforcement 
user2: Well, the hotel scenes/night club scenes might be of interest to you. Made it seem pretty interesting/glamorous, rather than what a life as a paid killer probably was
user2: It was the best thing Keanu was in since the Matrix, I'd say
user1: LOL - people also think that the restaurant business is "glamorous" too. Its NOT. Its hard work, long hours, with weekends and holidays 
user2: Glamorous people might come to a restaurant, but someone has to cook them the food and throw away what they don't eat. I'm sure life in the restaurant is a lot more difficult.
user1: Okay, well thanks so much for telling me about it. Will definitely check it out!Looks like we've chatted to someone's satisfaction here, as "finish conversation" has now enabled. Have a great day!
user2: Thanks!

conversation:
user2: Saw trailers of this and it looked interesting however I have not watched.
user1: I think the plot is a bit out there and very unrealistic. I could see why he would be mad about his puppy dying and his car getting stolen but its not enough for him to want to go after someone.  
user1: Also I've never watched the movie either,
user2: All in all I like Keanu Reeves, but I see what you are saying.  Probably the puppy and the car were meant to catch our attention.
user1: Yeah, i do wonder when the next movie is coming out though. It does say that it was the first installment. 
user2: I don't know if TV is so crappy at this point we are grasping at anything.
user1: i agree.
user2: Because of that, I think I will probably give it a try.
user1: Yeah it wouldn't hurt to watch it. Maybe it was more of a sadistic comedy and we wouldn't know that unless we sat down and watched it.
user1: who knows?
user2: thanks.. Bye.
user1: peace 
user1: wait it said we had to answer 12 or times to get paid 
user2: Sorry.  Thought it said 3 conversations.
user1: i just read the task it said that we had to talk about four documents and we get three turns to talk about each document 
user1: you have to keep scrolling to see each document 
user2: Which then equals the 12.
user1: exactly 
user2: So where are our new conversations?
user1: i dont know ut the document just refreshed 
user1: well okay in this document it saying how the dad gave his own son 
user1: he gave his own son up to be killed 
user1: not mention that john wick proved that he was going to get him one way or another 

conversation:
user2: You should check out the movie John Wic. It has 86% approval on Rotten Tomatoes, which is hard to get!
user1: This sounds like a great film but I don't understand the title of the movie.  Who stars in it?
user2: It starts KEanu Reeves as a ex-hitman who returns to the criminal underworld following the death of his wife, John Wick.
user1: OIC.  Is this movie at the theater now or on streaming channels like Netflix?
user2: It's streaming on channels like Netflix because it came out in 2014.
user1: Cool.  I hope it does not any scenes where there are children or animals.  I don't like violent movies for the most part.  It sounds like this one has a lot guns and fighting.  Is there a lot bad language too?
user2: There is a lot of violence in the movie but it's meant to be fun in a B-movie kind of way. Reeves acts with a deadpan kind of style that should make you laugh more than it would offend you.
user1: What can you tell me about adult content?  Is this something my 12 year old can watch without getting embarrassed? 
user2: It's a fast paced thriller that should be fine for your family but unfortunately I cannot confirm the rating of the film for you.
user1: Great!  Well, I do like everything this actor has made.  I bet I enjoy this one too.
user2: I am glad to hear it! There are also other distinguished actors like Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones) And Michael Nyqvist so hopefully you will indeed find it entertaining.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: John Wick is an incredible action movie about a retired hitman who gets dragged back into the game over the petty reason of some people killing his dog.
user2: Cool. Who is in the movie?
user1: Keanu Reeves after being absent a bit from the genre, I normally shy away from him but he really does a good job
user2: What is the rating for the movie?
user1: Rotten tomatoes gave it a 86%, metacritic 68/100, CinemaScore: B
user2: That's pretty good. Is the movie rated R?
user1: The action is over the top and quick, and it is extremely violent, its not a smart movie but its a fun watch. It's rated R definetly
user2: Sounds like an entertaining movie. How long is it?
user1: I can't exactly recall, but its about your standard movie length
user2: Cool. Would it be a good movie to watch with my girlfriend?
user1: It also contains Michael Nygvist, Alfie Allen and Adrianne Palicki
user1: If your girlfriend likes over the top action and isn't squeamish about violence, it can be a fun watch, but I'd warn anyone going into it about the dog plotline in case they would be upset over it
user2: Is it on DVD or available to download?
user1: Certainly
user2: Sounds like a movie I would like. Is there anything else about it I should know?
user1: I would watch it for the action sequences, but don't go in expecting Shakespeare  :P
user2: Haha. So the story line is simple?
user1: It was directed by Chad Stahelski in 2014, so I'd imagine it is available for download and dvd by now
user1: Yep, his dead wife's dog is killed in a break-in so he seeks revenge :P
user2: Haha. Sounds like a standard action movie plot line.
user1: Its not a very humorous movie, keanu reeves is very deadpan
user1: and its keanu reeves so if you've ever seen something by him, you probably know what you are getting from him
user2: Yeah he's not the most exciting on screen but I like his movies.
user2: I think i'll watch this one.
user2: Definitely seems like a movie to watch to past the time. 
user1: there are worse ways to spend your time
user2: Lol. Probably will watch it alone too. Not with the girl friend.
user1: that dog plot can be a bit rough, I love dogs and it got to me for a minute
user2: That bad?
user1: it wasn't gorey, but it made me a little sad
user1: looks like a finish conversation button just appeared, goodbye friend
user2: later

conversation:
user2: Hi what is the name of the movie? 
user1: John Wick
user1: This movie is about an ex-hitman
user2: What does he have to do? 
user1: John Wick is out for revenge because his vintage car was stolen and his puppy was killed. His ex-wife gave him the puppy.
user1: Well, deceased wife.
user1: Not ex-wife.
user2: He's out for revenge because his car was stolen and puppy was killed?  Odd.. Haha what else can you tell me
user1: The Rotten Tomatoes score is 86% but the Metacritic Score is 68/100.
user2: Interesting.  Who acts as John Wick? 
user1: Keanu Reeves
user2: Oh cool.  Are there any other characters? 
user1: Michael Nyqvit stars as Viggo
user2: What is his role?  Is he the bad guy that killed his puppy? 
user1: I'm not sure who killed the puppy directly, but Viggo is the head of the Tarasov family and an "enterprising businessman with questionable roots."
user2: OK.  What is the setting of the movie? 
user1: The movie takes place in New York City
user2: OK how long is the movie? 
user1: It doesn't say
user2: Do you think a child could watch it?

user2: What is the genre
user1: It's an action movie
user1: Have you seen John Wick?
user2: I can't remember,  ive heard the name.

user2: He goes through all of that trouble and ends up getting a new dog? 
user2: What? 
user2: Haha
user1: Yes
user1: He gets a pit bull puppy
user2: Aww, I might just watch it for the puppy.  

conversation:

user2: Really?
user2: What didn’t you like about it?

user1: as an exhit man
user2: Right

user1: oh my favourite scene was when aurelio recognized that the stolen vehicle was for john wick
user2: Would yoy say that was funny?
user2: Is it serious?
user2: Or maybe some other category?
user1: honestly it was not funny, because he punched the the guy when he realised the kind of possible proble that awaits them
user2: Right
user2: So it was a serious scene
user1: yeah but i love the scene when john kiils his way through tthe red circle
user2: Would you watch the movie again?

user2: Hello. The Moive is called John Wick

conversation:
user1: Hey
user1: What movie did they ask you to read about?
user2: Hi! Inception
user2: Oops, its John Wick
user1: Have you seen it?
user1: Wait 1 or 2
user2: Just John Wicks, nope, I haven't seen it.
user1: Oh man, if you like action, you should watch them both
user1: They're great
user1: Wait, are you ok with killing, blood, etc lol
user2: Oh, nice to hear that. I will definitely try to watch them.
user2: Yeah, I love gore as well, lol
user1: He's a legit assassin (I think). I forget what his actual role is
user1: Just that he's insane with a handgun
user2: It must be high Adrenalin stuff.
user1: Yep, good way to put it
user1: They're fairly short from what I remember too. Maybe 90 min
user2: Okay. What else do you like to watch. I am a big Tom Hanks fan.
user1: Hmm
user1: I really liked all of Hank's mystery movies
user1: Like Da Vinci Code and Inferno
user2: John Wick was hugely successful on box office I suppose.
user2: My favorite is Catch Me If You Can.
user1: Uhhhh I'm actually not sure. I ended up bootlegging it because I didn't think it was worth watching on a humungous screen. I have a 60in at home so it worked out.
user1: Leo was awesome in that too
user1: Bridge of Spies - Solid Movie
user2: Ofcourse - high emotion drama. I got really emotional at the end.
user1: You know which of his movies was a flop that I was genuinely sad about? Because it wasn't done well
user1: The Circle. It had Emma in it! I mean cmonn
user1: Tom was in it too
user2: I haven't seen that, is it a really good one?

conversation:
user1: Hi there.
user2: hello
user2: how are you
user1: I just saw the movie John Wick, I thought Keanu Reeves did really well in it.
user1: Oh, I am good.
user2: ok thats good, Yes I seen the movie John wick also
user2: i seen the first part and scond
user1: I really liked it due to the awesome action packed scenes in it.
user2: do you like action movies like this?
user1: yeah, absolutely.
user2: yea the beginning was surprising 
user2: the guy didnt know who he was messing with
user1: Haha, nope! I loved that he played a bad boy in it, after such a tragic loss.
user2: yea he was really skilled with a weapon
user1: I really liked how the plot unfolded.
user1: What did you think about the scene in the chop shop?
user2: yea that seen was  nice
user2: scene*
user2: that was a plot twist
user1: I really liked when John stepped foot in the Red Circle and unleashed Hell on everyone, lol.
user1: Even if he does get a bit injured.
user2: yea he really was a professional hit man
user2: the guy put his father in problems
user1: I think with this type of movie you need to be. I expected there to be a lot of action, and murder but not to the extent that happened.
user1: What did you think of the helicopter scene?
user2: lol yea i he killed a lot of guys
user2: i think that scene was pretty exciting
user1: I thought so too! Especially at the docks when Viggo got into a fist fight with John.
user2: yea he even got stabbed
user1: Wasn't expecting anyone to pull out a knife, dirty fighting techniques.
user2: that dog meant a lot to him

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi have you seen the first "John Wick"?
user1: No, I haven't,,,,,have you?
user2: Yes it's an outstanding action movie. Maybe a bit over the top but it is entertainment. Do you like action films? 
user1: I do like action films but it mainly depends on who is in it
user1: Who are actors?
user2: This is a Keanu Reeves film. I cant decide if his dry, semi-stolid, personality fits or not. It has a lot of violence so the it fits the action bill.
user2: Keanu Reeves, Alfie Allen, Michael Nyqvist, Adrianne Palicki and John Leguizamo
user1: The cast is good, I will consider watching this  movie
user1: Who is your favorite actor from this list?
user2: You should. You'll enjoy it. Tough to say. You get mostly Keanu through the majority of the film. Leguizamo plays a dirt bag well. 
user2: He definitely gets the look and tones right anyway. 
user1: Oh, but sounds interesting 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey, how are you?
user1: So the document I have is a synopsis about the movie, John Wick, have you seen that movie?
user1: It stars Keanu Reeves as the main character.
user1: Action packed, shoot em up, murder, revenge, that kind of thing.
user2: No I have not seen this movie
user2: I love Keanu Reeves. How was the movie?

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?
user2: Hello
user1: Good and you?
user2: Great! Have you seen John Wick? Willem Dafoe is a good actor
user2: Keanu Reeves plays the role of a used-to-be hitman. I'm sure you've heard of it
user1: Yes! It is a great movie. 
user1: Yes. I knew he was going to get the men back once they killed his dog!
user2: Yes! The must pay at that point, they forced him back into the life
user2: That was all left living from his wife after she died
user1: Yeah, I think he was going to call it quits so he could spend time with his sick wife.
user2: What would you rate the movie? I'd say it's a solid B
user1: I would say it was more of a B+ for me. it had great action!
user1: How the movie ended do you think there will be another one?
user2: But I have to admit that it was hilarious also, that's hard to do. Ferocity and humor
user2: Possibly, if Keanu feels like it hehe
user1: You can't forget the revenge thriller it delivers.
user2: true-director Chad Stahelski never lets me down
user2: There was much pressure on John because he was known as one of the best. I guess many will be after you in this case
user1: Yes, because not only was he the best he was feared!
user1: John learned that Viggo was protected because of the red circle night club.
user2: Yes, but i'm sure Viggo knew it was only a matter of time before he was found. He should have been mentally prepared. Chop shops and hit men in Russia is usually a winning combination, 
user1: Yea that is when they were informed that John was the best assassin 
user1: He gave him that impossible task, but John still succeeded! 
user2: How do you think John felt about Viggo rubbing it in his face? The fact that he had to come back to the life?
user1: I think that only added fuel to the fire.
user1: Marcus did help John a bit in sticky situations.
user1: That allowed John to escape and then he was able to kill Kirill.
user2: Aurelio was not in the mood to deal with the wrath of John was he? He kicked losef out for having the nerve to steal it  Losef got his in the end
user1: Did you think that viggo was going to reveal losef"s location?
user2: Not really, he doesn't seem like one with loose lips
user1: Why do you think Viggo had Marcus killed?
user2: absolutely, kill or be killed
user1: John finally killed Viggo 
user2: why did John allow Viggo to stab him?
user2: Couldn't he have just taken him out?
user1: I think John's mind was some where else.
user2: I think you're right. The ending was just perfect wasn't it? 
user1: Yes! not only did Viggo die. John saved a dog from being killed and now he has a new dog!
user1: Great movie thanks for the chat!

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: HI
user2: have you seen john wick
user1: Yes, I loved it
user1: was a great comeback for Keanu
user2: yeah i agree
user1: What did you think of the story?
user2: Wonder why the TO rating is so bad for this HIT
user2: Shoot em up, not much for a plot, but the suspense is nice
user1: Not sure, the action is definitely a plus, it really took head shots to the next level
user2: yes the shooting part was insane
user2: has that b movie feel but with a great actor
user2: could of easily been a flop with a different actor
user1: yes definitely, well shot overall
user1: keanu really makes it
user2: what was that move with charleez theron
user2: sorta like john wick
user2: wasn't as good though
user1: i forget the name but i know what you're talking about
user1: how did you think the ending was
user2: totally predicated
user1: i think this was a good sleeper movie, low budget but big hit
user2: I think thats what the movie lacked a little was predictions
user2: the second movie was good as wel
user1: i'm looking forward to the finale 
user2: did they say when its going to release?
user1: not too sure, possibly this year or next?
user2: i guess it will come down to if he dies, or someone takes his spot
user1: possibly or just ends with his dog happy
user2: the ole passing the beton to someone else
user1: makes sense
user1: thanks!

conversation:
user2: Hey have you seen john wick
user1: Yes I have. Great movie
user2: What dos you like about it
user1: Keanu Reeves is really great as the main protagonist and is such a badass. The gunfights and the action are also top tier
user2: Tell me about it. The "gun fu" was awesome. Did you see john wick 2
user1: Yes. It was pretty good but I do not think as good as the first 

conversation:
user2: good evening!
user2: It appears we are talking about john wick tonight
user1: sounds good. have you seen it?
user2: no, but i do know a little about it
user2: Its supposed to be a neo-noir action film
user2: from what i can tell, it seems to be about a russian crime syndicate 
user1: i have seen it. it is a pretty crazy action pic
user2: so im guessing its like a gangster film with keanu reeves
user2: am i right?
user1: Sort of. John Wick is a lone wolf with an unsavory past
user1: His desire for revenge really drives the plot
user2: doesnt his wife get killed or something?
user2: she got mixed up in some stuff inadverntely and he was a hit man yeah?
user1: yup. but it is the fact his dog was killed that really sets him off
user1: the violence is really amazing almost like a ballet
user1: it is not a film for you if are squeamish about violence 
user2: dude, violence is my shit
user2: Sounds totally up my alley
user1: but the violence is really just an elaborate dance. totally unrealistic fantasy 
user2: It has a decent rotten tomatos rating too so it seems worth mytime
user1: not I real thinking movie but I was certainly entertained
user1: must have done at least pretty well at the box office too since they did make a sequel 
user2: have you seen the sequel? 
user1: I have. it was more of the same over the top violence. I honestly can't really distinguish the two 
user2: yeah, even the covers look about the same. Sequals tend to do that
user1: The actor who plays Winston is the same guy from the Deadwood series. The name escapes me right now
user2: oh lord id have no idea i dont watch much tv these days
user1: ah Ian McShane that's it. Leguizamo and Dafoe have really small roles
user1: Keanu can do this type of movie in his sleep.
user2: Im sure he can with all the matrix movies
user2: Loved him in those
user1: Exacty/ my guess is that he gets a big payday to make another one and close out the triology
user2: i heard rumors about that possibly happened
user1: doesn't surprise me at all. certainly has a cult following
user2: lol yeah, and btw, this chat is done
user2: we can finish it up
user1: sweet. good chatting with ya!

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: Have you seen John Wick?
user1: No I haven't.  I would like to though.
user2: It was made in 2014 apparently.
user2: I haven't seen it either.
user2: Do you know who starred in it?
user1: Have you seen it?
user1: Actually no.  I do not know who starred in it.
user2: Keanu Reeves apparently.
user2: I'm not a fan of his.
user1: I like him.  What is movie about?
user2: Just like the reviews say, "deadpan" is his acting style.
user1: But the story may demand that.
user2: That's how he always acts. And the review states that it didn't work here because it wasn't what the story calls for.
user2: Anyway, do you know the director? Chad Stahelski?
user1: Then why is he here?
user1: I am not sure.  What else has he done?
user2: I asked the same question! I don't know about the director, though.
user1: I see.  Do you who else acted in the movie?
user1: Do you know who else acted in the movie.  Sorry for typo.
user2: No worries
user2: Yeah, John Leguizamo is also in it.
user1: Is it a comedy?
user1: That's and odd pair.  It must be a comedy then, right?
user1: Are you still there?
user2: Yes, I'm here.
user2: No, it's an action movie.
user1: That's good.  You never when people leave or get disconnected.  What kind of action movie?
user2: It's an action thriller.
user2: Keanu Reeves is a retired hitman
user1: What's the story line?
user1: Retire but what?  He comes out of retirement to save the world?
user2: That's what it seems liek
user2: like
user2: The reviews say that it's a great B movie
user1: So we end up with whole lot of dead people?

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hi there, how are you doing?

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hey how are you?
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user2: It does not get very good ratings
user1: I think the ratings are pretty good for what the movie was.
user1: Have you seen this movie beore?
user2: No I have not!
user2: I am not familiar with Keanu Reeves are you?
user1: Yes  he does  pretty good action movies.Well what do you think of the plot from what we read?
user2: I like action movies but this one does not seem to be what I like. 
user2: what do you think of it?
user1: A hitman goes on a killing spree for killing his puppy I could understand you're reasoning lol
user1: I think its pretty interesting tho reading it on paper not so much.
user2: I like action movies that have a good plot to follow!
user2: I agree that reading about it is different than seeing a trailer!
user2: Are you an "action" or "drama" movie person?
user1: I like the back story of being given a impossible task before retiring.
user1: Not really but I watch few from time time. Like hero  and comic stuff.
user1: Drama
user2: Yes! I am reading about that part. It seem sort of interesting!
user2: Oh my! Seems that the movie gets a little bloody!
user2: There is even a Russian plot to it! 
user1: Yes A lot of killing!
user2: I am not one for shoot em up movies are you? 
user1: Me neither
user1: At least it lives up to the title Assassin
user2: Do you go to the movie theater very much?
user1: No more of a home body especially with films like these.You? 
user1: How did you like the ending?
user2: It was an "ok" ending. What did you think?
user2: I am like you! I find that the cost of theater movies is so high these days. 
user1:  I guess he got his his vengeance?.  
user2: But not his dog!! LoL
user1: Yeah it can be pretty costly, I feel the movie has to be at least worth it.
user2: Well it has been nice chatting with you! Have a nice day!!

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hi there
user2: What did you think of Jonh Wick?
user1: I think he sounds like a really interesting character
user2: He was an interesting character in my opinion. I liked the whole ex hitman trying to get out of his criminal past storyline. I thought the movie was well done overall.
user2: What did you think of the story?
user1: I liked that the motivation to get back into the criminal underworld was the death of his wife, puppy and a stolen car.
user2: Yeah, the revenge plot was good. I actually think it's an interesting twist. Other movies would have the main character be scared of the odds, but in this film, everyone is scared of John.
user2: How would you rate the movie from 1 to 10?
user1: I think I would give it a 9 out of 10 because it sounds like a really good movie
user2: I personally give it a full 10/10, it was a very refreshing film considering all the junk that gets released. It's hard to believe it's been 4 years since it came out.
user2: Do you think the rotten tomatoes score was too low?
user1: I do think it was too low, I dont know how they came up with that score because it was such a good movie
user2: I don't know either, for some reason rotten tomatoes gives terrible movies high scores and great movies low scores. Kind of hard to trust their opinion
user2: What did you think of the villains in the movie? I think Viggo was my favorite.
user1: I agree I like that character too since John worked for him previously
user2: How did you think Keanu Reeve did? I thought he really brought the character to life, and was super believeable/
user1: I think he did a great job, it makes you want to see what John Wick's next move with be in another movie
user2: I agree I don't ever recall him being in a horrible movie. I hope they flesh out the movie a bit more in the coming sequels. Did you fully understand the story or did you have things that you missed?
user1: I thought it was well explained, it was a really comprehensible summary of the movie
user2: What did you think f Viggo's son? I think they did a good job of making you hate his character. I found him obnoxious for some reason.
user1: I agree, I think that being Viggo's son was the first thing that makes you dislike him then when he steals Johns car that is the topping to disliking this character
user2: Viggo himself was likable, funny even at some points. What did you think of the action sequences? I found them to be really enjoyable, everything was just one full scene, no cuts or anything.
user1: I think it was an action packed movie that kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next.
user2: I agree! Are there any other characters you specifically liked in the film?
user2: I specifically liked Winston, I think there is more to him than the movie lets on.
user2: Did I lose you there friend?
user1: no sorry i had to  pick up my child from school
user2: Oh, good I was close to aborting. I asked you a few questions earlier that you missed.
user1: i am reading them now
user1: I think Perking seem like a sneaky but interesting character
user1: Perkins*
user2: Yeah, she did seem to have a bit more to her than normal. Now that you mention her I wish they gave more information on her character.
user2: What did you think of the continental? Pretty cool assassins only hotel where they are safe from business. 
user1: That is a crazy themed hotel, do you think they actually get a good night sleep there or would they be on edge that they might be one of the assasins next hit?
user2: Well in John's case I'd be on edge, as for everyone else it seems like there has never been a problem lol.
user1: I really liked the ending where he rescues a pit bull puppy that was to be killed. It just sort of gives a whole circle to the movie that ties the beginning to the end
user2: Yes, the end was perfect I think. Makes me want to watch it again. Well I have to head out and it seem you have things to do yourself!
user2: Have a good rest of your day!
user1: have a great day!

conversation:
user1: Hello, the movie is John Wick. I don't think you should watch it.
user2: ?What type of movie is it
user1: An action movie but a sort of B-movie.
user2: Does it have any good actors in it?
user1: Not really. It has Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyquist, Alfie Allen, and Adrianne Palicki.
user2: What is the plot?
user1: A retired hitman seeks revenge after his car is stolen and his puppy has been killed.
user2: Revenge over a dead dog?  Sounds like something a middle school student would do
user1: I agree except that in the case of this movie, apparently a whole Russian Crime Syndicate is involved.
user2: Oh crap the  Russians are into everything    
user2: They are even killing pets
user1: Hahaha. In one of the scenes in the movie, there's a Russian syndicate that runs a car chop shop in NYC.
user2: Why do all the movies happen in NYC?  
user2: There are tones of Russians here in Florida
user2: And the weather is so much better
user2: Who has the lead role in this movie
user1: Good question. Also, why do so many cars get trashed in movies? This one features a chop shop and a scene in  which a black SUV gets smashed.
user1: That'd be Keanu Reaves who seems to specialize in movies with car crashes.
user2: Its always the Black Suvs that get smashed.
user1: Right?
user2: Where are all these chop shops I could use one next time im in a car wreck
user2: Cheap car parts without having to go to the junk yard
user1: Totally! In another scene in the movie features a "safe house" that turns out not to be so safe. Why are safe houses never actually safe in movies?
user2: "Safe" houses in movies are always super nice too.   the goverment is not about to give anything any more than they have to.  They are going to put you in the hood or in a trailer 
user2: With 30 year old furniture that smells
user1: Right? It's not even a govt safe house in this movie - it's all criminal underworld stuff.
user2: Does it feature so hot chicks?
user1: Only in memory, I think. The main character's wife has recently died so sort of a missing woman trope.
user1: Oh, and by the way, she's the one who gave him the puppy.
user2: So he's actualy mad that the memory of his hot wife died with the cute puppy so he is out to kill the russians
user1: I couldn't have summed it up better myself.
user1: So, basically it's a bunch of action movie tropes all rolled into one featuring Keanu Reaves. I can't recommend it!
user2: its a great netflix and chill movie if you dont actualy plan on watching the movie.
user1: Could be but it's pretty violent and grim.
user2: Loud enough to drown out any noises so your room mates or kids dont know whats going on

conversation:
user2: what kind of movie is this ?
user2: hello.... 
user2: you there ?
user2: are you reply about this movie ? plz
user2: how you feel about action block in this movie ?
user1: This movie is an Action movie, starring Keanu Reeves. 
user2: so nice ... to hear .. i too seen this . how you feel about action block in this movie ?
user1: The action in this movie is full of movement and has a lot of "knock your socks" off moments. 
user2: wow. so it is amazing to watch this movie 
user2: /
user1: How do you feel about him seeking vengeance for his car and the murder of his dog that his deceased wife got him?
user2: I felt very shock on that moments., 
user2: Ahh.., Then how you feel about that moment ?
user1: As an ex-hitman I bet he was a large target for many different people.
user2: no need to bet .. yes you right said.
user1: I wonder why only Chad Stahelski was credited as directing the film and they didn't include Leitch?
user2: think he may need full credit..
user2: what you feel ?
user1: It says they both directed it together but only one of them got credit for it, that seems unfair to me.
user2: no may be leitch not like to mention name on that 
user1: I see that John Wick got the nickname "Baba Yaga", I wonder what the meaning of that name is and how he came into it. What do you think?
user2: Yoga is the mean of exercise for health including mind..
user2: May be in India there is a person who named baba yoga.
user2: so he used this name
user1: It says Yaga, not Yoga. I wonder what Yaga means?
user2: oh sorry.
user1: That's okay.
user2: i thought it yoga
user2: yaga is also traditional thing
user2: it is a part of Hinduism. like prayer  
user1: It was awesome that Aurelio punched Losef because he brought him John's stolen car. I think it's nice that he had his back and told John about him coming to the shop with his stolen car.
user2: also he travels to the little russia church.
user1: I would not want to go in the Red Circle and try to get Losef back, that would be scary to have to fight all those people.
user1: That also explains why he had to retreat back to his hotel to take care of all of his injuries.
user2: Yes. and also knocks 
user2: why he is planning to escape ?
user1: If Ms. Perkins never would of tried to break into his hotel room to kill him they never would of got that information they needed to find Viggo's front.
user1: He has to escape or they will kill him.
user2: oh .. that is very super situation.
user2: and you seen that when he pulls knife what happened ?

conversation:
user2: Did you like the movie?
user1: I never saw the movie
user1: Did you?
user2: Oh ok. I did - loved it. 
user2: I didn't expect to like it at all.
user1: I actually have the DVD.  Got it as a gift, never watched it.  Now that I read about it, I think i might
user2: Yeah - it is pretty good. we have the sequal as well and have watched it a number of times
user1: I didnt even know it had Keanu in it
user1: Are they all called John Wick
user2: yeah - John Wick one and two
user2: I think the document just changed? If so - talking about that car is a huge thing.
user2: He really cares about his dead wife, dead puppy, and his car.
user1: I see it.
user1: I still cant believe his puppy dies
user2: sounds silly in a way, but it works. 
user1: Baba Yaga - what a nickname
user2: yeah - the puppy was a gift from his wife that arrived after she died - don't worry not a spoiler.
user2: lol yeah 
user2: The hotel that it mentions - the Continental - it might as well be a character itself
user1: John "kills his way to losef" is quite the image
user2: it is a spot on description that. 
user1: hahaha
user2: you know, over the top, but in an action movie good way.
user1: Oh! The continental is a hotel! I assumed a car
user2: oh lol - yeah. It is like a hotel for criminals.
user2: they even have their own special currency.
user1: He got a new puppy!
user2: yep! lol
user2: now I want to rewatch it. 
user1: Was the first one also a Pit Bull?
user2: no...i can't remember what it was.
user2: but not a pit
user1: This movie has everything.  Helicopters, puppies, guns, russians, etc.
user2: yep and don't forget the church.
user1: yes.... the church
user2: oh and when he is killing his way to this guy - it is like a russian bath house under a night club
user1: Was the sequel just as good?
user2: yeah - i didn't see how it could be, but surprisingly, it worked.
user1: Russian bath houses just sets the cherry on top
user1: It's called an American neo-noir action thriller.  What exactly is that?
user1: New dark?
user2: yeah - noir was originally big in the 40s ish
user2: but this is very modern american with a dark underworld  edge
user2: the second one takes place  in Italy.
user1: Never heard the term.  Any other things overly good about it?
user1: Ok. good
user2: I think the supporting characters are really well developed
user2: like the management at the hotel and the front desk clerk
user1: The other names dont ring a bell right off, but I'm sure Ive had to see some of them before
user2: the manager was in Deadwood if you ever watched that
user1: I did.  like 2 years ago
user2: he was the owner of the saloon
user1: ok
user2: isn't there supposed to be a second document coming up?
user1: I thought so
user1: The document did change 3 times
user2: ok. making sure I read that right
user1: change twice
user1: It just got longer
user2: yeah - just thought there was a second one for another movie or something.
user1: Maybe we have to hit finish.  It was nice talking to you

user1: You should definitely check out John Wick! Have you heard anything about it?
user1: Yes, I do too! :) 
user2: Yes! I know I've heard about it but never actually seen it!
user1: Keanu Reeves is great in it! He plays an ex hitman who comes back from retirement after the death of his wife. 
user1: There are alot of really great action sequences in it! 
user2: Oh ok ok that sounds good, I'm aware that Keanu Reeves is the main actor on it but no idea whats the plot of it.
user2: So what year is this movie based like on the present, or more futuristic?
user1: It was made in 2014. Definitely not futuristic. 
user1: Basically he comes back from retirement to seek vengeance after his vintage car was stolen and his puppy was killed. :( 
user2: Yeah well I mean within the movie, when and wheredoes the story take place?
user2: Oh ok ok what kind of Vintage Car was it are you able to recognize it?
user1: It's set in the present in New York
user2: Oh ok ok
user2: So from who is he seeking vengance, who are the bad guys?
user1: I believe it was a Mustang
user1: They're Russian mob
user2: Oh ok, well he must have a hard time going against the Russian Mob. What about the dog what kind of dog was it?
user1: He was pretty much the best assassin and had quite the reputation. I'm not sure the breed, I just know it was a puppy that was a final gift from his deceased wife.
user2: oh ok ok well I guess I'll have to watch it then! I've seen advertised the sequels of this movie, part 2 and I've heard there is going to be even a part 3, do you know something about that?
user1: I've heard that it is a series, but don't really know anything about the other movies. 
user1: But, I'd definitely see them if they're anything like the first movie! 
user2: Nice you are really selling it! So do you know if this story is based in a written novel?
user1: I didn't know that! But, I love to read so I will definitely look into it! 
user2: I was asking you about it! Is the movie based on a novel or not :) But just noticed you're not sure.
user1: Oh, sorry! I misunderstood. 
user1: It would make a great book though since it has such a complex story.
user2: So I just did a little reasearch and it is not based on a novel it's just created out of the movie's directors & team.
user1: Cool! Do you research reviews and ratings before watching movies?
user2: Not always just sometimes
user1: Well, this one got an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes! I think that's pretty great since they tend to be a little on the critical side.
user1: Do you think you'll watch John Wick?
user2: Yes for sure!
user1: Awesome! It was great chatting with you! 

conversation:
user1: Hello. Could you tell me the name of the movie? 
user2: Hello. Are you familiar with the movie John Wick?
user2: Its John Wick
user1: Yes, I've heard about the movie before
user1: Could you tell me when it was released? 
user2: It was released year 2014 and got 86 percent in Rotten Tomatoes
user1: That's pretty good
user2: I think so too. Main actor is Keanu Reeves
user1: Keanu Reeves is in it, right? 
user1: Oh yeah. I like him, he is a good actor
user2: That's right!
user1: Have you seen this movie? 
user2: Yes. It is pretty interesting. He did an good job portraying the role 
user1: What kind of movie is it? 
user2: action movie. He is trying to get revenge for the death of his wife
user1: Ha, classic. 
user1: Are there any good reviews for it? 
user2: Yep. It is directed by Chad Stahelski
user1: I've never heard of this director
user2: Yes. Some critic said that it is a ferocious movie and they can't get enough of it
user2: I am not familiar with the director too but this movie is pretty good. 
user1: I've heard there is a sequel. Did you see that one? 
user2: I haven't but probably will in the future
user1: Nice. Are you a fan of Keanu? 
user2: Yes! I just love his face lol
user1: Haha yeah he is definitely an attractive man
user2: Do you like action movie?
user1: Uum, it's not my favorite genre, but I tend to watch the ones that have good reviews. How about you? 
user2: Not crazy about them but if I like the actor I'll watch it. It is a great comeback movie for him
user1: Sounds good. Are there any other famous actors in this? 
user2: Michael Nyqvist if you heard of him before
user2: Alfie Allen too
user1: No, I haven't unfortunately. Still, it sounds like a nice movie. I think I have enough to make my decision, thank you

conversation:
user2: Pretty good actors in this film
user2: Wouldn't you agree?
user1: Yes I think so too. For an action movie it received pretty good scores.
user2: Agreed, those scores are pretty good averaging a B
user1: As you mentioned previously, Keanu Reeves is one of my favorite actors.
user2: Certainly, and the synopsis for the movie sounds really good
user2: However, seeking vengeance for a car and a puppy isn't very motivating to me
user2: how about you
user1: The car, no. The puppy, Yes! Reeves is good in these type movies. I read he is an ex-hitman in this movie.
user2: Maybe if someone killed his wife then it would make more sense to me, here she is recently deceased not murdered
user2: Pets do matter but I'm not going to go hitman on people for it
user2: Reeves is very good at these types of movies
user1: True. I think the overall theme is vengeance.  I find it difficult to comprehend that this is going to be a movies with several sequels.
user1: It also appears to be a quite violent movie.
user2: You're right the plot in my opinion could have been much deeper. 
user1: Yes I agree. This movie seems to also have a theme of taking human life without any regard of value. Since he is an ex assassin and his hits are spoken of freely in the movie. Not really what I would want to watch to relax.
user2: Yeah, I agree I don't like watching very violent movies
user2: Mostly films that are clever and with action, not just blood and gore and senseless actions scenes
user2: However, the scene about John Wick assassinating to marry Helen, sounds interesting
user1: I agree. Sounds like he did it because he was in love and wanted to get out of the business.  I think that scene alone might have made for a better movie and would have appealed to me more.
user1: It seems the action scenes are really well done.
user2: That should have been the general plot in my opinion not vengeance for a car.
user2: Wow he killed everybody to get to Losef
user2: So Losef becomes a central character because he stole a car and gets killed
user1: It sounds like he is well connected since people always let he know what is going on before someone gets to him.
user2: Yes, it does indeed.
user2: Characters actions have to make sense to me and this one doesn't. How about you
user1: I agree. It does not much resemble real life. Everyone around John protects him, helps him or allows him to escape so that ultimately he gets losef, his arch enemy. Not real life.
user2: Even Losef dad turned on him
user1: Everyone he goes after or attacks-falls. Including Viggo.
user2: That ending though lol
user1: Even when John is stabbed in the scene with Viggo, it says he "allowed" himself to be stabbed. Then again, he defeats a great enemy viggo. Yeah, it is kind of cheesy.  All wrapped up in a bow for us.
user2: Including going to animal clinic and getting a dog
user2: And wounded 
user1: Yes. That is the cherry on top of this mess of movie. Going to the animal clinic to get stitched up. 
user1: and his date place with helen.
user2: I don't understand how a supposed super villain could just stop fighting and be so surprised by Johns actions that he himself is killed
user2: I never heard of an animal clinic stitching people up
user2: I would not want to see this movie
user1: As written earlier. John Wick the movie was not a believable story and I don't think I would want to watch it either. 
user1: Thank you for chatting with me about this movie.
user2: Flawed plot, unbelievable, and senseless killing sprees
user2: You're welcome
user2: Nice chatting

conversation:
user1: This movie was excellent
user2: I haven't seen it, but it sounds action packed.
user2: Testing...

conversation:
user1: This sounds like a good action movie based on it being Keanu Reeves alone.
user2: It was a great movie.  I think my favorite part is that it all starts over them killing his dog! 
user1: Yeah; Sounds amazing. Are you familiar with any of the other actors listed in the document?
user2: I don't believe I am.  Though I suspect they have been in other films and I just didn't recognize them.  
user1: Same here. I know you've seen the movie, so did they mention how his wife died in the movie or show it happening?
user2: I think she died of cancer if I recall.  It was some illness.  Her dying act was to give him the dog, which the bad guys killed, so he wouldn't be alone.
user1: Oh wow. I'm gonna try to watch it this weekend.
user1: Do you believe that the Rotten Tomatoes scores are accurate for most movies?
user2: I think they are, but sometimes I find I have different tastes than the critics or general viewing audience. 
user2: I thought another document was supposed to load after our 3 rounds each?
user1: That's kinda why I asked because a lot of times I don't agree with them
user1: I thought so too
user1: There is goes lol
user2: Mine just loaded
user2: yeah
user1: I'm reading about Joseph taking a Mustang to a chop shop. I know I already said it, but this movie sounds too good
user2: It is really good!  I liked it a lot.  The scene they are talking about was hilarious.  The mob boss's son gets punched by this guy.  The guy gets called in by the mob boss who is basically going to kill him for hitting his son.  He asks "Why did you do it".  The guy replies "It's John Wick's Car."  The mob boss says "Oh" and lets him go.  He then calls his son in and screams at him.  Haha
user1: LOL I'm not even a big movie fan but this has my full attention. 
user1: I have never head of the director (Chad Stahelski) before but I'll be sure to see what other movies he's made
user2: The new plot thread they mention is just relaying the revenge quest he goes on.
user1: I was just skimming over that part. This man is going in clubs, killing everyone lol (not funny, but the concept in the movie is)
user2: They funny part is he was retired.  That's a big theme in it and the sequel.  He didn't want to mess with anyone.  They dragged him back in by breaking into his house and killing his dog.
user1: Very, very interesting. So there's already a sequel and I haven't even seen the first one? smh
user2: Yep, called "John Wick 2" unsurprisingly. 
user1: Thanks. I'll be looking for that one this weekend too.
user1: I see the article talking about "Little Russia" church which serves as a front...they're doing a little bit of everything in this movie
user2: The next paragraph they gave us here is just more plot.  One thing it talks about, but doesn't elaborate on, is the Continental's rules.  That's a pretty funny highlight in both movies.  It's this hotel where all the assassins go that is neutral ground.  No killing inside the hotel.  Punishable, as they mention, by death.  
user2: Well the mob is a Russian mob, so it tends to have Russian elements woven in.
user1: I appreciate that. Good information.
user1: Oh; My bad for not catching on to that
user2: With regards to the Hotel's rules.  There are several times enemies meet in there, and hostilities instantly stop.... because if they don't... it goes very bad for the offending party.. haha  So they have these very polite friendly conversations inside the hotel between enemies.  It's kind of comical.
user1: Lol a lot of what I'm reading is making me chuckle so yeah, I see there's some comedy element to it.
user1: I also see that had to throw in the emotional parts in the movie like when he's walking home on the boardwalk where he had his last date with his wife
user1: they had*
user2: Right.  Also, picking out a replacement dog.
user2: The story opens with them killing his dog, and ends with him picking out a new one, once business was taken care of.
user2: You should youtube "john wick trailer" ;-)
user1: That's crazy, but a great intro and outro. 
user1: I'm going to pull it up in a few minutes on my phone

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi
user1: I haven't seen this movie yet.
user2: Which movie?
user1: I have a document up for John Wick.  do you have it too?
user2: No. You're supposed to try and convince me of watching the movie using the document.
user1: ah.  whoops.  i did this task once before, but it had different instructions.
user2: No worries. So what's interesting about the movie?
user1: it's one of those stories about a former hitman who's forced back into the "game"
user1: reviews are good, if that matters to you.
user1: 86% on rotten tomatoes
user2: Sometimes reviews matter to me, especially if they are about a movie of a genre I don't like.
user1: how do you feel about the hitman genre?
user2: I don't really care for action movies and I even less for hitman action movies,
user1: this one has a unique angle, it seems.  the hitman is out to avenge the death of his puppy.
user1: still there?
user1: ok.  i'm going to assume you signed off or something and am using the "abort" button.

conversation:
user2: Keanu Reeves did a really great job in the movie John Wick, don't you think so?
user1: I do think so.  I think this was the perfect role for him.
user2: I believe this was the first installment for the movie series.
user1: Yes and it had very good reviews which is probably why they made another.
user1: I think it is an interesting story line having John Wick be a retired hitman
user2: Yes a Rotten Tomatoes score of 86% is really good! Do you remember who played the head of the Tarasov family?
user1: I believe it was Michael Nyqvist
user2: Yes it is, and trying to get revenge for them stealing his car and killing his puppy. That is so sad.
user1: Very sad, you can feel his pain and anger in the movie.  He does a great job portraying the pain and anger.
user1: Do you remember who Adrianne Palicki plays? 
user2: Yes he does, Keanu Reeves is a very talented actor. I believe this was his first movie of this genre in some time and he really performed.
user2: I believe she plays Ms. Perkins, a contract killer.
user2: Do you remember when the car gets taken to the chop shop?
user1: I do, that was an intense scene.  What was your favorite part about it?
user2: I enjoyed watching Aurelio recognize the car and punching Iosef and throwing him out. That was awesome!
user2: Do you remember what John Wicks nickname was as an assassin?
user1: I think it was Baba Yaga
user1: Do you remember who was the head of the Tarasov family
user2: Viggo I believe was the head of the Tarasov family. Didn't he have a son also? 
user1: Yes his son was losef
user2: I loved the scene where John goes to that nightclub and takes everyone out to get to Iosef. Do you remember the name of the nightclub?
user1: Yes that was a good scene.  I liked the suspense of it.  All the action of him trying to get to losef but then Kirill allows losef to escape
user2: Yes. I just remembered the name of the club was Red Circle. What an odd name for a night club
user1: That is an odd name.  Do you remember the scene where he goes the Little Russia church (also a weird name)
user2: I really liked the fact that Marcus kept helping John throughout the movie. He was always there to assist and save John. 
user2: It was so sad that Marcus died in the end, that torture scene was instense!
user1: I agree it was very sad!  John already had lost so much and then loses him too
user2: I did like that Perkins ended up being killed for her breaking the rules though.
user1: I liked the scene where John and Viggo are on the dock fighting
user2: Do you remember what breed of dog it was that John ends up taking from that clinic at the end?
user1: I think it was a pit bull puppy. It was so cute!
user2: Yes that scene was very good! 
user1: I like that they added John and that dog meeting being that he lost his dog
user2: Yes it was. He saved that poor puppy from being put down. I think in the end he saved the dog and the dog saved him as well. That ending scene with him and the dog in the spot where he and his wife had their last date, so sad.
user1: It is so sad and sweet as well.  It shows how special dogs are and how much they can help during hard times
user1: Do you remember what year this movie came out
user2: This is true. It's no wonder the movie had such good reviews. A metacritic Score of 68/100 was a bit low I thought, but that's just my opinion.
user2: I believe it was 2014.
user1: I agree it was a bit low.  Although I do pay attention to critic reviews a lot of the time I do not agree with them.  There have been many movies with bad reviews that I thought were good
user2: Kind of messed up that only Chad Stahelski got credit for directing the movie even though he was assisted by another guy. Do you remember his name? 
user2: Exactly! The critics aren't always right.
user1: I think the other director is David Leitch
user2: Yes that was his name! Thanks I couldn't remember it at all.
user2: I think this was considered a neo-noir action thriller correct?

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi! Have you seen the movie John Wick. It's great!
user2: No I haven't.
user1: You really should! It stars Keanu Reeves. He's such a great action star, don't you think?
user2: He's a great actor for sure. Have you seen Thor?
user1: Not yet. I missed it in the theater but I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
user2: That should be very soon. They've been playing the first one a lot on cable. That's a great movie too.
user1: I really enjoyed it. Loki is just stellar. What is that actors name? Tom something....
user2: It's crazy because that's my first time ever seeing him in a movie. I'm not familiar with him at all.
user2: I didn't even know his first name..
user1: Tom Middle-something-or-other. He recently played Hank Williams.
user2: What other movies have you seen recently?
user1: Aren't we supposed to be talking about specific movies?
user2: Got it. Sure.
user1: What was yours?
user1: I got John Wick, and to be honest I didn't really like it. Kinda dumb.
user2: Hmmm...I don't really watch movies like that. I did see Jumanji though
user2: Jack Black happens to be one of my favs.
user1: He is hilarious. I wondered about that movie.
user1: I really like the original with Robin Williams, so I was a little skeptical.
user2: It was good, not great though
user2: Oh yeah, that one was good too
user1: I'll have to check it out. That was an Amazon movie wasnt' it...the new one.
user2: I'm not sure
user1: I think so. So I'll be able to stream it soon enough.
user2: If you want to get a good laugh. That's definitely the movie to watch.
user2: Yes for sure.
user1: Cool. How was The Rock in it?
user2: He was good. As usual though
user1: No doubt! My daughter has watch Moanna about a million times.
user1: She calls it Maui. Ha!
user2: I can only imagine. So she loves it?
user1: Never to young to like Duane Johnson I guess.
user2: Right, I would agree..

conversation:
user2: Hi
user2: Are you there?
user1: Hi yes
user2: What's the name of the movie?
user1: John Wick is a great movie if you like Keanu Reeves. It's high action, face paced and fun. 
user2: What's the plot about?
user1: He's an ex-hitman who gets pulled back into the world he escaped when bad guys steal his car
user1: and
user1: kill his puppy
user1: the last gift from his recently deceased wife.
user1: you can imagine, he's pretty wound up
user2: How much action is there?
user1: There's lots of action. 
user1: When you watch the movie, you'll see his vintage car gets a good outing
user2: How is the cinemotagraphy
user1: The reviews all think it's pretty stylish 
user2: How long is thie movie?
user1: I'm not sure but i think with such fast paced action, it'll seem really fast
user1: are you a fan of action / revenge films?
user2: It sounds like a good movie! I like I Spit On Your Grave
user2: Are there any other known actors besides Keanu Reeves in John Wick?
user1: Michael Nvqvist is the crime boss, Alfie Allen is his deabeat, useless son
user2: I don't know who those people are lol
user1: There 's a character called WInston who is the hitman hotel's owner 
user1: who is played by
user1: uh
user1: yeah I forget
user2: Have you seen the movie? how good is it in your opinion?
user1: There's lots of doublecrossing and bad people being bad. The scene where John destroys the russian church that the mob guy has as is front is epic.
user1: I loved it, i love action movies
user1: i thought the dog was the best and so cute. 
user1: spoiler... take a hankie
user2: I hate when animals die in films lol. 
user1: i think the rotten tomato rating is pretty worthwhile'
user2: is it cheesy? lol
user1: yeah it's very cheezy, but that doesn't stop it being excellent
user1: another spoiler 
user1: he goes home with a pit bull from the pound
user1: Keanu Reeves plays the whole thing pretty deadpan whilst causing meyhem and killing all the bad guys around him single handedly, what's not to like.
user2: sounds good as long as it isn't too cheesy
user1: I'm not sure what a 'neo-noir' action thriller is. But i know I want to see John Wick 2. 
user2: I think I want to see it!\
user1: that's great

conversation:
user2: Good afternoon.
user1: Hello
user2: You should really go see the movie John Wick. It is really funny and a lot of action!
user1: It looked good, but I haven't seen it yet
user2: I love Keanu Reeves in this style of movie. He is fantastic!
user2: He plays a retired hit man that comes back for revenge on the people that stole his car and killed his dog.
user1: He is a good actor
user1: That sounds like a good movie.
user2: I think he's good in action movies that are a little more tongue-in-cheek.
user2: Willem Dafoe is also in this movie and I don't think he ever made a bad one. Certainly not this one.
user2: This is also the first in a series so there is more to come.
user2: Do you like action movies?
user1: Love them
user1: Big fan of willem defoe
user1: He just changed his name though
user2: Plenty of vehicles getting trashed in this one.
user1: Love it!
user2: Keanu's nickname in the movie is "Baba Yaga" which is a little weird, but he's bad A.
user2: Any action movie involving the Russian Crime Syndicate gets my seal of approval.
user2: The movie also stars Adrianne Palicki as another contract killer. Very easy on the eyes.
user2: The only character I don't like is the son of the character Viggo played by Alfie Allen. He's an arrogant idiot.
user2: Do you usually pick movies on ratings?
user2: You still there?

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: hi
user2: I would like to recommend a movie to you called John Wick.
user1: Who is that
user2: John Wick is the lead protagonist in an action called John Wick
user2: He is played by Keanu Reeves.
user1: oh wow sounds cool. When did it come out
user2: It is a fast paced action thriller and it was released in 2014.
user2: It has gotten good reviews, averaging an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: any other good actors?
user2: Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen are also in it.
user2: And it is directed by Chad Stahelski.
user1: ok, why should I watch
user2: It is a super exiting and thrilling action movie.  I'll explain a little bit of the plot.
user1: please do
user2: John Wick is a retired hitman, who is one of the best hitman in a Russian crime syndicate in NYC.
user2: *was
user1: how many people has he killed
user2: You never find that out, but he was able to retire because he pulled off an "impossible task" given to him by his boss, which included many assassinations. 
user1: wow. sounds intense. what is his goal in this movie
user1: also, rotten tomatoes is unreliable, what was its IMDB rating
user2: Well, the movie starts off with you finding out that his wife recently died.  Before she passed, she bought him a puppy.
user1: puppy? what breed
user2: Not sure what the imdb score is, but the Metacritic score is 68/100 and the CinemaScore is a B.
user1: what breed of puppy is it
user2: I forget what breed, but anyway a member of the Russian syndicate steals John's car and kills the puppy in an act of rage.
user1: wow is this movie really violent?
user2: So the goal of John for the whole movie is to pretty much kill his was up to the top of the syndicate to get revenge.
user1: cool, is it on DVD
user2: It is quite violent indeed.  He kills a lot of people throughout, including most of the Russian boss's (Viggo) henchmen.
user2: I am not sure it is on DVD, but I would assume it is since it came out a couple of years ago.
user1: oh great, would you reccomend me watchinh?
user2: Yes for sure.  I don't want to ruin the ending, but lets just say it involved a fight between John and his boss.
user1: thanks

conversation:
user2: I really liked the fast pace of this movie, what did you think?
user1: Yeah, I thought it was great.
user2: Did you think Keanu Reeves did a good job portraying John Wick?
user1: Yes I did. This was a great role for him. He's a great actor if he gets the right role.
user2: I wasn't familiar with Adrianne Palicki before this film, were you?
user1: No, I wasn't familiar with the other actors besides Keanu. Were you?
user2: No, I hadn't heard of any of them. 
user1: Oh yeah, I guess I do know one of them, Willem Dafoe. Good actor.
user1: Do you agree with the score on rotten tomatoes or metacritic?
user2: Oh he was so far into the cast list, I didn't see. But you are right, he is very talented. I think I agree more with the metacritic score----it was a fun movie, but not something I'd need to see again and again. 
user2: I think the movie starts off fairly exciting----though initially I was worried it was going to be kind of stereotypical action movie
user1: Yeah, it was a very unique scenario, getting revenge over the killing of a puppy, definitely not stereotypical.
user2: I also can't remember right now why Wick was called Baba Yaga
user1: Yeah, I don't remember why either. Do you like revenge movies or action movies in general?
user2: I guess both----they are usually kind of the same thing. Do you think this could be a new franchise like James Bond or Bourne?
user1: Yeah, definitely. The criminal underworld and the Russian Crime Syndicate is really full of potential for lots of new stories and characters. I think it could be an entire universe like Star Wars or Star Trek.
user2: I really like that there was a female assassin---I know its a little bit of a tired trope at this point, but I still enjoy seeing it on screen. 
user1: Yes, I'd probably watch a movie about the female assassin too, if she was the main character.
user2: I agree! I think it would be great. This part of the movie recap reminds me how much violence there was in the film. 
user1: Yes, there was a lot of violence in the film. The action was great but personally I really enjoyed the world and the characters more. Even the bad guys like Viggo were very interesting characters. Did you like the action more than the character storylines?
user2: Probably the storylines, honestly. The violence and action is like a supporting character to me---not so terribly important to the movie, but something that kind of keeps it trucking along. 
user2: Did you ever think that Wick wouldn't make it?
user1: what do you mean? make it out alive at the end?
user2: Yes
user2: Also, was it over the top about the puppy in the end?
user1: Yes, I thought he would make it out alive, but only because he's the main character in a hollywood movie. I'd be pretty angry if he did die at the end or didn't get his revenge completed. I thought the puppy at the end was a good ending. It at least was a bright spot in a very violent movie. And he definitely needed to replace the dead puppy, haha.
user2: Yeah, you are probably right. What about the final action scene with Viggo? That was great!
user1: It was one of the most satisfying scenes I've seen recently!
user2: Yeah it was pretty awesome! I was bummed Perkins was killed, but I guess she had to go. 
user1: Yes, I think it does make it more realistic, and it gives more insight into all the rules and operations of the continental and how serious they take it. I was very interested in learning more about the Continental.
user2: Me too---I had never heard of it before the film. I think there could have been another movie centering around that. 

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Greetings, the movie we are talking about is John Wick
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: John Wick...I have not seen this movie 
user2: Sounds ;pretty interesting though
user1: I really think you would like it.
user2: I love fast paced action and adventure
user2: Who is the actor that plays the main character?
user1: Well, this is definitely right up your alley
user2: Oh, Keanu Reeves
user1: Keanu Reeves is the main star and the title character
user2: He is excellent in all the movies, loved the Matrix and his other ones...4
user1: this movie is a lot darker than the matrix and very intense with action
user2: I see that it is highly rated
user1: there's a sequel out already too
user1: they intend to make it a triology
user1: trilogy 
user2: wow! already! It's rated 7.3 I will definitely check this out!
user1: it's a very ferocious type of movie, it doesn't slow down much from start to finish
user2: That's better than watching all these movie about zombies and Apocalypse
user1: yeah, this one is all reality, although in an extreme situation
user2: I like that-fast-paced and action! I just watched the trailer, looks awesome!
user2: it is already out or will it be out this spring?
user1: it's already out now
user1: on dvd
user1: and so is the sequel
user2: I prefer DVD-can't recall the last time I went to the movies, better at home!
user1: Yeah, me too, I'm actually downloading most of my movies now.
user2: Yeap, from free sites or Netflix, tickets are way too much and you can't bring kids...
user1: well, I was going to rated R movies with my dad when I was 5 years old.
user1: So, maybe I've seen more than most.
user2: Me too! It wasn't like today, everyone freaks out about ratings...
user2: They won't let my 12 year old at school to watch Frozen because it might be too disturbing!
user1: Yeah, my kids love some of the old stuff, that they'd never get to see at school.
user1: really...Frozen?
user2: Yeap, imagine that!

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hello
user2: So the movie we are discussing is John Wick
user1: What is John Wick about?
user2: The story focuses on John Wick, a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the theft of his vintage car and the killing of his puppy.
user1: That sounds interesting.
user1: What actors are in the cast?
user2: Keanu Reeves plays John Wick.  Other stars include Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, and Adrianne Palicki
user1: That sounds like a star studded cast!
user2: Ha.
user1: So would the movie fall under the action genre? 
user2: The film scored well on rotten tomatoes with an 86%
user1: That's impressive. I'm even more interested since people seem to like the movie
user2: It seems to be pretty popular.  Has a cinemascore of B.
user1: What genre does this movie fall under?
user2: This is an action movie for sure
user1: Is this movie a one off or is it part of a series?
user2: It is listed as the first installment, so it is likely part of a series.
user1: I love series. It gives me something to look forward to. 
user1: What else do find interesting about John Wick?
user2: The movie takes place in New York and John Wick takes on the head of a Russian crime syndicate.
user2: The setting is perfect for the plot.
user1: That's cool. I live in New York so it will be interesting to see if I recognize any of the landscape.
user1: How does John Wick get entangled with the Russians?
user2: It appears they are the ones who stole his car and killed his puppy.
user2: Chad Stahelski is the director
user1: That poor puppy! Why did they do that?
user2: I am not very familiar with his work, but this film should gain him more attention.
user1: What other films has he worked on?
user2: Being a former hitman, it appears john has made a lot of enemies.
user1: That makes sense
user1: What other films has Chad Stahelski worked on?

conversation:
user1: I love action movies.  Keanu Reeves makes a really good hit man.
user1: I'm surprised that it's score on Rotten Tomatoes was only 6.9/10
user2: But CinemaScore gave it a B.
user2: Metacritic was even lower.
user1: That's true.  Did you realize Chad Stahelski directed this movie?
user2: Who is that?
user1: He was one of the directors of John Wick, the other one is David Leitch.
user2: Supposedly, David Leitch was not credited.
user1: It's hard to believe the movie starts with someone killing his puppy.
user2: I thought the same thing.
user1: This movie demonstrates Keanu Reeve's ability to use kinetic style movement that films really well.
user2: Works well in action flick like this.
user1: Did you know when the antagonist of the film steals Wick's car and takes it to a chop shop?
user2: Yeah, he needed a  new VIN number.
user1: Then when the guy running the shop finds out it's Wick's car he punches him in the face and kicks him out of his shop.
user2: "Baba Yaga". What a ridiculous nickname!
user2: Wonder if everyone will call Keanu "Baba Yaga" now.
user1: That is funny.  Wick was called that because he was the best assassin.
user2: Viggo wanted him out of the picture so he gave him an impossible assignment.
user1: I thought he didn't want him to retire so he gave him that task.
user2: Oh. that's right.
user1: I liked the part in the nightclub where he has to kill his way to losef, but then he escapes.
user1: Viggo's Henchman Kirill keeps getting in the way
user2: But then action doesn't let up and Ms. Perkins enters the picture.
user1: Perkins sneaks into John Wick's hotel room to try to kill him, but John knocks her unconscious and leaves her with another assassin.
user2: Spoiler alert - Kirill dies! No more problems from Kirill!
user1: Perkin later frees herself and kills Harry which is against the rules and she gets called into a meeting at the htoel and is executed for breaking the Continental's rules. 
user2: Yeah, she dies, too.
user2: There is another puppy in this film, you know. John loves puppies!
user1: He must love puppies!  

conversation:
user2: I loved the movie John Wick. Have you heard of it?
user2: It is a movie starring Keanu Reeves. He is an ex hitman.
user1: Yes, I've heard it's very popular.  What did you like about it?
user2: It is a great crime movie about revenge. His car was stolen and his puppy was killed.
user2: Critics say it is like a B movie but maintains the hollywood feel.
user2: It got a 86 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes which is pretty decent. 
user1: Is it an action movie?
user2: It is an action movie but there are certain scenes which have some comedy in them.
user1: How long is the film?
user2: It is an hour and forty one minutes long.
user2: They call it a neo-noir action thriller.
user1: When was the movie released?
user2: It came out in 2014.
user1: So it's pretty violent
user1: What's the rating?
user2: It is violent. It got a metacritic score of 68/100.
user2: There is a scene where John, the main character interacts with the head of a Russian Crime Syndicate in New York City.
user1: what is the viewer rating? Is it appropriate for young teens?
user2: John was his best assasin, nicknamed Baba Yaga.
user2: I don't believe it is unless you want to expose someone to reality early.
user1: Keanu Reeves is great with martial arts. Are there martial arts scenes?
user2: Yes there is some mixed in there but it is mostly shooting. Very early in the film he is already killing everybody.
user1: Nice. He's fighting the Russian mafia?
user2: Yes. He is interrogating all these people and trying to find information. 
user1: Any romance? Or only love for the killed puppy
user2: No not really it is just action for the most part.
user1: Who directed the film?
user2: David Leitch directed it.
user1: He's one of my favorite action directors
user2: I forgot to tell you there is a fist fight where he fights the villain Viggo.
user1: Cool. I assume John wins?
user2: It was also directed by Stahelski.
user2: There are more movies. I believe there are three made so far. 
user2: He wins that fight though.
user2: He gets a dog in the end.
user1: What about the car?
user2: No he didn't find that yet.

conversation:
user2: Hello! What's the name of the movie?
user1: Hi, the movie is John Wick. Have you seen it?
user2: Yes, I've seen that one. What did you think of it?
user1: Well, I really like Keanu Reeves in most of his movies, so that was already a plus going in. But, I thought it was a pretty good action movie. What about you?
user2: I like Keanu Reeves too, and I understood why he felt the need for revenge. It was just a little too violent for my tastes.
user1: Yes, it was a bit violent. The killing of the puppy that was a gift from his deceased wife was especially upsetting to me, very sad.
user2: Yes, that part really sticks with me as well. Even when I've forgotten most of the parts of the plot, I remember that. :(
user1: Yes, same for me, that really stuck with me. I didn't care so much his vintage car was stolen, even if he apparently did lol. 
user2: Ah, yes, my husband was upset about the car! I'd forgotten all about it. :D I wouldn't care about the car either. 
user1: I don't know much about the director, Chad Stahelski, I haven't heard of him directing other movies but seems violent may be his style.
user2: I don't know anything about him... I saw the other day that there's a sequel to the movie. I was surprised there was anyone left for John Wick to kill. ;) :D
user1: True! His assassin nickname was an odd choice, "Baba Yaga". I have no idea exactly what it means, do you?
user2: I don't know what that means. My son had a book when he was little, called "Too Many Babas". I bet that's a different kind of Baba, though. ;)
user1: lol, I think you might be right. If you recall, the son (Losef) of the head of the Russian crime syndicate is the one that committed the theft, so sure he thought he would get away with it. 
user2: I didn't recall that.... I remember being intrigued at the idea of a Russian mafia... I had't known much about it before. 
user1: Yes, I felt that the actor that was the big man, Michael Nygvist (Viggo) did a good job portraying that role.
user2: I'm feel like I might want to watch the sequel, now that I've been reminded of some of the plot in the first movie.
user1: I think I will. I liked it when the woman assassin, Ms. Perkins, sneaked in Wick's room and tried to assassin him, but of course she failed.
user2: I don't even remember that! I think I will read a syopsis of the movie before watching the sequel. 
user1: I also could imagine it would be very difficult for the father Viggo to have to tell John Wick where his son was, knowing he was going to kill him!
user2: I imagine it would!! I am very protective of my son!
user1: Exactly! But, he was able to avenge his wife, since the puppy was what he had left of her.
user2: Yes, I feel like my husband would probably want to do the same in the circumstances, although he probably wouldn't try it!! 
user1: But, he did get a pit bull puppy at the end, that was going to be euthanized so that was sweet.
user2: Yes, what a sweet ending. :) 
user1: Oh, and he ended up killing Viggo, after he actually let him stab him! 
user1: You were right at the beginning though, it was pretty violent.
user1: Still there?
user1: It's been 10 minutes and there hasn't been a response so appears the other user has aborted the task, even though we were almost finished. I will have to abort conversation, as I don't know what else to do. My ID# A3NMQ3019X6YE0

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: hi!
user2: Did you like the movie?
user1: yes its one of my favorites
user1: did you enjoy it
user2: me too! I quite enjoy action/thrillers like this. I love that it's all about his car and puppy.
user1: keanu reeves done a great job 
user2: absolutely
user2: I definitely think he makes the character. I don't know that anyone else couldve brought John Wick to life like that.
user1: absolutely no one could have 
user2: haha I love "Baba yaga"
user2: the way they build up that character and present his legacy is great
user2: It's pretty cool that Aurelio won't chop the car because it's John's. And that Viggo gets upset that John is who is son went after. Like, they know you don't mess with this dude!
user1: after losing his wife its understand able that he would snap back into his hitman trait to take them out for killng his puppy
user2: definitely
user2: you really feel his pain too
user2: What do you think of the Mustang? 
user1: i like the part when the start playing if i was your vampire by marilyn manson it fit the scene perfectly
user2: I can't remember the music but I have no doubt
user2: I do remember that car though! Totally awesome
user1: ohi loved the part when he's driving it with the puppy
user2: totally
user1: or the bath house scene with viggos son
user2: Yeeeess
user1: or the hitman hotel 
user2: he's so smooth like killing his way to iosef
user2: its like nothing to him haha
user1: and paying eveything withgold coins 
user2: yeah all bad!
user2: i like the code of the continental and how they execute perkins for her betrayal
user2: Aaw that's such a soppy but nice ending too. He has a new pup and they walk down the boardwalk.
user1: yeah you dont kill on the continental grounds 
user2: yeah id forgot about that til now but i like it
user1: its been a while but i dont remember the board walk scene 
user2: I don't either really but its nice to read about haha
user2: john gets a happy ending after all his trouble
user2: i like the fight scenes like when he disarms and wounds viggo
user1: i know right i just glad he took out viggo 
user2: for sure
user2: and like he kills all those henchmen before he even gets to viggo
user2: would you pick out a pit bull puppy? 
user1:  yes it was the best action movie of 2014 ..i like the part where there talking about john wick killig all those guys with a pencil 
user1: i sure would lol
user2: totally!
user2: lol id pick out a pit bull too
user1: i hate that they killed marcus too

conversation:
user1: hello, John Wick got a great score on rotten tomatoes but kinda stumbled on meta critic
user2: I agreed and I think Metacritic Score could've done much better knowing that Rotten Tomatoes has been around for quite sometimes. 
user1: I really like the action in the movie and Keanu Reeves was terrific in it. 
user2: Keanu Reeves plays as an ex-hitman in this movie which he plays as an action hero in this movie. 
user1: Yea i really liked how he was going after the Russian crime factions, it gave it a sort of believable plot. 
user2: I think some of those critical responses are quite spectacular but I just don't understand why Metacritic Score gave such a low rating on this film. 
user1: Yea metacritic seems to low for John Wick. I think the critics were to hard on it while the audiences loved it. 
user2: I am not even sure if some individuals in Metacritic Score have seen the film. If so, there wouldn
user2: wouldn't been a huge gap between both websites.
user1: Yea thats true. Cinema Score gave it a B so it got at least some recognition. 
user2: In the top key scene number 1 tells us that John has a nickname by the name of "Baba Yaga'. 
user1: Haha yea thats a cool fact. I like that this movie has a ton of action and is never really waiting around for stuff to happen in it. 
user2: I haven't seen the movie but so far I think this film is about John Wick who used to work as a hitman and after getting out he is going back to get revenge on the death of his wife. 
user1: Yes, hes trying to get revenge for his wifes killers and there are in a Russian mafia family. 
user2: Losef is the son of Viggo which happens to be the head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York City. That's interesting because I thought the setting of the film took place else where. 
user1: Yes its kind of confusing because he is Russian but he lives in New York City. But i believe they go to other cities as the film progresses. 
user2: John is basically killing his way to get to losef but what's interesting is about Ms. Perkins. I wonder if she is his protagonist or antagonist in this film. 
user1: I believe she might be a bit of both sort of like a double agent in the film. 
user2: I don't like the fact that it took Viggo's life to find and finally kill losef. Viggo should've been the mean antagonist that is harder to find and destroy. 
user1: Yes i  agree, but John Wick kinda had to go through the whole family with underbosses to finally get to him.
user2: Losef was able to escape but momentarily killed at his safe house. I think this scene of the movie was a bit too vague. The director should've made it more interesting.
user1: Yea thats true but i think they wanted to leave it kind of vauge to make the movie more interesting because you wouldnt know if he could come back or not. 
user2: I think that is one reason why this film received such a low rating on Metacritic Score compared to Rotten Tomatoes because the ending was too vague. 
user1: That could be one of the reasons. Maybe the audience was confussed aboput what happened at the end and didnt like it because of that. 
user2: Also, I like how Keanu Reeves was able to star in this film as John Wick and I think he did a great job based on the given story line excluding the ending. 
user1: Yes i thought he was really good in the movie and did a great job acting in it.
user1: we should be able to finish the conversation now
user2: I don't like the fact that Ms. Perkins was killed in this film and I think to make it more interesting the director this film should've made Ms. Perkins some how fell in love with John giving him a new hope in life. 

conversation:
user1: Hi. I saw this movie recently, it was pretty good for an action thriller movie.
user1: it starred keanu reeves.
user2: I personally don't like these mafia type movies
user1: oh, too much criminal underworld dealings?
user2: Keanu Reeves is a really good actor though
user1: yeah; he plays john wick in this movie, an ex-human
user2: It's apparently violent too which I don't like either
user2: But that's just me 
user1: yeah; it's pretty fired up and ferocious. 
user2: It could be a great movie nonetheless
user1: there is some funny dialogue despite it being a thriller
user2: Why is it always Russians haha
user1: russian crime syndicate in new york city, though. lol.
user2: Baba Yaga? 
user1: there is a lot of violence - punching and throwing, and implied assassinations
user2: That's a funny nickname haha
user1: oh yeah. expecially for an assassin
user1: i didn't even know new york city has a "little russia" - i guess that's in the movie, too
user2: And a church as hiding place? 
user2: God sees you though haha
user2: If you believe in him atleast,which they probably don't 
user1: lol. not sure if that's better or worse than the "safe house" where the guy gets killed.
user2: There's a little of every country in NY I guess lol
user2: Yea,not much of a safe house 
user1: viggo must have been a pretty bad guy with all of that blackmail material
user2: I mean it's a movie,but one guy killing hundreds of people?
user2: He's no saint for sure haha
user1: lots of torture before the execution sometimes, too
user2: Why are they always escaping by helicopters lol
user1: lol. can't be a good action movie without a helicopter!
user2: I guess so haha
user1: i love that there's a dog in this movie, but that puppy was the saddest part
user2: And some puppies apparently 
user1: yes
user1: pit bull puppy!
user2: Well he saved one at least at the end
user1: thankfully. he couldn't get his wife helen back but at least he got a new puppy.
user2: Yea,it's some kind of new start I guess
user1: talking about it now, i can see why it only got a 6.9/10. lol.  i did actually see it, though.
user2: It also sounds like a 6.9 lol
user1: it was nice to reeves return to action though

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: The movie we'll be discussing is John Wick, in which Keanu Reeves stars as an ex-hitman who goes on a path of destruction after assassins kill his dog.
user1: Interesting, is a new movie?
user2: No, it came out in 2014. Interestingly, Mr. Reeves did a majority of his own stunts for this movie and was deeply involved in learning firearms combat tactics.
user2: One of the reasons this film reviewed so well was it's attention to detail in the firearms combat scenes.
user1: Its a movie with purely action?
user2: Yes, it's definitely an action movie through and through.
user1: Does it have other famous actors?
user2: Not really, a few lesser known names like Michael Nyqvist.
user1: Has it won any awards?
user2: The film currently holds a 86% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.9/10
user2: It has not.
user1: What is the duration of the movie?
user2: It's really one of the more innovative action films to come out in years. I don't have numbers for the duration, but I'd guess about 100 minutes.
user2: If you enjoy well-choreographed action scenes, I'd definitely recommend it.
user1: Can you tell me a movie similar to this one?
user2: You might be interested in the Korean film "Oldboy", which has similarly well-choreographed fight scenes.
user2: And while it's not really similar or in the same genre, I'd definitely recommend "Kung-fu Hustle", one of the funniest and best films to come out of China in some time.
user1: Does John Wick have gore scenes?
user2: No, although you do see people get shot and the movie in general is quite violent, I wouldn't say it's very gory at all.
user1: Does it have a sequel?
user2: It does, John Wick 2 was released just last year, although I haven't seen it yet.
user1: It has scenes in many countries or just one?
user2: Hmmm, hard to remember; most of the movies takes place in America.
user1: Ok, I guess there's not trips during the movie. It involucrates mafia or gang groups?
user2: Yep, the mafia, although I'm not entirely sure what involucrate means, but it seems like a fun word!
user1: It is! It's like includes. John Wick is kind of a hero?
user2: I'd also recommend any films by Tarsem Singh, one of my favorite directors, he has a really unique visual style.
user2: Yes, he's the main protagonist of the film.
user2: It's probably one of the better action films to come out in the past few years.
user1: He has another mission, different than vengeance for the kill of his dog?
user2: Oh yeah, they stole his car too, the bastards!
user1: Does the film includes high tecnology such as robots or something related?
user2: It's at this point I begin to wonder at what point this will end?
user2: No, no robots, androids, or automatons.
user1: I started wondering it too, but it seems I can finish the conversation now
user2: Well, thats my time
user2: Thanks and have a great day!
user1: I'm interested of watching it, thanks to you!

conversation:
user2: HI! Seen any good movies lately?
user1: Actually, I just recently saw John Wick, the second one. What about you?
user2: Ah, Ive seen the first Jon Wick, but not the second.  How was it>
user1: I was not too fond of the second. The first one was amazing; the 2nd was way overdone
user1: I loved all of the drama and suspense in the first
user2: Really? There wasnt drama and suspense in the second one?
user1: There was, but it felt fake. It was TOO over the top. I think they should of left it alone after the first
user1: Keanu Reeves is amazing though
user2: Yeah, I dig Keanu.  What was the plot of the second?
user1: The bad guys in the first were not seeking revenge. Then there was a worldwide hit put out on him, and every single person who tried to take him out, John Wick killed. Awesome concept, but too much like a superhero type of a movie 
user2: Sounds like something I would like though.  Were there any other good actors in it?
user1: Ruby Rose, Ian McShane.. You should probably check it out to see.. I think they are making a 3rd one too
user2: I love Ruby Rose.  Does she make it til the end? Is she a good or bad guy?
user1: She was one of the bad guys, against him.. She did make it to the end but...... You won't be seeing her in the 3rd, haha
user2: Aww boo! I still think it sounds good.  Hate you didnt like it though.  I assume since theres a third being made that John makes it, though.  Are there some pretty gnarly fight scenes?
user1: The first one was directed by Chad Stahelski, he's a great director 
user1: Yeah the fight scenes in both movies are pretty amazing
user1: the effects in the 2nd are much more intense than the firs
user1: t
user2: Did he direct the second one also?
user1: Yes he did!
user1: I love the concept of the ex-hitman 
user1: I was so sad when his dog died in the original
user2: Nice! I hate it when different directors do the second movie.  It never has the same feel.  Does John get a love interest in the movie>
user1: Yes he did! :)
user2: Oh yeah.  I hated the dog dying :(
user2: Aww good! I didn't like seeing him so sad
user1: I know. He's a good guy at heart
user1: with bad on the outside, haha
user2: So there was a hit put out on him just because he got out of the hitman business?
user2: Yeah totally!
user1: Yes he wanted to retire, and I don't think they liked that so much. They needed him
user1: No one is better than John Wick! haha
user2: As much as the world could NEED a hitman....lol
user1: Thats the truth, lol!
user2: It sounds like an interesting take.  Almost like a gang affiliation where youre in for lfe and the only way to get out is death.  
user1: I think in the first one, his wife died, which made him turn into something more evil
user1: yes thats a really good analysis of it

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hi
user1: Have you seen John Wick?
user1: I saw it but I don't remember much.
user2:  No, I haven't.
user2: It seems interesting. I like that Keanu Reeves is the main character.
user1: I don't blame him for trying to get back at whoever killed his wife.
user1: Yeah. He's a great actor, and a great person outside of film.
user2: The plot is definitely different compared to other movies. It must be a good movie considering the rating on Rotten Tomatoes. They can be pretty harsh.
user2: Do you recognize any of the actors/actresses besides Keanu Reeves?
user1: I agree. That's a good rating.
user1: No. I'm not big into action movies. I have Constantine playing right now with Keanu.
user1: Sounds like some mob stuff is going on at this point.
user2: Oh okay. Yeah, the movie does seem violent but I'm not sure if it's rated PG-13 or PG-18.
user1: Probably rated r because of the violence.
user1: I wonder why they killed his wife.
user2: I agree. I don't know, It's also mentioned that someone killed his puppy, which was a gift from his wife.
user1: Maybe because of his past connection being a hitman
user2: Hmm... Losef stole John's car so maybe he was responsible for the killings too?
user1: Sounds like typical scene.
user2: Yeah, except that Losef is Viggo's son and John used to work for Viggo.
user1: I think they always let the goodguy live. 
user2: Yeah, John lives after being captured by Viggo. It's sad that Viggo gives up his son's location in order to stay alive.
user1: Some people don't have the best morals.
user2: Viggo is a perfect example of that. Overall, I feel that it's a great plot and I think I would enjoy seeing it as there's more to come in the later movies.
user1: I think there's a couple of the movies out 
user1: Seems John has a few reliable friends.
user2: Probably since this one was made in 2014. 
user1: Yeah.
user1: Sad ending, going back to the beach.
user2: Yeah, he even got a new puppy as well. At least not everything was killed.
user1: Yeah. Typical movie!
user2: I have to agree. John and Winston are the only people that survive, which are the non-evil characters.

user2: HI FRND
user2: NO
user1: me either
user1: I have heard of  Keanu Reeves tho.
user1: The rating score is pretty good for this movie as well. 
user2: ACTION MOIVES ARE ABOUT MOVEMENT AND john wick pursues that goal with remoresies verve
user2: yeah i like that movie
user2: which character would you like that movie
user2: hello
user1: I"m not sure I have not seen this movie, but it sounds really good and filled with action.
user2: ok
user2: what is your favourite movie
user1: My most favorite is Probably the first SAW movie
user2: ok
user1: Do you like Keanu Reeves?
user2: yes
user1: Me too I believe he was in the movie "Speed" from the late 90s too.
user1: I think I will need to rent this John Wick movie or see if it might be on Netflix.
user1: This document says there are some humorous parts as well. I like when they put comedy in action movies.  
user2: i too like action and comedy movies
user2: but my most favorite is action movies
user1: Me too. I pretty much like all types. 
user2: okey..
user1: It looks like a big part of this movie might be in Russia.
user1: Sounds like it also has a lot of cars too dealing with a chop shop
user2: yeah
user1: I do not know any of the other characters in this movie.
user2: me too
user1: I guess this is a series and there might be more than one. 
user2: how many movies go to per month
user1: at a theater not many, but sometimes i rent them once a month from video store. we have one video store left around here.
user2: do you like the hulk 
user1: I do. I think we have that on dvd.
user2: key
user2: okey
user1: The marvel comic movies my son really likes we probably own all of them.
user2: okey
user1: Do you see a lot of movies?

conversation:
user2: Have you seen John Wick?
user1: No i havent tell me about it
user2: It's a 2014 Action movie starring Keanu Reeves. It is a retired hitman who seek...

conversation:
user2: What did you think of the movie?
user1: I personally have not seen it, but it has a metacritic score of 68/100!
user1: What did you think?
user2: I was actually surprised by how much i liked it/
user1: I think Keanu Reeves is an amazing actor
user2: Super talented for sure.
user1: Although I'm not sure I know any of the other cast members who acted with him in this movie! 
user1: It's so sad about the puppy death
user2: The storyline for this movie was so farfetched yet they really pulled it off
user2: Anytime an animal dies it's a tear jerker.
user1: Yeah, it does seem a bit unrealistic though. Do you think people would actually seek vengeance over a puppy and stealing a car?
user2: You have to see the movie really to get it.
user2: It's a crazy plot.
user2: There's a swank hotel for all the hitmen that is kind of like a "safe" base.
user1: OH. Gotcha! What do you think about the humor in this movie? Are you generally a fan of action/violent movies?
user2: Dark, farfetched yet has humor to it.
user2: I never really go for action movies do you?
user2: By action I mean violent.
user2: The humor is super low key. 
user1: Not usually! I'm not sure I liked the humor of it. 
user2: I think there's over 50 people killed within the first 20 minutes of the movie. Super violent. Guns everywhere.
user1: And it ends with the same thing? With the "impossible task" given by Viggo?
user2: Well it leaves you with knowing there is going to be a sequal.
user2: sequel. Sorry spelling.
user1: Oh you're fine no worries!
user2: Do you think you are going to ever watch it or no?
user1: I think when John travels to Iosef's "safe house" to kill him, it really brings a good end to the story
user1: LOL probably not
user2: It definitely is one of those movies that are not loved by everyone.
user1: I think the amount of stabbing would probably bother people. I'm sure they do like the fact that John and the dog walk home on the boardwalk where he had his last date with Helen
user2: It's the shooting that is so crazy. More than half the movie is just shooting.
user2: Yeah he ends up with a new dog.
user1: Yeah, I can tell there is a lot of action from Keanu Reeves. It makes sense that some of the critical responses are that "some of us can't get enough of!"
user1: Do you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes rating of an 86%?
user2: I think I do agree! There is something about that movie that really works.
user1: I think we're allowed to finish the conversation now! It was great talking to you and thank you for sharing your insight on this movie! :)

user2: yeah its pretty high 
user1: Is there a John Wick 2?
user2: yes
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: yes whats your least favorite scene in this movie

user1: yours?
user2: probably the dog murder
user1: oh, don't remind me
user1: that's painful to watch
user2: yeah it had to hapen but it was sad
user1: I love animals so, that scene made me cry
user2: yeah it was rough but it made the revenge sweeter

user2: That´s what I heard. It has good reviews
user2: what did you liked most of this movie?
user1: The whole thing starts because his dog is killed. So that's sad but satisfying to see him get revenge. 
user2: I applaude that! a dog is an important part of the family! (at least for me jajajaja)
user1: hmm is the next paragraph supposed to appear now?
user2: I think so
user1: oh there we go
user1: the main bad actor is from game of thrones
user1: Alfie allen
user2: That´s Viggo carather?
user1: No it's his son
user2: character*
user1: John wick used to work for him
user1: and his son steals his car and kills his dog thinking he is a random guy
user2: for the description I´m reading there are lots of really action scenes!
user2: cars, helicopters and anything!
user2: I wonder is the movie had good lines too
user1: its kind of like the matrix with no slomo scenes and air fighting
user1: just crazy gun action
user2: because I can tell they were very carefull in the actions details of the film
user2: but in the Matrix there was deep content and memorable lines to
user1: HE is actually really good at shooting in real life
user1: oh yeah it also has willam defoe I think
user2: yes! I have seen behind sceens videos that show him shooting. It´s a proffesional
user2: what was the part played by Jhon Leguizamo?
user1: Yeah he is a mater at range shooting
user1: i'm not sure
user2: he is a good actor to. I like his work
user1: i only saw the movie once

user1: Yeah most likely
user2: is a long movie? some actions movies are just too long sometimes
user1: it gets a little bit long. it's liek a kung fu movie, he kills sooooo many people
user2: jajajajajajajaja 

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hi
user2: One of my favorite movies is John Wick. I'm a huge Keanu Reeves fan. 
user1: I loved Keanu Reeves when I was younger.  I don't know if I'd be interested in this type of movie though
user2: It's more of a B-movie type genre, but it has a modern edge. He's really evolved as he has gotten older. John Leguizamo is great in it also. 
user1: I guess it's a matter of being in the mood for Keanu's delivery
user1: I do like action though so maybe that powers it through
user2: That's definitely true. His deadpan humor style works really well in John Wick though. I'm really into action movies also and this movie really starts and ends with it. It catches your attention right away. 
user2: Are you a Willem Dafoe fan? He is in it also. 
user1: I read in the synopsis his puppy is killed.  I have a hard time with animals dying in films.  I do like William Dafoe.  
user1: It has gotten good reviews on rot
user1: Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Yeah, it did. Rotten Tomatoes is pretty good about giving accurate ratings. 
user2: One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Iosef takes a mustang to the chop shop to remove the VIN. 
user2: It has so many good actors in the movie. The cast is perfect. 
user1: I like that he got punched before getting thrown out of the shop
user2: Lol, that was pretty funny. 
user2: He was always in the middle of some sort of fight in that movie.
user2: I also like the whole mob storyline. I enjoy those types of movies. 
user1: What is your favorite mob style movie?
user1: John Wick sounds like a badass.  
user2: I honestly like them all. 
user2: He is. He was really trying to get out of the hitman lifestyle when he got pulled back in. One of the best scenes is when he went to the church as a Viggo's front and destroys everything. 
user1: Of course Viggo taunts him for thinking he could leave the lifestyle behind.
user2: Right, I think we all knew that wasn't going to happen though. I thought Ms. Perkins was a great character too. Female assassins always seem more vicious than the male ones in movies. 
user1: Women have to be more cunning
user1: John allows himself to be stabbed?
user1: He still manages to disarm and fatally wound Viggo
user2: Yes, it was really to throw Viggo off more than anything. 
user2: It worked too because he was able to kill Viggo
user1: I love that at the end he stops by the animal clinic and gets himself a new pitbull puppy!
user2: Me too. He deserved it for sure after everything that happened. I also love that he was able to have a last date with Helen. That was awesome. 
user2: It was a great because they had been through so much.
user1: Well I guess I'm gonna have to check it out now
user2: Yeah, it's definitely worth it. I am biased though because I love Keanu but it's still a great movie. 

conversation:
user1: Hello, have you seen John Wick before?
user2: yes i have very dark and heavy
user1: I think Keanu Reeves is a good actor.  This movie had me on the edge of my seat.
user2: yes me too but very dark and overdone wiht viloecne
user2: is the name of the movie John wick
user2: or did he have several john wick movies   i have seen but cant remember
user1: I think he had a good reason for seeking revenge.  The killing of the puppy his late wife gave him.
user1: John Wick is the name of the movie.  It is really good, but does have a lot of violence in it.
user2: right   love revves
user2: he is cool
user1: I love a good get revenge movie and this has it all.
user2: and uses his gun as a marchel arts weapon
user2: what more can you tell me about the plot
user1: How dumb can Losef be, taking Johns stolen car to the chop shop run by Aurelio, he recognized the car right off the bat.
user1: It is action all the way through.  The story line is what kept my attention.  You want him to get revenge.
user2: yes what is he getting the revenge for   as like what happend to him to make him that way
user1: I also like Ms. Perkins, she is the female contract killer in the underworld of assassins and knows John.
user2: she is fine
user1: He has a run in with the Russian Crime Syndicate. He is seeking revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his puppy his late wife gave to him.
user2: seems familar
user2: i think i have seen this one
user2: ah
user2: yes
user1: I am not sure how his wife died.
user2: oh
user2: well i am starting to remmeber this
user1: The director Chad Staheiski did a good job with this movie in my opinion.
user2: yep
user1: I like how he ends up killing Losef at his safe house.
user2: yes
user2: sounds very cool
user2: love it
user1: The fist fight at the dock with Viggo was intense.
user2: and how did it end
user1: John kills everyone.  he stops by a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and takes home a puppy that was going to be put down.
user2: is it a good ending
user2: ofcouse he does
user2: haha
user1: The last scene is him on the boardwalk where he and his late wife had their last date.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user2: Do you have a movie recomendation
user1: Yes, the movie I think you should see is John Wick. It star Keanu Reeves, and is a high octane action movie. Lots of shooting and practical car stunt work.
user2: What is the plot?
user1: The plot centers around the titular John Wick. He's an ex-assassin who has been trying to get out of the criminal underworld for a while. Mobsters come to get him, and kill his puppy. This sets John off on a full-on revenge story.
user2: Oh, I think I've seen trailers on it. Who else is in the cast?

conversation:
user2: Good afternoon!
user1: Hello!  The movie is John Wick and I totally think you should see it if you haven't
user2: What exactly is it about.
user2: I am unfamiliar with that movie.
user1: It's a neo-noire action thriller about a guy out for revenge
user2: Why does he want revenge?
user1: Some people steal his car and kill his puppy, which was a gift from his recently deceased wife.  It's a neat twist that really makes the film stand out over other action flicks
user2: That sounds like an interesting movie. What are some of the actors that play in it?
user1: Keanu Reeves plays the eponymous character, which means you know it's gonna have great martial arts as well as seriously well choreographed gun play.
user2: Is there romance in this movie?
user1: Well, his wife was recently deceased so he's not looking for anything serious.
user2: About how long is the movie?
user2: hello?

user1: Ah. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, haha
user1: Do you like Keanu Reeves?

user2: Yes I do
user1: yeah. I liked him in Bill and Ted.. haha. That's about it
user2: Do you want tp kn
user2: Do you want to know what I like about action movies?
user1: Sure
user2: Action movies are about movement, I know you dont like Keanu Reeves he makes John Wick pursue his goal with remorseless verve
user1: Haha that's fair.
user1: Action movies are kind of mindless, which I can be intosometimes
user1: It just seems repetitive sometimes
user2: I know he does kind of make it repetitive. I am a big fan of action comedies. 
user2: It did get an 86 percent on rptten 
user2: on rotten potatoes
user1: Yeah, I trust rotten tomatoes a lot of the time
user2: Which is bad for a movie. I do agree that Keanu Reeves can be a bit outdated
user1: Haha, just repetitive and unemotional to me
user2: Maybe they couldve gotten another actor. Either way the story line was engaging
user1: That's good to know. I don't think I recognize the other actors in the film
user2: So what kind of genres do you like?
user2: We have to do at least 3 conversations pertaining to the dialogue
user1: Hmm.. I like comedy. It's light and usually witty
user1: What's your favorite kind of comedy movie?

user1: yes
user1: I am a Keanu Reeves fan
user2: Me too
user1: and liked both parts of the movie
user2: Right, kind of crazy format, but good
user1: I am glad to see he performed the assassin role very well
user2: I agree, he was a good choice and performed well 
user1: Is there a part 3 planned?\
user2: I don't know, I hope so
user1: rotten tomatoes gave it a 6.9/10 
user2: do you like those ratings?
user1: I would give it an 8
user2: I sometimes do not agree with the ratings.
user1: I can't believe it was released in 2014
user1: I thought it was more recent
user2: What is your favorite genre?
user1: action 
user2: I like action, drama, and comedy?
user1: I liked the Matrix too
user2: YEs, good movie, really enjoyed it/
user1: yes I like a lot of different movies
user2: Do you go to the theaters?
user1: yes
user2: how often?
user1: every now and then
user2: It has been a long time for me.
user1: John wick was kind of confusing for me at first but then when it was over I really liked it
user2: Yes, interesting character. I like assasins
user1: I'm not sure if that's the only movie we are supposed to talk about
user1: but that's what the document I was reading was abou\
user2: Who were the other actors in the movie?
user1: alfie allen
user1: played the mobster
user1: I think he was he one who killed the pupp
user1: puppy
user2: I don't remember him. Strange hotel setting right?
user1: yea
user2: Who was the desk clerk?
user1: lance reddick
user1: it was nice chatting
user2: John wick was a good character, was it a book too?
user2: right, nice chatting with you
user1: I don't remember if it was a book
user1: have a good one

conversation:
user2: What is the movie about?
user1: Keanu Reaves is a hitman who kills a bunch of people, basically.  Because they killed his puppy. 
user1: It's got an 86% Rotten Tomatoes score, so that's pretty good.  
user2: Is it Point Break?  I haven't seen one of his movies in a long time.
user1: No, it's not point break.  It's newer, from 2014.   It's John Wick. 
user2: Who else is in it?
user1: Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Willen Dafoe, John Leguizamo, Ira McShane, Dean Winters, Bridget Moynahanm and Michael Nyqvist.  
user2: I have no idea who most of those people are honestly.  What is the plot besides killing over a dead puppy?
user1: Basically, John Wick used to be a hitman, but he retired.  Then someone made the mistake of killing his puppy, and he comes back for revenge.  It's a pretty simple vengence plot, not much to it.   It's a very distilled action movie. 
user2: Do you actually see the dog die?
user1: I don't think so.  
user2: I hope not.  I can't stand when animals get hurt on screen.  Humans?  KIll em all.  But animals are a big no.
user1: It mostly focuses on the action between the humans, yeah.  John Wick was basically the most badass assassin in the world before his retirement,   It's sort of a cartoonish world, where there's this entire underground culture of highly payed assassins. 
user2: What happens in the end?
user1: There's a big shoot out at a church, between John Wick and the mob boss he used to work for.  The mob boss gives up the location of his son, the one who had killed John's dog, and John kills goes there and kills him.  As I said, Distilled action movie, light on plot, big on shootouts.  
user2: Is there any humor?
user1: Not really. 
user2: Is it really bloody?
user1: It's not gory, but it's really violent.  
user2: Any kick ass women in it?
user1: Yep.  Adrianne Palicki played Ms. Perkins, an experienced contract killer.  She's sort of a villain in this, a rival to John.  
user2: Is there any romance?  I hope not.
user1: No romance at all.  John's wife died before the movie starts, the puppy was her last gift to him.  
user2: Aww, that's sad.  What is it rated?
user1: R. It's rated R for violence. 

conversation:
user1: What type of movie did you see?
user2: It's an action movie. John Wick
user1: Oh wow. Cool. The first or second one?
user2: First one. Keanue plays Jonathan who take revenge of his wife's death.
user1: Oh yeah. I actually saw that one. It was good.
user2: Yeah, it's one of my favorite action movie. I loved the character of Viggo.
user1: Viggo? I can't remember who that is. It's been awhile since I saw it.
user2: When he wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him impossible task that involved multiple assasinations
user1: Oh yeah. Now I remember. Is he the one that brings him that coin that's for repaying a debt?
user2: Yeah that's him.
user2: he was losef's father
user1: Yeah.I loved how Jonathan breaks out all his weapons under the floor.
user2: I loved last scene in particular when John ambushed them.
user1: Yes exactly! The dog incident is sad though.
user2: I agree, that was heartbreaking. Who was your favorite character?
user1: I guess I'd have to say the star..Keanu playing Jonathan. I like his bad ass performance.
user1: What about you?
user2: Yes, he was my second favorite character too. I liked Viggo acting
user1: Yeah. who played Viggo?
user2: specially that scene when he tortures Marcus before him in his home.
user2: before executing*
user1: Yes.
user2: I am not sure. I forgot his real name.
user1: Okay. Also Wick's car is cool.
user2: yes, it was very well designed.
user2: what about his dog?
user1: Yes and the scene in the "body shop". I couldn't believe the way they filmed that.
user1: What about his dog?
user2: when he got euthanized. that was heartbreaking
user1: Oh yeah for sure. Have you seen the sedcond one?
user1: second
user2: not yet
user2: it was pleasure talking to you. I must take my leave now.
user1: I think I have! I just can't remember. Well it's been nice talking. ye4s

user2: yes, but critics have always something to say
user1: do you think it was over the top?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gives it 6.9
user2: may be yes
user1: i think perhaps it is unrealistic
user2: based on hitman theme
user1: what do you think of the nickname they gav him
user2: I can't think about it
user1: why's that?
user2: john wick?
user1: they called him "Baba Yaga" 
user2: hmmm
user1: also do you think a dogs life warrants the killing of so many people
user2: have u seen during 2014
user2: or recently
user1: recently yes
user2: how did you like it?
user1: i enjoyed it, i know i would be very upset if someone killed my pet
user1: howabout you
user2: same for me
user1: what did you think of the ending?
user2: don't remember much
user2: it was good as they both went back
user1: do you think a sequel was a good idea
user2: may be
user2: lets finish conversation
user1: okay, nice talking to you about the movie

conversation:
user1: Hello. Have you seen John Wick?
user2: I have not.  What is it about?
user1: Keanu Reeves plays an ex-hitman that comes out of retirement.
user1: There is tons of action and it is very unique in the way that it is shot and edited. It's kind of hard to explain.
user2: Sounds interesting.  I haven't seen a lot of films with Keanu.  Do you know why he comes out of retirement?
user1: He has a score to settle with a Russian crime syndicate. 
user1: They killed his puppy.
user2: His puppy?!  That's awful!  Darn Russians!
user2: Is it a violent film?
user1: Very but its mostly hand-to-hand karate style fights but there are a lot of people that get shot. I don't remember if it was over the top but I don't think so.
user1: Do you typically like movies like that?
user2: Probably not.  I love action films, but I'm not big on violence or puppies being killed.  Plus, the last Keanu film I enjoyed was Speed, and that was over 20 years ago!
user2: Though I did enjoy the film Keanu, but that was a comedy about a kitten named after the actor.  ;)
user1: Ha, they don't show the puppy in this and I have seen that and its great.
user2: Who else stars in John Wick?  Any female characters in it?
user1: Yes, Adrianne Palicki plays a female contract killer, and Alfie Allen (GoT) plays a bad guy
user1: Reeves is pretty funny in it, it definitely has humor element thrown in and it is well done. They trash a lot of SUVs
user1: They also steal his car, I'm pretty sure it was a 70 Chevelle so he is a bit bitter.
user2: I can't picture Alfie Allen as a villain, but I do like Adrianne Palicki.  She was great in Agents of Shield, and she's in Orville right now.  She can hold her own against Keanu.
user2: Men and their cars. Hee hee.
user2: How long ago was the movie released?
user1: Yes, and of course he has to kill his way through 5 floors of baddies to get to the end boss. It was released in 2014.
user2: Five floors of fighting?!  Does he have anyone on his side?
user1: He does have some support, but he is pretty much a one man wrecking crew. I  would say border lining on superhero level
user2: One man wrecking crew...interesting.  
user2: Didn't this movie have a sequel released recently?
user1: I don't know about that. I do know that the first one set itself up for a franchise I think so I wouldn't be surprised.
user2: Everything seems to be a franchise lately, or a reboot, but if the story and universe is good, I won't complain about a sequel.
user1: I know that I enjoyed it and would watch a sequel for sure.
user1: I do like watching hand-to-hand style combat if it is done well.
user2: Keanu has lots of experience with that from the Matrix films, that's for sure!
user1: Yes, and this film reminds me of the Matrix but in a different universe and John Wick is definitely not Nemo
user2: Do you happen to remember the rating?  I wonder if it's too violent to have my teenage nephews watch it with me.
user1: I don't know for sure, but I would guess R.
user1: Alright, nice talking with you.

conversation:
user1: Hi, do you like action movies?
user2: yes which one
user1: Have you watched John Wick?
user2: no whos in it
user2: What is John Wick about?
user1: Keanu Reeves is John Wick Michael Nyqvist and Allie Allen are also in it.
user1: It is an neo-noir action thriller.  the sotry is about a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the theft of his vintace care and the killing of his puppy.
user1: Do you think you would like to watch it?
user2: maybe. Did you like the movie?
user1: I'm not sure I like action movies but it seems like a strange plot.   
user2: Yeah it does definitely sound like a strange plot.
user1: It gets 6.9 stars out of 10
user2: do you know who directed it?
user1: Chad Stahelski is the director.  Have you seen any other movies he has directed?
user2: no I've never heard of him before.
user1: It says that it was released in 2014.
user1: It is a B-movie.  Do you normally like those?
user2: Keanu is a really good actor so maybe even thought the plot is strange the movie might be good
user2: sometimes b movies are good 
user1: It says that John Wick is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of.
user2: maybe I will check it out just to see if it's any good
user1: It says that after a marked absence from the genre, Reeves resoundingly returns with an effortless, kinetic style that prositions the film extremly well for any potential follow ups. 
user1: Do you think it would be on Netflix?
user2: wow sounds like trying to make it sound good
user2: i dont know maybe netflix is always adding movies so its possible
user1: Yeah it sure does.  
user2: who else is in the movie 
user1: It says that some of the scenes are in a Russian church.  
user2: those churches probably look pretty cool.
user1: Adrianne Palicki, allie Allen, and Michael Nyqvist
user1: Do you know any of those actors?
user2: I have't heard of any of them
user2: thanks have a great day

conversation:
user1: Did you get to read a document yet?
user2: Yes I did
user1: Ahh okay... not sure exactly what we are supposed to do. I did not read one.
user2: I got one for 'John Wick', have you seen it?
user1: I have not but it sounds interesting, whats it about?
user2: It is about a hitman, who had left the life of killing behind, but after his wife died and his car got stolen by some Russian gangsters, he goes on the warpath
user1: Oh wow. Are there any notable actors/actresses in this movie?
user2: Keanu Reeves is the main character, which he really surprised me in this movie.
user1: The Matrix dude?! Thats cool. What time period is this movie set in?
user2: It seemed like right now
user1: Modern, even better.... has this movie won any awards?
user2: I do not believe so, films like this do not win awards usually
user1: Hmm I see. What genre would you consider this movie?
user2: Definitely action
user2: Lots of shooting
user1: Okay I actually want to watch this now!
user2: I recommend it
user2: The film has sort of a neo-noir quality to it
user1: Thats always great as a fan of the Matrix trilogy. Do you happen to know if there is a sequel to this movie as well?
user2: Yep, there is one, I believe it came out last year.
user2: It was really solid, as well
user1: Super cool, something that can captivate for longer than one movie is fantastic.
user2: It certainly does that
user1: I'm not sure what else we are supposed to do.... I am just waiting to be able to go look up this movie lol
user2: I do not want to spoil the details of it for you
user1: What rating does this movie have? Such as, PG 13, R, etc?
user2: I would think R, but it does not say on the document, at least where I can find it...
user1: Thanks so much for explaining all these details to me. I certainly feel like I know a lot about this movie now and know if I should spend my time viewing it.
user2: As I said earlier, I highly recommend it, and the sequel
user1: (how do we finish this task?)

conversation:
user2: I've never actually seen John Wick! I didn't know it had such high ratings!
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave John Wick and average of 6.9/10 so it is worth the watch.
user1: At least you stuck it out for a whopping 3 minutes

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Today we are going to talk about John Wick
user1: This movie was amazing. I love action movies. 
user2: So do I. 
user2: What did you like about it?
user1: I especially like action movies that have a mafia element. 
user2: Definitely! the russian mafia showed up}
user2: All because they killed Johns cat
user1: It was interesting to see John Leguizamo in this film. He's quite a character. 
user2: I really liked the cinematography too
user2: Oh yeah, I like him a lot
user2: Funny guy
user2: I really liked the effects and screenplay for its budget
user1: The back story was sad, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. 
user2: Oh yeah, but I mean, the movie is about revenge
user2: So you have to give it a sad bad story
user1: Right.
user2: I just watched part 2, and it kicks ass
user2: Loved it!
user1: Me too!
user1: Willem Dafoe was another good addition to the film. 
user1: I'm suprised that Metacritic only gave it a 68/100!
user2: Definitely! That is not cool. 
user1: When Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore gave it favorable marks. 
user2: I mean, its a lot of action but it is entertaining
user2: I would honestly give it a 90
user2: because it is fun
user2: never gets boring
user2: I mean, marvel hero movies dont have this much action
user1: Definitely. The action and wide range of cast really pushed it up there for me. 
user2: Yeah, I mean known actors having fun, you know
user2: it never feels forced
user1: The story is quite rich too. Interesting scenery. 
user2: Yeah! I loved that too, and the killers society with rules and protection was a unique touch too
user1: The violence was a bit gratuitous in parts. But it goes with the story I guess. 
user1: His Mustang was killer too. 
user1: Always nice to see cool cars in films. 
user2: Yeah, and I get why they did it, it was exaggerated on purpose
user2: Mustang was amazing
user2: murdered out so cool
user1: Fight scenes seemed very well choreographed. 
user2: The choreography was amazing
user2: and the music too
user1: The pit bull puppy that he rescued was adorable. 
user1: All around great film. Two Thumbs Up. 
user2: Loved that part! I think it was all well balanced
user2: Nice talking to you!
user2: Thank you.

conversation:
user1: Howdy
user2: Hi, how are you?
user1: Good!
user2: Have you seen this movie yet?
user1: I'm wondering if you've seen the movie John Wick?
user1: I haven't.
user1: But I really want to watch it.
user1: I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves
user2: No, I have not seen it, only the trailer but it looks really good!
user1: Yeah, I didn't think it could possibly be good
user2: Me too, he is a great actor, love his Matrix!
user1: haha me too
user1: But I was skeptical about this one
user1: because I thought they were just cashing in on him from the Matrix
user1: but apparently the critics really loved it
user2: Yes, it is rated very highly
user2: very fast-paced action!
user1: One critic said "John Wick is the kind of fired up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of"
user1: I guess that's what the trailers made it look like it'd be.
user1: But I was watching videos the other day
user1: Keanu Reeves trained for MONTHS for this movie
user2: I think they already made  another one of these 
user1: He was doing gun training and stunt practice so he could do all the stunts himself
user1: They did. Probably a testament to how solid this movie was
user2: Yes, he is very dramatic and it's amazing the he doe snot use a stunt man!
user1: Oh
user1: it also had Alfie Allen as one of the villains
user1: He's from Game of Thrones.
user2: I know, a great cast!
user1: And apparently the whole plot centers around the bad guys killing his dogh
user1: That's pretty hilarious.
user1: Sounds like it doesn't take itself too seriously.
user2: Can't wait to see it! When is it out?
user1: The sequel? 
user2: Yes
user1: Not sure, but this one came out in 2014
user1: I think the sequel already came out though
user2: I have to look it up, I want to watch both of them!
user1: Me too.
user1: It kind of sounds like the "Taken" franchise
user1: but instead of Liam Neason it's Keanu
user2: It will be a nice break from all these doom, boom and gloom Apocalypse/zombie movies!
user1: totally! I'm sick of all the overly dark stuff
user1: Oh interesting.
user1: Yeah the reviews actually predicted that this would be a movie franchise
user2: wow
user1: one of them says it "positions the film extemely well for any potential follow ups"
user1: Alright, I think we're done
user1: have a great day!
user2: YOu too, thanks!

conversation:
user2: Good evening. Have you seen this movie?
user1: I have seen this movie.
user1: Keanu Reeves is a good action star.
user2: Yes he is!  I don't believe that I have actually seen this one though.  Is it a good suspense thriller?
user1: It is a great action thriller. it is the kind of movie that you just sit back and enjoy.
user1: The plot may be basic, but the action more than makes up for it.
user2: I tend to like those..  It seems as though his role is that of an ex-hitman.  Could u tell me a little more about it?  Is it something that children should clearly not watch?
user1: This definitely not a children's movie. It has a lot of brutal violence in it.
user2: Ok.  That is good to know!  In your own opinion, what other movie does it resemble?  Or is it something of its own?
user1: I think that it resembles a lot of Jason Stathem films.
user2: It says that his wife is deceased, does it go into detail as to why or how it happened?
user1: It sadly was not stated how or why his wife died.
user2: I didn't know if it was part of the plot or anything.  I tend to lean towards movies that have a strong beginning to keep my attention thru the whole thing.  Does it start off slow or anything?
user1: I would say that it does start off a bit slow, but it is not too bad in that regard. It really ramps up from the middle until the end of the movie.
user2: Ok!  What other features of this movie did u like?
user1: I like the use of colors and cinematography. The movie has a colorful, saturated look to it that keeps your attention.
user1: The acting is also surprisingly strong for the type of movie this is.
user2: I like good movie features like that.  Could u tell me a bit more about where it takes place?  Any other well known actors/actress in it?
user1: Well, there's Keanu Reeves, who is the biggest known star. There is also Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones fame. The location is from multiple places.
user1: I cannot remember the specific places though.
user2: Ok!  Seems like a very interesting movie!  
user1: It is. I hope you enjoy it.
user2: I am sure it will be added to something I do watch, even if it is a bit of an older movie!  Looks like the scoring on it seems pretty good.  I am all about good reviews!
user2: I really am all about a good, suspense/action movie!  
user1: I am too.
user1: The movie also has some great scenes.
user1: The club scene was great.
user2: Weird thing is, I am all about a great hitman movie!   Club scene?  I assume lots of gunfire??
user1: Yeah, the scene has a strong Hitman vibe to it.
user1: Expect Keanu is far less stealthy
user2: Is the ending good or one of those that will take you by surprise and wishing there was more?
user1: The ending feels a bit undercooked compared to the middle of the movie, which is my biggest complaint with the movie.
user2: My all time favorite Keanu Reeves movie is still Speed!
user2: I get a bit frustrated with terrible endings!
user1: me too

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi!

conversation:

user1: Do you like action movies?
user2: keanu reeves was pretty good
user2: yea
user2: john wick 2 was not as good as the first one
user1: Ah I see. This movie seems to have a rating of 6.9/10
user1: on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: that's not too bad
user1: Yeah it seems average.
user2: did you watch it?
user1: I haven't
user2: you should rent it
user1: You've watched it?
user2: yea it's not too bad
user1: Yeah maybe I should.
user1: Do you enjoy movies with Keanu Reeves?
user2: ehhh his movies are okay.

user1: Don't mess with John Wick huh

user2: serious

conversation:
user2: hello
user2: lets earn some money!
user1: You don't have a document I think
user2: I dont ..hahaha
user1: Let me read first
user2: ok
user1: It is about an action movie John Wick.
user2: oh nice
user2: who is the lead actor
user1: Keanu Reeves, he is really good. he is really dead pan in this film
user2: i love that guy he never ages..his first movie i saw was matrix
user2: whats the rating of the movie?
user1: He is playing a ex-hit man in this film, the rating was 6.9/10 on metecritic and 86% on rotten tomatoes
user2: quite low though ..but at least its not less than 5
user2: i usually don't watch a movie if its rating is below 5
user1: It is a divisive movie, some liked it some hated it, the plot is really simple, russian mafia kills John's Wick puppy, he takes revenge on them
user1: The first part is about describing how badass is John Wick. 
user2: sweet
user2: from what u have read do u think u will watch it?
user1: Yes, it is like a western movie, the plot maybe lacking but the action sequences are really good.
user1: The second we see Jon Wick in action, he tries to kill the guy who kill his puppy in a nightclub. 
user2: ewww...i dont like movies with blood
user2: killing a puppy is just too much
user2: but then its a movie ..hahaha
user1: That why he is taking revenge.
user1: It one action scene after another.
user1: A fight in a nightclub, in a Hotel room, then in a church which serve as a front for the russian mafia
user2: it sounds really action packed
user2: who is d director?
user1: Chad Stahelski and David Leitch
user2: wow quite unpopular
user2: but they seem to have conquered the US market for them to get a rating of 6.8 for this movie
user1: Then the last part it is a big fight in an harbor. Where John Wick wants to kill the head of the russian mafia. 
user1: It is really just an action movie with a very thin plot, like old king-fu movies
user2: wow
user1: He gets a new puppy at the end
user2: seems u love d movie already
user2: our time is up
user2: nice chatting wit u buddy
user1: It is a really great movie, you should see it
user2: u narrated it well..will watch it
user2: sure :)

user2: If you are this is one of his somewhat more recent films. John Wick
user1: Are you still reading?
user1: Are you still reading?
user2: ok
user2: have you seen it?
user1: Are you still reading the document?
user1: how are you?
user2: I'm good

user2: It is an action thriller
user1: ?
user1: ?
user2: the movie John Wick
user1: what's the name of the movie?
user1: what's the name of the movie?
user1: what's the name of the movie?h
user2: John Wick
user2: starring Keanu Reeves

conversation:
user2: John Wick is a 2014 action thriller starring Keanu Reeves.
user1: What is the story about?
user2: It focuses on John Wick a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the theft of his car and killing his dog. 
user1: Is there any other popular actors actresses in it other than Keanu Reeves? 
user2: Yes it also has John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe
user1: It sounds interesting. Does he have a girlfriend in the movie or wife?
user2: Yes has recently died and was the one who gave him the puppy. 
user1: How sad. What kind of dog was it? 
user2: It doesn't say
user1: Do you know what kind of rating it has? Rate R, PG-13 etc?
user2: I don't have that info either. 
user1: I wonder if it has a lot of violence in it. Trying to decide if I want to see it or not
user2: Yes according to the review it is very violent. 
user1: Do you know how his wife died? Oh okay thanks for the info on the violence part.
user2: No the only thing I know is that she recently died. 
user1: Does the review say if the movie is long in length or average?
user2: No it doesn't say how long it is, sorry.
user1: Who is the villian in it, the one who killed his dog?
user2: Viggo and Losef are the villians, I assume they killed the dog. They are part of a Russian crime syndicate. 
user1: Is this part of a series? Does it explain any of the brutal violence in it? 
user2: I think this is the first in a series. The violence is explained because he is a ex-hitman in a dangerous world. 
user1: Did the person in the review like or hate the movie? 
user2: It is an impartial review, just gives the fact no opinions. 
user1: I'm still trying to decide if I want to see it or not. I like thrillers but don't like too much bloody violence. So I am assuming Wick goes after them on his own with no partners? 
user2: That is correct, he is a lone wolf in this. I think this will have lots of blood and violence, so probably not a movie you would enjoy. 
user1: I really like Keanu Reeves though I think he is a really good actor so I am undecided. Is there anything else you could tell me about the storyline? 
user2: Well it is not classic Keanu. They say that there is no humour in this movie which Keanu does better with than just straight up violence like this movie is. 
user1: Right so it is a totally different role for him. More serious. Does it say if the villians die or not and Wick gets his revenge? I am assuming he does
user2: Yes he is able to kill Viggo at the end of the movie. He also gets a happy ending by picking up a new puppy that was about to be killed. 
user1: What happens to the other villian does he get away ? That is a happy ending I think I will check it out just because I love Keanu Reeves and seeing him in a different role would be interesting. 
user2: Yes he kills Viggo's son before he kills Viggo. 
user1: Thanks for all the info on the movie. I will check it out. 
user2: You're welcome

user2: ARE YOU FROM
user1: Yeah, and hes role in Jhon Wick is really great, it has good critical responses

user2: WHICH SCENES DO YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE
user1: I like the scense when Winston calls and informs Jhon that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. 

conversation:
user1: Hello 
user2: Hello. Shall we talk about the movie John Wick? I have seen it and can highly recommend it.
user2: The movie is about a retired hitman who is forced to get revenge on some of his former employers.
user1: Sure - can you tell me about it?
user1: "forced" by whom? 
user2: I say 'forced.' The main character, played by Keanu Reeves, is treated horribly by the arrogant son of the crime bosses he used to work for. As in, beaten up, his car stolen, and his new puppy killed by them. They just think he's some guy with a nice car.
user1: I really like Keanu Reeves - and that does sound interesting! 
user1: What did you say the name of this movie is? 
user2: It's called John Wick. It's action-heavy, but it's got some humor, too. Lots of fun cameos as well. Like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe
user1: Not familiar with those names, is this a new movie? 
user2: It's from 2014, so somewhat new.
user1: Honestly, I was just looking at a description of it - you've gotten me interested 
user2: I was surprised when I watched it, too. It was a lot better than it sounded. The plot is sort of thin, as in a guy goes on a killing streak for being treated awfully. But it really is worth watching
user1: I'll be sure to check it out - thanks! 
user1: I liked Keanu Reeves in The Matrix - have you seen that? 
user2: I like the Matrix a lot. The first one, not the sequels, though.
user2: What did you like about The Matrix?
user1: I agree. Wouldn't even typically watch that kind of a movie, except that I kept hearing from people that "I really needed to see it" 
user1: Its actually more of a documentary, than faction - as it turns out. 
user2: Yeah. John Wick is the same kind of thing. "Need to see it." Not for the plot, but for the world they create. There's a secret assassin underworld. Special hotels, special night clubs, etc.
user1: Really? I wouldn't think there are that many assassins to create whole business's around them! 
user1: Are you familiar with the CIA "heart-attack gun"? Its just like it sounds...
user2: Yeah, it sort of went a bit far with the special services. But they were only located in major cities.
user2: Well, John Wick is a lot less serious than real CIA stuff. It's amusing rather than disturbing.
user1: Sure. Actually, watching all the revelations that are finally coming to the fore - is better than ANY movie I've ever seen! Do you know who the BIGGEST drug dealers in the world are/have always been? 
user2: Anyway, you might enjoy John Wick. It sounds silly, but it's quite a lot of fun
user1: No, doesn't sound silly - I'm from Chicago and spent many years in the restaurant business...lol 
user1: Knew them "all" - the mobsters and their counterparts, law enforcement 
user2: Well, the hotel scenes/night club scenes might be of interest to you. Made it seem pretty interesting/glamorous, rather than what a life as a paid killer probably was
user2: It was the best thing Keanu was in since the Matrix, I'd say
user1: LOL - people also think that the restaurant business is "glamorous" too. Its NOT. Its hard work, long hours, with weekends and holidays 
user2: Glamorous people might come to a restaurant, but someone has to cook them the food and throw away what they don't eat. I'm sure life in the restaurant is a lot more difficult.
user1: Okay, well thanks so much for telling me about it. Will definitely check it out!Looks like we've chatted to someone's satisfaction here, as "finish conversation" has now enabled. Have a great day!
user2: Thanks!

conversation:
user2: I thought it was a great movie. I enjoy most films I've seen with Keanu Reeves.
user1: I agree; It was a great movie filled with action.
user2: Is action your favorite genre of movie?
user1: Yes. This film genre is the most entertaining in my opinion.
user1: Do you agree?
user2: It's definitely one of my favorites as well. I enjoy over the top, sort of unrealistic action scenes, and this definitely pulled that off.
user1: Yes, it felt as if every scene in the movie grabbed my attention. 
user2: Totally agreed, it was so serious, and just focused on the action.
user2: I think the director did a great job.
user1: Yes, I find that several movies lately fail to develop the characters , since the story has to be told in about 90 mins, but this movie went straight to the point
user2: I loved how fast this scene was. The moment the shop owner recognized the main character he immediately threw the punch. There was almost no down time.

conversation:
user2: Inceptions was such a great idea
user1: John Wick was a good action movie. 
user1: Keanu Reeves is a great action star.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: Have you seen John Wick?
user2: No will use chat 
user2: no, haveyou?
user1: Yes the movie was fantastic, Have you never heard of it?
user2: No have you?
user2: heard of it from friends.
user1: It's one of the best action movies out.  Why haven't you seen it yet?
user2: Have not gone to movies in a while.
user2: I understand Keanu Reeves does a great job in it.
user1: I absolutely recommend it, you can see it pretty much anywhere now.
user1: Yes he does an awesome job in the film, probably one of the best actors in the business
user2: I plan to when I get a chance
user1: He makes the character very believeable
user1: I don't really  like the reviews the movie has gotten, as they don't do the movie justice
user2: The directors are very well known and do a great job too.
user2: It sounds like I have to go see it now with your recommendations.
user1: I have to be honest I've never heard of the directors actually, but I will be following them closely from now on.
user1: Oh absolutely, it is a refreshing movie to see with all the junk they have in hollywood.
user2: yes, they are known for their directing of action movies/
user1: the story is believable, it's a straight-up guy movie.
user1: We haven't had on in years before this film came out
user1: I like the whole underworld assassin story they went with, it really helped the movie along.
user2: Right like I said Keanu Reeves is a great actor in this film.
user1: The movie did so well there was even a sequel, so you have a treat waiting for you after you see the first one.
user2: Yes, and the female lead was very interesting as Ms. Perkins
user1: Yes, Perkins was a bit of a rebel in the film, breaking all the rules and such. I felt bad for Harry.
user2: Nice to know that there is a sequel.
user1: Yes and the story doesn't skip a beat, it's a complete continuation which I like.
user2: The ex hitman part was a great lead in to the story.
user1: Yeah, the best in the business trying to "get out" and have a normal life so to speak. I mean its been done before but in this film it fit perfectly
user2: he is believeable in seeking revenge
user2: John Wick is fired up and believeable in this action film.
user1: Oh absolutely, you can tell for him it was about principle and not just a kill everything blood bath.
user2: Right only for revenge but sounds like great action film
user1: Well, I have to head out but you go see that movie as soon as you can!
user1: Guaranteed you will enjoy it.
user2: Okay like I said on your reommendation.
user1: Have a good one!
user2: thank you for chatting.
user2: see you online again

conversation:
user1: Hi! How are you?
user2: Good,thank you.How are you ?
user2: Let's talk about the movie
user2: What was your favorite moment
user1: What movie?
user1: I mean, which one?
user2: John Wick
user2: part one\
user1: Oh, I haven't seen it yet. Is it good?
user1: What's it about?
user2: Awesome movie ,one of the best action movies this decade 
user1: Oh. Who is in it?
user2: Keanu Reeves as John Wick
user1: Oh, I love him! 
user1: I haven't seen anything from him lately. Glad he's still acting.
user2: Alfie Allen is also in it and Adrianne Palicki
user2: Movie is about crime syndicate and Keanu is ex-hitman
user1: I'm not familiar with them. Sounds exciting! When is it/was it released?
user2: 2014
user2: Chad Stahelski is the Director 
user1: Oh, do you know anything else he has directed? I've not heard of him.
user2: He was involved in many movies,Stunts for Matrix reloaded ,he was second unit director in Captain America Civil War
user2: etc..
user1: Oh cool, I love the Matrix series. I think I had dvds of all of them.
user1: It's been so long since I've watched them though. 
user2: you must watch this movie believe me ,and second part too 
user1: I think I will. It sounds good.
user1: And had Keanu in it. Another plus.
user2: and he is driving amazing Mustang classic
user1: Even better. What color?
user2: Black. the Russians killed his dog 
user2: only thing that left from his wife that died
user2: so he ... kill them all 
user2: there are so many great scenes 
user1: That's terrible. I mean, it sounds interesting, and exciting. 
user1: I hate violence against dogs though!
user2: me too
user1: I assume you don't see that part in the movie though. 
user1: That would be terrible.
user1: Well it was nice chatting. Maybe I'll try to watch that movie this weekend!
user2: OK

conversation:
user2: Hey, have you seen John Wick? It's a pretty good action movie about hitmen. I'd recommend it.
user1: I have seen this movie
user1: it's good
user1: I thought the plot in the movie was actually really good and I had no issue with how it worked it was something that I thought really stood with me, how about you?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: How are you?
user1: I'm good. How about you?
user2: We should talk about the movie John Wick. Have you watched it?
user2: Im doing all right, thanks for asking!
user1: No. I haven't but I think it would be a good movie. I really like Keanu Reeves.
user2: Oh yes, it is! It is weird to see him as an assassin. 
user2: However it is so good. The action scenes are amazing. Good soundtrack, too!}
user1: I know. I think the story line is really good.
user2: Yeah, I mean when I watched it I did not have any expectations
user2: The premise is simple, he is a retired assassin
user2: and they killed his dog
user1: I think that would be a very sad part of the movie since the puppy was given to him by his deceased wife.
user2: Its a revenge thriller, and it has a lot of style going on
user2: Exactly. Has a lot of emotion, and action at the same time
user1: That would really make it a good movie.
user2: Definitely. The coreography for the fight scene and the setting makes it amazing
user2: Has a good cast
user1: Yes. The cast is great. I think they would all work really good together.
user2: Exactly. Do you have a favorite action movie?
user1: I actually have several. Taken is one of my favorites. I will have to watch this one though because it sound like I would really enjoy it.
user2: Definitely
user2: I love the Taken series
user2: Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors
user1: I like the part where the mustang is taken to the chop shop, and Aurelio recognizes it as being John Wick's. Sounds like John Wick was a favorite assassin.
user2: Yeah exactly! Loved that part.
user2: Do you have a movie you are looking forward to watching this year?
user1: I have been wanting to see the movie American Assassian. I haven't got to see it yet. I heard it was really good.
user1: I think the part about John Wick not being able to leave his old life behind is sad. I think he finally found happiness with his wife, and he was wanting to live a normal life and people just would not let him. 
user2: That sounds great!
user2: I want to see the Phantom Thread, the last movie by Daniel Day Lewis
user2: He is retiring
user2: Exactly. I think he was depressed
user1: Yes. That sounds like it would be a good movie also. Have you seen the movie Point Break with Keanu Reeves? It was really good also.
user2: His life was really sad after his wife died
user2: I loved Point Break
user2: the scene with the masks robbing the bank
user2: one of the classics
user1: Yes. It was really good.
user1: Oh...I just noticed the part about John stopping at the waterfront clinic to treat his wound and he takes the pit bull puppy to keep it from being killed. This shows he had a kind heart.
user2: Keanu was really good in the Matrix as well.
user2: He had a very noble heart
user1: Yes. Come to think of it, I have seen this movie. I did not remember it at first but I started talking about it and I remember seeing it. It was a very good show.One of his best. As a matter of fact, I think I watched it not to long ago.
user2: Thats awesome! Good talking to you. Appreciate the talk. 

conversation:
user2: Keanu Reeves did a really great job in the movie John Wick, don't you think so?
user1: I do think so.  I think this was the perfect role for him.
user2: I believe this was the first installment for the movie series.
user1: Yes and it had very good reviews which is probably why they made another.
user1: I think it is an interesting story line having John Wick be a retired hitman
user2: Yes a Rotten Tomatoes score of 86% is really good! Do you remember who played the head of the Tarasov family?
user1: I believe it was Michael Nyqvist
user2: Yes it is, and trying to get revenge for them stealing his car and killing his puppy. That is so sad.
user1: Very sad, you can feel his pain and anger in the movie.  He does a great job portraying the pain and anger.
user1: Do you remember who Adrianne Palicki plays? 
user2: Yes he does, Keanu Reeves is a very talented actor. I believe this was his first movie of this genre in some time and he really performed.
user2: I believe she plays Ms. Perkins, a contract killer.
user2: Do you remember when the car gets taken to the chop shop?
user1: I do, that was an intense scene.  What was your favorite part about it?
user2: I enjoyed watching Aurelio recognize the car and punching Iosef and throwing him out. That was awesome!
user2: Do you remember what John Wicks nickname was as an assassin?
user1: I think it was Baba Yaga
user1: Do you remember who was the head of the Tarasov family
user2: Viggo I believe was the head of the Tarasov family. Didn't he have a son also? 
user1: Yes his son was losef
user2: I loved the scene where John goes to that nightclub and takes everyone out to get to Iosef. Do you remember the name of the nightclub?
user1: Yes that was a good scene.  I liked the suspense of it.  All the action of him trying to get to losef but then Kirill allows losef to escape
user2: Yes. I just remembered the name of the club was Red Circle. What an odd name for a night club
user1: That is an odd name.  Do you remember the scene where he goes the Little Russia church (also a weird name)
user2: I really liked the fact that Marcus kept helping John throughout the movie. He was always there to assist and save John. 
user2: It was so sad that Marcus died in the end, that torture scene was instense!
user1: I agree it was very sad!  John already had lost so much and then loses him too
user2: I did like that Perkins ended up being killed for her breaking the rules though.
user1: I liked the scene where John and Viggo are on the dock fighting
user2: Do you remember what breed of dog it was that John ends up taking from that clinic at the end?
user1: I think it was a pit bull puppy. It was so cute!
user2: Yes that scene was very good! 
user1: I like that they added John and that dog meeting being that he lost his dog
user2: Yes it was. He saved that poor puppy from being put down. I think in the end he saved the dog and the dog saved him as well. That ending scene with him and the dog in the spot where he and his wife had their last date, so sad.
user1: It is so sad and sweet as well.  It shows how special dogs are and how much they can help during hard times
user1: Do you remember what year this movie came out
user2: This is true. It's no wonder the movie had such good reviews. A metacritic Score of 68/100 was a bit low I thought, but that's just my opinion.
user2: I believe it was 2014.
user1: I agree it was a bit low.  Although I do pay attention to critic reviews a lot of the time I do not agree with them.  There have been many movies with bad reviews that I thought were good
user2: Kind of messed up that only Chad Stahelski got credit for directing the movie even though he was assisted by another guy. Do you remember his name? 
user2: Exactly! The critics aren't always right.
user1: I think the other director is David Leitch
user2: Yes that was his name! Thanks I couldn't remember it at all.
user2: I think this was considered a neo-noir action thriller correct?

conversation:
user1: The movie is an action movie, John Wick 
user2: Okay
user1: It is a very intense and jam packed action movie, definitely worth watching!
user2: What is it about?
user1: Keanu Reeves is the main character and he used to be a hitman but was retired with a wife, whom died. 
user2: Does he have children?
user1: the plot is that he is a retired hitman seeking payback for the theft of his car and death of his puppy,given to him from his recently deceased wife.
user1: no he does not have children
user2: How did his wife die?
user1: I don't think they really said, but I think like terminal illness
user2: Is he after an organization responsible for the death or a single person?
user1: Well like a big man on the totem pole has a kid and that kid (in his 20's) steals his car and brutally kills his dog when he isn't home and leaves the dog there for him to find
user2: How does his character in this movie compare to his other roles? He is usually known for being a soft, loving man. Much like his character in the Lake house.
user1: he is kind of after the whole group but specifically a guy called Iosef who is played by Alfie Allen
user2: How well would you rate this film? 
user1: He is like violent and yet also comical! 
user1: I would rate it a 9 out of 10, it kept me captivated!
user2: How does the action compare to other action films?
user1: There isn't like blood and gore, but some action shooting scenes and some fighting scenes. lots of nice cars in it.
user2: Is this movie in theaters or is there another way to watch? It sounds interesting!
user1: Viggo is the kids dad, he is the like big guy in charge of the mob, he kind of taunts John when they meet about how it is funny John thinks he can retire and leaves this life behind
user1: it is not in theaters as it came out in 2014
user2: I don't  know if that is a life you can leave behind!
user2: Someone probably holds a grudge against him!
user2: How are the graphics?
user1: they really could do with a prequel of showing him before retired and what not, they say he was the best hitman viggo had
user1: the graphics and picture are really good, some scenes are "dark" like at night clubs, docks, warehouses, and such
user2: He used to work for Viggo? Ans viggo's kid killed John's dog? That sounds like he is trying to get back at him for something!
user2: Bad blood for retiring? Or at least "trying" to retire!
user1: i dont think the kid knew what john was to be honest, when his dad found out he pretty much said "you made a mistake as John wick is the boogeyman"
user1: the ending is nice though, very sweet! i wont ruin that for you
user2: Wow! That kid messed up.
user2: I definitely like the sound of it!

conversation:
user1: hello, John Wick got a great score on rotten tomatoes but kinda stumbled on meta critic
user2: I agreed and I think Metacritic Score could've done much better knowing that Rotten Tomatoes has been around for quite sometimes. 
user1: I really like the action in the movie and Keanu Reeves was terrific in it. 
user2: Keanu Reeves plays as an ex-hitman in this movie which he plays as an action hero in this movie. 
user1: Yea i really liked how he was going after the Russian crime factions, it gave it a sort of believable plot. 
user2: I think some of those critical responses are quite spectacular but I just don't understand why Metacritic Score gave such a low rating on this film. 
user1: Yea metacritic seems to low for John Wick. I think the critics were to hard on it while the audiences loved it. 
user2: I am not even sure if some individuals in Metacritic Score have seen the film. If so, there wouldn
user2: wouldn't been a huge gap between both websites.
user1: Yea thats true. Cinema Score gave it a B so it got at least some recognition. 
user2: In the top key scene number 1 tells us that John has a nickname by the name of "Baba Yaga'. 
user1: Haha yea thats a cool fact. I like that this movie has a ton of action and is never really waiting around for stuff to happen in it. 
user2: I haven't seen the movie but so far I think this film is about John Wick who used to work as a hitman and after getting out he is going back to get revenge on the death of his wife. 
user1: Yes, hes trying to get revenge for his wifes killers and there are in a Russian mafia family. 
user2: Losef is the son of Viggo which happens to be the head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York City. That's interesting because I thought the setting of the film took place else where. 
user1: Yes its kind of confusing because he is Russian but he lives in New York City. But i believe they go to other cities as the film progresses. 
user2: John is basically killing his way to get to losef but what's interesting is about Ms. Perkins. I wonder if she is his protagonist or antagonist in this film. 
user1: I believe she might be a bit of both sort of like a double agent in the film. 
user2: I don't like the fact that it took Viggo's life to find and finally kill losef. Viggo should've been the mean antagonist that is harder to find and destroy. 
user1: Yes i  agree, but John Wick kinda had to go through the whole family with underbosses to finally get to him.
user2: Losef was able to escape but momentarily killed at his safe house. I think this scene of the movie was a bit too vague. The director should've made it more interesting.
user1: Yea thats true but i think they wanted to leave it kind of vauge to make the movie more interesting because you wouldnt know if he could come back or not. 
user2: I think that is one reason why this film received such a low rating on Metacritic Score compared to Rotten Tomatoes because the ending was too vague. 
user1: That could be one of the reasons. Maybe the audience was confussed aboput what happened at the end and didnt like it because of that. 
user2: Also, I like how Keanu Reeves was able to star in this film as John Wick and I think he did a great job based on the given story line excluding the ending. 
user1: Yes i thought he was really good in the movie and did a great job acting in it.
user1: we should be able to finish the conversation now
user2: I don't like the fact that Ms. Perkins was killed in this film and I think to make it more interesting the director this film should've made Ms. Perkins some how fell in love with John giving him a new hope in life. 

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: howdy
user2: did you see this movie?
user1: Did you see this movie?
user1: I love Keanu Reeves.
user2: I did not
user2: meh
user1: I did not see it either but its on my list
user1: I guess meh means you are not interested?
user2: why a fan of Kanu?
user1: I like Wilem Dafoe too.
user1: Anything they are in must be good.
user2: are you a real person?
user1: He is dark and mysterious and a little bad!
user1: I like to think of myself as real
user1: I am real
user1: I am typing nothing is being posted.
user2: do you usually trust the rotten tomatoes average joe score or the critic scores on movies?
user1: Oh yes it is-sorry
user1: Rotten Tomatoes is good
user1: I usullay know if I am going to like something
user2: On the critics, it's hard to trust their take.  Especially if a movie has the "right" political message, etc.
user1: That is true-everything is politics now
user1: I gave up my cable because I am sick of politics
user2: Ah, of course.  The Russian Orthodox Church is in cahoots with the mob in this movie.  Russian + Christian = obvious bad guys
user1: I like to just enjoy movies
user2: (I'm Russian Orthodox.)  
user1: Everyone is a bad guy to someone. I think I still want to see the movie but will ignore the message
user1: I am Lutheran-we like everyone
user2: This kind of movie's not really up my alley.
user1: What other movies do you like?
user1: This one is sort of James Bond, I guess. Lots of action.
user2: The older I get, the lighter I like them.  I used to like dark movies like this but I've seen enough bad in real life that I want an escape
user1: That is true. I am seventy and I also have seen bad stuff. I still like adventures, though. I liked the Revenant.
user2: straight up action movies, yeah, are great.  It's the violence that is getting harder
user1: I like scary horror movies too. You know they are not real. Ghost stories are good.
user1: There is enough violence in the news
user2: Depends on the horror movie.  Monster/alien movies, no problem.  Crazy humans/demons, not so much.
user1: I like stories where people aren't being chopped up.
user2: :)
user1: I like a little humor in there too
user2: a must
user2: yo
user2: what's up?

conversation:
user1: you should watch this movie
user2: What movie is that?
user1: John Wick
user2: Oh! Is it exciting? 
user1: Yeah it's an action movie and it got 86% on rotten tomatoes
user2: It sounds like a good one. Does it have car chases? Or big explosions? 
user1: I'm not sure, there are a l ot of "knock-your-socks-off" action sequences though and its got Keanu reeves in it
user2: Well I can't deny that I quite enjoy a film that makes my jaw drop.
user1: It came out in 2014 and is apparently set up for a sequel as well
user1: how do you choose a good movie?
user2: I look for something that appeals to my senses. If it's visually appealing and keeps me engaged, then tends to be be a keeper. 
user2: With action sequences like you describe John Wick would probably be something right up my alley. 
user1: Yeah there's a cool scene where the guys that steal John's car get thrown out of the shop when they try to change the VIN
user1: and they realize who John really is
user1: aka "the Baba Yaga"
user1: it really sets the stage for more upcoming action sequences
user2: ooOOooo. Mysterious appeal. You really are steering me toward it. 
user2: So even though it's an older film, it's not outdated
user1: It came out in 2014 which i don't think is too old
user2: Yeah, but some of them can be so dated, even if they are only 3 or 4 years old. 
user1: Hmm what do you mean by outdated though
user2: It's sometimes - it can take me out of the feel of the film - if they are using outdated technology, but it's not a period piece.
user2: you know like "Why are they using a payphone?" 
user1: Well there's a lot of modern scenes in this movie involving nightclubs and SUVs and whatnot
user1: Oooh I see what you mean
user1: I'm not sure if there's a scene with payphones actually
user1: or other outdated tech
user2: *laughs* Probably not. :)
user2: But It sounds like there's plenty of intrigue there too. 
user2: I'm so glad you are recommending this to me. I was hoping to find a new (to me) movie to see 
user2: But tell me true, Is there a love story aspect? 
user1: Yeah! There's a lot of mysterious characters including his wife who you don't really hear about
user1: I'm not sure if there's a love story aspect
user1: the genre is listed as action
user2: *phew* Sometimes they throw something like in there and it feels so out of place. 
user1: something like what?
user2: Just throwing in a love story aspect. He got the girl! But, you know, he wasn't trying for that at all throughout the film. It's like... I don't need a kiss at the end to be tossed in... after a long exciting story. 
user1: ohh i see what you mean, yeah there's no mention of a girl except for his wife in any of the scenes
user2: But he's got a wife who might just be an unexpected character adding to the plot. 
user2: You really have me intrigued. 
user1: yup, guess you'll have to watch to find out!
user2: I will! From start to finish. 

conversation:
user2: Good morning
user1: Mornin
user1: So I chose a movie to talk about, but it randomly assigned me a different movie.
user1: So let's talk about a movie I've never seen, John WIck.
user1: Basically Keanu Reeves is an ex-hitman who fights against a Russian crime syndicate after the death of his wife.
user1: He is also trying to get revenge because they stole his car and killed his dog.
user1: If I had a dog and someone killed it I know I would be trying to hurt them really bad.
user1: So do you have anything to add to this conversation?

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: hello!
user2: Are you still there?
user2: I am still here...
user2: I am here, but have no knowledge of what movie you are reading
user2: I will wait
user2: but realize that you are likely not there
user2: Maybe the movie selected was offensive? 
user2: or perhaps you lost internet connection. 
user2: I cannot know for sure what happened, or where you went. 

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello
user1: How are you?
user2: keanu reeves never gets old
user2: pity the ratings are low
user2: have u seen the movie before?
user2: oh im good, thanks for asking :)
user1: I like keanu reeves and he does hold his age well
user1: which movie are we discussing?
user2: agreed 
user2: John Wick
user1: I was thinking about seeing that one.
user2: and he is the star in that
user1: would you recommend it?
user1: I've seen him in action/adventure movies before is this one of those?
user2: i think this is his most recent effort although its already 4 years old
user1: Did you enjoy it?
user2: he acts as the best assasin in town that retired because his wife was killed.
user1: sounds like an action flick!
user1: Was it very violent and graphic?
user1: Was this movie rated R?

conversation:
user1: Hi, is the movie good?
user2: I thought the movie was excellent.  I would suggest it if you like action films.
user1: What's the name?
user2: What did you think?
user2: John Wick
user1: I think so. Who's main character?
user2: Keanu Reeves plays the main character along with Ian McShane
user1: Oh ok. What's his job?
user1: He was upset over something wasn't he?
user2: He is an ex hitman who returns to that world after his wife died. Alfie Allen is the punky foolish son of a Russian Crime family who steals John Wick's car and killed his new puppy that his dead wife sent to John.
user1: Terrible! He seeks revenge?
user2: Oh yeah, goes nuts!  Killing everyone and getting even.  It was awesome!
user1: Sounds like. Did others try to harm him?
user2: Of course!  The entire Russian enterprise was out to get him. He killed everyone that got in his way or tried to kill him.
user1: He got Alfie too?
user2: He got Alfie in a club and had no remorse.  Just a cold execution, while fending off all his bodyguards, who failed in their job to protect Alfie.
user1: Serves him right! He didn't get innocent victims though?
user2: No one was innocent in this film..lol But no, he didn't kill any innocents.
user1: lol, I'm sure there was plenty trying to stop him too. Did he decide to go back to this as a profession?
user2: No, he only got the revenge on the people who harmed him and then went back to being a "normal" guy.
user1: Think it be hard to do that huh lol. I wonder if he will get a new puppy?
user2: At the end of the movie, he does get another dog, just not  a puppy.
user1: Sounds like he needs a friend. He made some enemies along the way?
user2: I don't think he made any new enemies, just the original Russian family and according henchmen.  Again, no innocent people were in the film.  Each character had a specific role within the "hitman" world.  Winston, played by Ian McShane, was the safe hotel where no matter what your assignment was as a hitman, you could go and stay and the hotel, but of course, one of the rules of the hotel was, no business on the grounds.
user1: But, he still conducted business there?
user2: but he didn't initiate it.
user2: Business meant killing.
user1: Well, can't blame him for protecting himself. Did he encounter female assassins?
user2: Only one, and she was the one who tried to kill him in the hotel room.
user1: Well, thanks for telling me about the movie!
user2: Adrianne Palicki played Ms. Perkins, the female contract killer
user2: Your welcom.
