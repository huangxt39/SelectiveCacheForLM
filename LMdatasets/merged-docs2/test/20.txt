critical response:
one of the most important stories of the last century is one of the greatest movies of 2014
Empire described it as a 'superb thriller' and Glamour declared it 'an instant classic'.
Peter Debruge of Variety added that the film is 'beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed'.
movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare to chafe at society's established norms
The Hollywood Reporter reported that the highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, 'whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work
I discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park'.
Andrew Grant of Science News wrote, '... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license   which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling.

description:
In 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park. In 1927, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography, and Turing develops romantic feelings for him. Before Turing can confess his love, Christopher dies unexpectedly from tuberculosis. When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park, where, under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are trying to decrypt the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages. 
Turing s machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma settings before the Germans reset the Enigma encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate; however, Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken. 
Turing discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing s homosexuality if his role as an agent is revealed. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already, and planted Cairncross among them in order to leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay and lying about never having cared for her. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done. 

conversation:
user1: How mdid you like british cryptography moives
user2: I like them a lot, The Imitation Game was a good example of this
user1: dram biopic movie
user2: Yes, the director of it was Morten Tyldum
user1: I would agree. historically good too
user1: not familiar with him but a good movie
user2: It was rated very highly by critics all over the world
user1: got good reviews as I see from rotten tomatoes and others
user2: Benedict Cumberbatch was a great actor in the lead role
user1: would agree and I like to warch Keira knightly too
user2: She was great in her role as Joan Clarke
user1: I prefer sci fy but got this vid instead\\
user2: I agree, this is more of a historical film like the scenes where Britain declares war on Germany
user1: good early storyline on how he got involved in crypto work'
user1: the enigma machine is an important historical item 
user2: Yes, he got involved with Christopher Morcom who sparked his interest in crypto
user1: without the crypo anbalyssi would have been very hard during ww2
user1: intersting topic cryopto for me too
user2: Yes, they used it to decrypt the messages the Nazis were sending
user1: cool story factor about him tryingto be fired
user1: his recalibration of machine after an epiohany
user2: Yes, that was instrumental to solving the mysteries of the enigma machine
user1: names his machine christopher
user2: I assume that was named after Christopher morcom
user1: turing proposaes marrige and is accepted but admits he is a homosexual?
user1: who was mccorom again?
user2: Morcom was the man who sparked Turing's interest in cryptography
user1: or never mind i forgot his friend chris'
user2: Yeah it turns out being a homosexual played a big part in Turing's life
user1: intriguode with caimcross next
user1: interested how the homosexual part played a role
user2: Oh yes, Caimcross was a soviet spy
user2: When you watched the movie what did you think about Caimcross
user1: I watched parts here and there so I was rather vague on some details
user1: ultinmalety tels the people to destroy the crypto graoph machine why?
user2: Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work so they can never tell anything about the machines
user1: now computers here but before nothiog could compare top it except the huim,an brain
user2: Did you think that it was a sad part of the movie?
user1: amazing hoiw technogoly has advanced 
user1: movie was cvool ioverall.
user1:  user 2 left the chat now what do I do????

conversation:
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: I just saw it.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: No, I usually like stuff with Benedict Cumberpatch though.
user1: It was such a thrilling movie. Based on the life of Alan Turing.
user2: Keira Knightly slightly annoys me however.
user1: Cumberbach was really the highlight of the film
user2: Got good reviews, Rotten tomatoes rarely goes over 90% it seems.
user2: Who is Alan Turing?
user1: true. Metacritic gave them 73/100. Turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the British during WWII against the Germans. He is famous for breaking the Enigma code.
user1: He was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home.
user1: Definitely see it if you get a chance.
user2: Dramas tend to kind of bore me usually, with many note-worthy exceptions. I like Comedies mostly or fantasy, Sci-fi. I will check it out though, all in all i just love movies!
user2: Sounds like an interesting fellow, will definetly give it a watch.
user1: It is really more of an espionage movie. It is pretty exciting. I guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with Morcom, his mentor.
user1: I think you will enjoy it.
user1: Morton Tyldum is a great director.
user2: Andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right, if he liked it i will probably hate it.
user2: The hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of Cumberpatch as i am.
user1: It is kind of technical. It goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code. He has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows. You will probably enjoy that.
user1: Cumberbach does a great job acting.
user2: These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.
user1: The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that.
user1: It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.
user2: I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!
user1: I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.
user1: There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.
user2: If he marries Keira knightly i may be shouting at my T.V.
user1: Big drama when Turing confronts the russians.
user1: Yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance. It is not so bad though.
user1: She is trite, absolutely, but the director does make it work here.
user1: also, turns out he is gay!
user1: so she gets what she deserves.
user1: you might actualy like it.
user1: I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?
user2: Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!
user1: yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.
user1: I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.
user2: Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!
user1: Tuberculosis.
user1: Yeah I did love Beautiful mind. I read that that guy actually was working for the government.
user1: Talk about changing the story!
user1: Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!
user1: How come you dislike her so much?
user1: Is it because you guys used to date?
user2: Mostly just for hogging that driftwood in Titanic ;)
user1: Oh yeah. I have never seen that one. 
user2: I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.
user1: I know there is that song by celine dion.
user1: haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.
user1: She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas
user1: or something
user2: Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.
user2: Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.
user1: anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.
user2: oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.
user1: That is funny but you don't like Kiera. 
user1: I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.
user2: Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.
user1: Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.
user2: All of the Hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it.
user1: His theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life, and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life. He was certainly an interesting fellow.
user1: I seriously loved this Turing movie. You have to see it!!!
user2: I dont usually take anything the Hollywood reporter says to heart though.
user1: No they have their own problems. 
user1: And what do they know about science?
user2: Not since they gave The Big Lebowski such awful reviews.
user1: Turing is an important guy. I'd rather see a movie about Kurt Godel or Giordano Bruno.
user1: Or maybe a serious horror/drama about Galileo.
user1: I think the Big Lebowski was a great film I didn't realize it had a poor critical reception.
user1: I actually think I might write a script about the life of Galileo
user2: Your right, because Scientifically The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever made. yet, magazines like empire and Variety pee'd on its rug.
user1: people would love that it would make them feel smart.
user1: actually, that makes sense.
user1: I am actually ordained as a Dudist Priest.
user1: You can do it online for free, and then you can legally marry people.
user2: Go forth and Abide my son.
user1: Indeed. I shall Abide.
user2: oh i know, im also a member dude.
user1: Oh nice. I knew you were coolio foolio.
user2: there is a fun facebook page too, dudeism, check it out!
user1: What is up with this study though? I feel we are being watched. Do you think we will be in a movie with Benjamin Cumberbach?
user1: I will for sure check it out on the myface.
user1: I think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook.
user2: haha i use that term Myface all the time.
user2: great minds think alike.
user1: I once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar's
user1: but yes, they say iron knows iron
user2: It said there would be three pages, yet we seem to be done.
user1: anyways though, it is pretty exciting to see Turing recalibrate that machine. You will enjoy that.
user1: did you leave?

conversation:
user2: Hello, what's the name of the movie?
user1: Hi, it's the Imitation Game
user2: Does it seem interesting?
user1: Definitely, it takes place during WWII and it's decrypting spy code messages
user2: Cool, is there a main lead actor or actress that's easily identifiable?
user1: Yes, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly, it's got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore.
user2: Good to know, what studio is it produced by?
user1: I'm not sure about that but did you know there was an earlier movie about the same book?
user2: So it's based on a book?
user1: Yes, it's based on Alan Turing:  The Enigma and the earlier movie was called Breaking the Code, it was on BBC.
user2: Good to know, although I didn't ask; does it say who starred in the BBC version?
user1: No, but I've got info on a few of the key scenes if you're interested in knowing?
user2: Absolutely, are the scenes taken from the book, the BBC version, or the movie?
user1: From the 2014 movie with Cumberbatch and Knightley.  The earliest scene has Turing in boarding school being bullied, and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography.
user2: That's cool, so it's sort of a biographical movie?
user1: The next scene is when Britain declares war on Germany, Turing goes to work at a place called Bletchley Park that is trying to decode the Nazi's Enigma Machine.  Yes, it's a historical drama.
user1: Do you want to hear the plot?
user2: Does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real-life events; that's why I was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical?
user1: Oh.  One of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters.  
user2: Thanks for the clarification, are there any more excerpts?
user1: Yes, the plot sounds really good.  Turing manages to decrypt the Nazi code machine, but the Nazis change the code every day.  So they all realize they can't act on every day's decrypted messages or the Nazis will know that their code machine is useless.
user2: Interesting, does it mention how it's resolved, or does it leave you sort of on the cliff?
user1: It kind of leaves a cliffhanger there.  There are a couple of twists, though.
user2: Does it say whether the main characters survive to the end, or are they wounded, etcetera?
user1: It doesn't tell.  One of the twists in the plot is that a Russian spy is discovered by Turing.  Which isn't surprising at first, but then we find out that British intelligence planted him to tell the Russians secrets they wanted them to know, after all Russia and Great Britain were on the same side in WWII.
user2: That's sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation, but whatever, anything else super useful or interesting, (it sounds like a great movie)?
user1: When I watched the movie, I liked the codebreaking machine they had,  It was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of WWII.  Yes, there's another twist in the plot where the Russian spy threatens to tell everyone that Turing is homosexual.
user2: How did the spy know that Turing was gay?
user1: Turing told the spy, because Turing was about to get married to Clarke (Knightley).  It sounds like high drama to me.  The spy (before Turing realized he was a spy) told Turing to keep his homosexuality a secret.  I guess they were pretty tight.
user2: Wow, that's a big ol' ball of secrecy for that time period, is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me?
user1: Yes, at the end of the movie, the Allies win the war and the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code.  Also, Turing tells Clarke (Knightley) to leave because he is scared for her safety.  He tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her, which wasn't true because he was in love with her.
user1: It got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: What's the rotten tomatoes score?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes is 91%, CinemaScore is A+, and Metacritic Score is a bit low at 73/100.
user2: Hmm, not bad at all, does it say when it was released?
user1: I think that about does it for this movie, do you think you'll see it?
user1: in 2014
user2: It sounds really good, more likely than not, I will; how about you?
user1: I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this.  I remember it was really good.  If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.
user1: It was definitely a good look into what life was like during that horrible war.  It's been good chatting with you, I enjoyed.
user2: Lol, likewise, I'm pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie, right? 

conversation:
user1: Hello. what is the movie?
user2: Hey, the movie we got is The Imitation Game
user1: What is it about?
user2: It is a biography of about Alan Turing, a British cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes during World War 2.
user1: Who is the lead actors?
user2: The lead actors are Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley
user1: Do they successfully decrypt the code?
user2: I am not sure if they successfully decrypt the code, I would assume so otherwise I doubt it would be as historically relevant.
user1: Okay. What kind of movie is it? Thriller? Drama? Comedy?
user2: It is a drama
user1: Any other known actors in it?
user2: Yeah, there is Matthew Goode and Tom Goodman-Hill in the movie as well.
user1: How long is the movie?
user2: I am not sure how long the movie is, if I had to guess I'd say 2 hours.
user1: What year was it released originally?
user2: It was originally released in 2014.
user1: Did it win any awards?
user2: It doesn't mention winning any awards, however it has amazing reviews from different organizations.
user1: Can you tell me more about the reviews?
user2: The film received a CinemaScore of A+ as well as a Rotten Tomatoes review of 91%.
user2: There are quite a few key scenes throughout the movie that are relevant as well.
user1: Relevant to what?
user2: To the story. One of them explains how the main character, Alan Turing is unhappy in his boarding school due to bullying. It is through that unhappiness that he found his interest in cryptography.
user1: I 'm quite interested in the movie. Anything else you want to tell me?
user2: I don't want to give too much away, but there is a few points where characters are revealed as spys and release important information about the main character.
user1: Ph, spy. i love spy.
user2: I do too. Also, there are a lot of secrets within the movie about the main character as well that are incredibly important to the story.
user2: But I can't say
user1: How did it do in the box office?
user2: I don't have any specifics, but based off the reviews of the film I would say very well.
user1: What else do you know about the movie?
user2: I know that it has been regarded as one of the most important stories of the last century.
user1: Who is the director?
user2: There is some controversy however with the film, like some people are upset due to misrepresentation of facts and rearranging things to make a better story.
user2: The director was Morten Tyldum.
user1: Is it because the lead character is gay?
user2: I don't know if it has to due with him being gay, more so the order at which events were revealed misrepresented the work that Turning did at Bletchley Park.
user1: Thanks. It's nice chatting with you.
user2: You too!

conversation:
user1: looking for a movie to watch, have you seen any good ones?
user2: There is this one I saw recently with Benedict Cumberbatch - I liked it but it was not accurate historically speaking... 
user1: What was the name of the movie?
user2: The Imitation Game
user1: How inaccurate was it historically?
user2: If You like historical movies like that I mean - Benedict was awesome btw
user2: well quite
user1: if you watched it as pure fiction was it worth siin?
user1: seeing?
user2: What he did - brake the enigma code - in this movie it said ONLY him did it by creating this deciphering machine - where in fact, he used algorithms of Polish Mathematicians - google it.  
user2: It wasn't "pure" fiction. It was just inaccurate, but yes, I liked it and
user1: Very interesting, I will
user2: Keira Knightley - I will watch anything with her ;
user2: :)
user1: i wiil watch it
user2: Do You like historical movies like that ? re You British by any chance ?
user1: yes, but i am not are you
user2: I'm Polish :)  that's how I know these facts about that part in history ;)
user1: interesting, i am italiian
user2: Machine he build was actually VERY visually similar to the original one
user2: they did a great job with that
user1: I will google the history
user1: that is cool,
user2: the machine was working a little bit different though - it was based on mathematical algorithms and not really "words" recognition. they made it look "easy" for the hollywood ;)
user1: is it attention grapping
user1: that is hollywood 
user1: they do that often
user2: big part of this is drama and action - MI6 agents involved in this whole operation etc. I think You would like it
user1: i definitely am thinking about seeingit
user2: I think they overestimated British role in that time... just saying ;)
user2: that's why I asked You if You were British :) I didn't want to offend You
user1: i wont hold it to be fctual 

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hey there, just reading the document.
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: I have not seen this movie, but I do know of it.
user2: I've never seen it either.
user2: It sounds really interesting.
user2: I'm not really a fan of historical films or history for that matter.
user1: I think what has swayed me from watching it is that it takes place during WWII, but how interesting can decoding be when you have a war going on.  
user2: Which I suppose I should be, since they say history repeats itself. 
user2: I took it as he is breaking codes for the government. That would be pretty cool. 
user2: And pretty far ahead of his time period. 
user1: I enjoy movies about the Greatest Generation and WWII, and American ingenuity, but I'm not quite sold on the suspense factor of the movie.
user1: It takes place in Great Britain and I guess it's an English code breaker and I think he has a secret which may compromise the mission.
user2: Yeah, I don't think history is all that suspenseful either.
user2: Oh, well that might be interesting. Do you know if it does compromise the mission?
user1: I don't believe so, the new paragraph we were given at the top of the page touches on it.  
user2: Huh, I didn't know that Turning had a thing for Christopher. Now that is way before their time period!
user1: He got interested in cryptography through a friendship and a begins to have feelings for his friend but he dies before those feelings can be expressed.
user1: Maybe, maybe not, more like it existed throughout all of time but just wasn't socially accepted at the time.
user2: Too bad! That could have made for an interesting plot twist. 
user1: Which I gather would have disqualified him for the military position
user2: Oh, very true! I didn't think about that! 
user1: Ha!  He names the machine after him.
user2: I just read that! lol Too funny
user2: Wow, so he does tell someone he is homosexual. 
user1: Interesting twist, in that he confesses his secret and proposes to the woman.
user2: This sounds like it could be an interesting movie. 
user2: I know, how weird! Sounds more bisexual to me
user1: The plot thickens.
user2: Wow!!! Yeah it does. 
user1: Very interesting stuff, I mean he confesses he lied to her about caring and then they destroy his machine and work and what's left
user1: I could only imagine the pain, he must have felt losing his love, losing his friend, his career and all after possibly having a hand in saving the free world.
user2: That is so crazy! Like if he can't have Christopher he doesn't want anything
user2: I know so crazy!
user2: I'm going to look into watching this.
user2: Thanks for chatting with me. I'm going to finish the conversation.
user1: I wonder how this story surfaced and how many years later it was revealed that the members of this team where responsible for playing a part in saving the world

conversation:
user1: Hi. 'The Imitation Game' is based on a true story about code breaking in WWII. Great reviews.
user2: don
user2: it is about for good person
user1: It is about good people. It's a thriller, but actually happened.

conversation:
user1: I know this movie has been on netflix for a while and I've been meaning to watch it because I've heard it's really good but the subject matter seems more fantasized that what it really is.
user1: you ever seen it?
user2: I have never seen it
user2: It sounds interesting because I find WW2 very interesting, but I have not gotten around to seeing it
user2: I think decrypting intelligence codes could make for a good movie
user2: Are you interested in WW2?
user1: Yea whenenver I think about the movie it sound interesting but it probably wasn't as cool as the movie makes it out to be
user1: Yea I love almost everything about ww2
user1: I used to watch documentaries on it all the time
user2: Have you seen Dunkirk?
user2: I haven't yet but want to.  I like Christopher Nolan's stuff
user1: oh man I loved dunkirk
user1: saw it in imax and was blown away
user1: its more of a ww1 movie but it didn't feel too different since it focused less on war and action
user2: Gotcha.  Yah that's still high on my list to see
user1: it was a very tense movie and imitation game would probably be more like a suspenseful drama while dunkirk is suspenseful action
user2: I just put 2 and 2 together and realized Turing is the same guy that developed the Turing Test
user1: Do you pay much attention to critic reviews?  I feel like I do nowadays just because there's so much garbage I don't wanna waste my time.  This movie seems to have a good rating so it's prolly worth watching
user1: Yea pretty sure Turing and his research started modern computers right?
user2: I actually don't read much critic reviews, but I probably should.  I mainly use IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, just the scores
user2: Yah I think so
user2: Definitely seems like he would have been an interesting guy
user1: I watch those guys on youtube called redletter media a lot to see what they think but mainly because they're funny
user1: Yea he would have to have been really smart to figure out those codes
user1: would be worth watching the movie just to see how he does it
user2: I'll have to check it out
user2: They post videos reviewing movies?
user1: yea a lot of their videos are based on movies that are so bad it's good types of films but the other half of their stuff is reviewing mainstream movies.
user1: they have little gags and jokes obviously but they try to stick to critiquing the movie mostly
user1: One of the reviews on the document talks about how they added stuff to imitation game that wasn't real
user1: I had heard that before, hopefully it wasn't much because I'd rather more of a biopic than a mainstream thriller
user2: I'll have to definitely check it out
user2: Yah I noticed that review, hopefully they didn't twist the story too much
user1: I don't like reading the document too much as it might spoil some stuff
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch is almost too famous and might actually be distracting during the movie
user2: I agree.  You know who might have been a good choice?  Eddie Redmayne
user2: But I guess he played Stephen Hawking recently, so may be too similar of parts
user2: Interesting that Turing confirms he was gay but still got married.  Obviously still a "stigma" at that time.
user1: Yea he prolly woulda fit the bill nicely.  He was alright in fantastic beasts
user1: Yea seems he knew at an early age he was gay
user1: unfortunate that he liked that kid who died from tuberculosis.  rare disease to die from these days I believe
user2: Yah I think tuberculosis claimed a lot of people during that time
user2: Before they developed a cure I believe
user1: Crazy that his homosexuality could be used as a weapon against him and blackmail him back then
user1: Also strange that they destroyed their work you would think they could've used it for other things.
user2: Yah that is peculiar that they were ordered to destroy their work
user2: It reminds me of Nicola Tesla.  After he died his place was raided and work was stolen
user1: Oh yea, but Tesla's life ended in tragedy where I think Turing came out ok in the end.
user2: That is true
user2: Are we clear to click Finish Conversation?
user1: Tesla works could've put us years ahead in terms of science
user1: 'm not sure tbh
user1: my hit timer is at 27 mins
user1: not sure when we started
user2: Yah mine's at 29
user1: We had to do 25 right?
user2: I believe so
user2: and respond at least 12 times, which we have
user1: alright yea then we're done
user1: nice talking to ya
user1: good luck turkin out there
user2: Sounds good, you too

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user1: I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it deserves its 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: I have seen this movie. I though Benedict Cumberbatch was great in it.
user2: Had you heard about Turing before you saw this movie?
user1: I knew about the Turing test, but I didn't know his role in the war.
user1: I thought he was perfect for this role though.
user1: And I really enjoyed Keira Knightly's performance as well.
user2: Agreed. I'm surprised the Metacritic score is so low though.
user2: I also didn't realize it was originally a play.
user1: Yea, I am curious about that too.
user2: Have you seen other similar films?
user1: Not really actually.
user1: How about you?
user2: I'm not a big fan of biopics, honestly
user2: But I am a bit of a Computer Science nerd, so I thought that the movie would be very interesting
user1: Right on.  I thought it was really tragic when Christopher died in the beginning of the movie.
user1: Yea I am a huge tech fan, so I definitely enjoyed that element of it.
user1: Had you heard of the Enigma machine before seeing this movie?
user2: It reminded me a bit of a Beautiful Mind. Have you seen that? It's about a schizophrenic mathematician.
user2: I had not
user1: Yea me neither.
user1: Yes I have seen that.
user2: What did you think of him naming the machine after Christopher?
user1: I forgot that Alan named the machine Christopher.  I thought that was touching.
user2: I agree. But at the same time, it almost felt like he couldn't get over him. Like his newest obsession was named after somebody he still longed for.
user1: Yea for sure.  It was like his way of holding on to something that wasn't there.
user2: How did you feel about the scene where he shuns Keira's character, Joan?
user2: That is, when he tells her that he is gay and never loved her.
user1: I felt really bad for his wife in that scene.
user1: I felt bad for her overall for the whole situation.  I cannot imagine what that must have been like.
user2: I felt ambivalent about it. On one hand, it was almost like it was society's fault for making him pretend to be straight, but on the other hand, he didn't have to lie to her like that.
user2: I can't imagine that happening to me. It would be heart-wrenching
user1: I know, it was such a tricky situation for him to be in.
user1: It must have been so hard to live in a society that was so harsh about his sexuality.
user1: Especially being such a public figure.
user1: And the ending was so sad the way the government treated him.
user2: Oh yeah. Do you think he killed himself?
user2: Or do you think that it was the chemical castration?
user1: Yea I do.  Plus the other workers too, never being able to see each other again.  Talk about a bittersweet ending.
user2: It really makes you appreciate that there hasn't been such a ware in 70 or so years.
user2: *war
user1: Yea for sure.

conversation:
user2: The movie is called The Imitation Game, a drama that received a score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Nice, what is the movie about?
user2: Have you heard of this movie?  It is about a cryptanalyst named Alan Turing who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during WW2.
user1: I have not heard about it. If sounds like it would be a good movie. I already like the plot of the movie. Who plays in it? 
user2: This movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander and Tom Goodman-Hill as Sgt. Staehl - in all honesty I don't think I have heard of any of them haha.
user1: I have heard of Keira Knightley, I liked the Disney Pirate moves with Jack Sparrow. She played in all the movies. Good actress. I am surprised you have not heard of her. 
user2: I have seen the movies, other than Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom I probably couldn't name the rest of the cast.
user2: The Imitation Game received great reviews from critics and a CinemaScore of A+
user1: I do not think I can either, I would need to google them just to see who they are and what they have been in the past. I hope they put together a good cast and crew for this movie. 
user1: that is nice, that gives me hope that it will be good. 
user2: The Imitation Game is directed by Morten Tyldum, are you familiar with any of his other movies?
user1: I dont think so, what else has he produced? 
user2: I honestly have no idea...  
user2: I'm sorry, this is taking too long to progress to the next one I'm going to return this HIT.
user1: Another item we would have to google to look up. 

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: hi
user2: did you like the movie?
user1: I haven't seen it but I like Keira Knightley and a lot of my friends are fans of Benedict CUmberbatch (although I've never seen his stuff before), so I'm assuming it's a decent movie.
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user1: Most of the reviews look good, except for the last two.
user2: I've heard of it but have never seen it. I happen to like Keira knightly too. Her and Matthew Goode are the only familiar ones to me.
user1: Nice, what else is Mathew Goode in?
user2: No clue off top lol. The name is just familiar lmao. Did you see the movie that its based on?
user1: No I have not. I did not realize it was based on another movie.
user2: apparently its based on another one. Wait do you have another document yet? or is it still just the one?
user1: Yeah I just saw the new document
user1: Wow this is deep and sad
user1: That's a pretty intense way to start the movie, I'm hooked.
user2: these don't show much information about the film. I'm honestly still confused on what the movie is even about
user2: you must have better documents than me lol
user1: I'm looking at Key Scene 1
user1: I'm referring to Turing's feelings for Morcom
user2: I don't have that one yet
user1: it's on the top of the document :)
user2: ohh okay I see. I think it's because of the 3 response thing lol
user2: wow that is really sad
user2: poor turing
user1: I feel bad that he has to hide his homosexuality. I also feel bad for Clarke for being in a loveless marriage.
user1: I've actually never seen homosexuality explored in a historical film and it makes me happy that this film does that.
user1: Also, these descriptions about decryption and cyptographers are making it hard for me to understand the processes that are actually taking place. I'm sure it would be easier to understand while actually watching the film. 
user2: right?? I can't believe his love died. I'm actually super interested in seeing the film now
user1: Me too
user1: So he does care for Clarke. That's cute. But also this is getting super dramatic.
user1: What are your thoughts?
user1: Are you there
user2: im here
user1: What are your thoughts
user2: who is Clarke?
user1: Keira Knightley
user1: Turing's wife
user2: my document just kind of mentions the name but never says who that is
user2: i was confused lol
user1: It's under the Cast section
user1: Do you have any thoughts about Scene 3?
user2: I think its messed up that they threatened to out him
user2: what a position to put somebody in
user1: They pretty much ruined his life. Or that's what it seems like at this point
user1: I wonder what happens next
user1: I think we're done
user1: It says we're at the end of the document
user1: Goodbye
user2: bye

conversation:
user1: I don't see a paragraph about a movie. Is anyone else in here?
user2: Hi! Have you seen the movie The Imitation Game?
user1: I haven't. What's that about?
user2: It's a 2014 American historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst Alan Turing.
user2: Do you like biopics? If you do this movie might interest you.
user1: It sounds interesting. What does Alan Turing do?
user2: He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. 
user2: It has 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and average 7.7/10 and a Metacritic Score of 73/100. What ratings does a movie have to have for you to watch it? Or do you not consider ratings when deciding to watcha movie?

conversation:
user2: Do you think the movie have a great cast?
user1: Yes, but I don't like those actors. 
user1: Have you watched the movie?
user2: No- I haven't but I am interested now
user1: Do you like the actors?
user2: I do like Benedict Cumberbatch the most- because of Doctor Strange
user2: Don't care for the other actors
user2: Do you think the movie have a good rating?
user1: Yes, based on the ratings it should be good and interesting
user2: It seems all the scores are high which I do base some of my movie watch off of. 
user2: Do movie reviews matter to you?
user1: I don't really care about what critics say about movies because i noticed sometimes they say bad things about great movies and great things about bad movies

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hi
user1: The imitation game is a great movie

conversation:
user1: The Imitation Game got some really good scores from people!
user2: Don't think I've heard about it, what is it about?
user1: It is about cracking a code during WWII
user1: Do you generally like movies set during World War 2?

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi.  It told me to read this page first so I'll be just a minute.
user1: Okay done reading.  Is anyone there?
user1: Welp I hope I still get paid for this because I read the directions, read the movie description and am waiting here to chat I was directed to do.
user1: The other person back out I am still here wasting my time so I hope that whoever checks this over is willing to pay me for holding up my end of the bargin.  Aborting conversation in a min if yall don't send me someone new to chat with.
user1: Other participant left the conversation early.  

conversation:
user1: Hey, did you see Morten Tyldum's new film?
user1: The recent one from 2014.
user2: Yes its loosely based on the bigraphy of Alan turing.
user1: I don't usually like biopics but Imitation Game was pretty good!
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch was a knockout in that role!
user1: What did you think of Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke?
user2: Benedict Cumberbatch was great I agree
user2: Keira Knightly was great in this thriller.
user2: I love movies based during ww2
user1: Agreed.  Even though some people felt they took too much artistic license, I still thought they did a good job capturing Turing's bravery.
user2: Yes it did take liberties with its source material
user1: It did but you cannot deny that it's pretty undeniably strong in its portrayal of Turing.
user2: Yes and the code decryption scenes were intense.
user2: The BBC drama Breaking the code also touches on the subject of this movie.
user2: I believe its an instant classic.
user1: Yeah, it did get a lot of critical acclaim and was being hailed as one of the greatest movies of 2014.
user1: The scene where Christopher dies before Alan can tell him he loves him broke my heart!
user2: The scenes from Turing's boarding school were great
user2: So sad his friend died.
user1: Yeah, it's crazy to think all that happened in the 1920s.
user2: The Enigma machine is something  alright. s
user1: So many cryptographers working to crack a code.  It's impressive.
user1: It is sweet he named his machine after Christopher.  That's love right there.
user2: I was surprised Turing proposed to Clarke to keep her working with him.
user1: It must have been so hard keeping his homosexuality a secret.
user2: Yes for sure at that time it had to be kept secret.
user1: Definitely.  There were a lot of secrets to keep - especially about having cracked the code.\
user2: Must have been hard to not act on some of the information they decoded in oorder not to tip off the Nazis.
user1: Yeah and to think that Cairncross was a Soviet Spy!! I did not see that coming!
user2: Right and him threatening to tell people about Turrng's homosexuality was low.
user1: It was.  And it didn't even matter in the end!  Menzes already knew and was working with him!
user2: I felt sorry for Clarke when Turing sent her away and told her he was gay.
user1: He was just trying to keep her safe.
user2: they had to destroy all thier work  after the war it must have been terrible
user1: I bet they didn't think history would remember them and their work.
user2: I agree They made history.

conversation:
user2: What did you think of the movie?
user1: I really liked The Imitation Game, although I agree with Mr. Grant that no artistic license was needed as Mr. Turing's life is already so intriguing.
user2: Do you have a favorite actor/ actress that was in the movie? I like Keira Knightly.
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch is always a delight to watch.  Plus his name is quite fun.  Do you usually enjoy dramas?
user2: I prefer something that is a little more comedic, but I also enjoy dramas.
user1: I look forward to viewing more of Morten Tyldum's work.
user2: Same here.
user2: Do you like true to life stories?
user1: Why yes I do!  The closer to the real story the better, although a thrilling adventure is never bad either.  Do you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes score?
user2: I totally agree about it being closer to the real story. It is nice to add some artistic value to the story but not so much that it takes away from the story. I think the rotten tomatoes score is Okay. It may have been higher if it was closer to the real story. What do you think?
user1: I think more truth would have lowered the score.  Unfortunately, people seem to want action more than truth.  But perhaps The Imitation Game found a good balance.
user2: Did you see this at the movie theater?
user1: I did not.  Did you realized the beginning of the movie took place in 1951?  How old would that have make Mr. Turing?
user1: I would assume mid to late thirties, perhaps.
user2: I did not realize that. Yes I would agree mid- to late thirties.
user1: I wonder if, had Mr. Turing not been bullied, he and Mr. Morcom would still have become such close friends?
user2: It is hard to imagine being sent away to boarding school, being away from your family and dealing with being bullied.
user1: I completely agree.  I believe there is good in most situations.  The good out of this one is of course Enigma.
user2: And to deal with our sexuality at a time when it was so taboo.
user1: Indeed. How wonderful Mr. Turing must have felt having the support from his colleagues.  They would not hear of Mr. Turing's dismissal!
user1: Mr. Turing and Miss Clarke seem to have found a mutually beneficial relationship in the end: he would not be lonely and she would be free of her parents.
user2: I agree.
user1: I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to choose with decoded attacks to allow and which to stop.
user2: I wonder how it was that they were so strong to stand behind Turing.
user2: Clarke must have been heartbroken to learn Turing never cared for her.
user1: What a twist at the end... Mr. Cairncross being discovered as a spy, but Mr. Menzies knowing about it the whole time!  Mr. Turing risking it all to protect Miss Clarke... she must have know he was lying to her about not caring for her after that.
user1: Perhaps, though, she never knew of his sacrifice.
user2: He had to have cared for her to risk what he did.
user1: Sometimes we don't realize just how much someone cares for us.  And sometimes we never will.
user2: I think many people hide behind a facade because they are afraid they will get hurt.
user1: She must have cared for him in return since she did not turn him over to the police for his homosexuality.
user1: All in all, great movie.
user2: Agreed

user2: hi
user1: hello
user1: this is very highly rated movie. everyone likes it

user1: i believe it is a incredible movie with great actors
user2: DIRECTED THIS FILM VERY GOOD BY MORTEN TYLDUM
user1: i agree. not to mention the actors did a great job doing their roles. the reviews are great so it is not surprising.
user2: THE STORIES IS 2ND WORLD WAR INTELLIGENCE CODES WHO DECRYPTED?
user1: they decrypted german intelligence codes i believe
user2: THE REPORTER SAYS THIS FILM WAS CUMBERBATCH I AGREE THIS
user1: yeah he starred in the film and did a great job with his portrayal of the character. as a matter of fact, the rest of the cast was great too
user2: THE MOVE IS VERY STRONG IN ITS SCENE VERY BRIGHT SCREEN PLAY 
user2: ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE MOVE IN 2014 
user1: yeah it is. it also great its from a real life story and also stage play.
user2: I LIKE WAR MOVIES, I LIKE THIS STORIES IS VERY INTERESTING.
user2: THE DIRECTOR ANALYZE THE HISTORY DIRECT FILM, THE WRITES GRAHAM MOORE IS WRITTEN SCRIPT VERY SUPERB 
user1: honestly i dont watch war films a often but this is one of the very few films that caught my interest. the storyline was amazing.
user1: the director did a great job and did his homework when directing it. i say this movie is of the best of its time.
user2: IN THIS FILM HAVE ANY DESCRIPTION FOR 2ND WORLD WAR BETWEEN GERMANY  AND BRITAIN
user1: the war as started by britain against germany in 1939.
user2: WHO IS ACTOR OF THIS FILM?
user2: MAIN HERO OF THIS FILM
user1: Benedict cumbernatch plays alan turing. kiera knightly is his love interest, i might add.
user2: MATTHEW GOODE AS A HUGH ALEXANDOR
user1: i will say this film also covers homosexuality, which were heavily forbidden in its time period.
user2: WHAT ABOUT THE CHRISTOPHER ROLE IN THIS FILM? 
user2: GERMANY PEOPLE LIKE THIS FILM
user1: It didnt take too long for turing to crack the code which made him a enemy in the eyes of germans.
user2: IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM
user1: yeah im quite sure germans loved this film
user1: what else you want to talk about regarding the movie?
user1: oh yeah he named his machine after his first love, christopher. how nice!
user2: I AM WILLING TO QUIT OUR DISCUSS,
user2: I DON'T KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS FILM
user1: Ok. Lets end it.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Have you see this movie?
user1: It has 91% Rotten tomatoes...which is pretty high.
user2: Yes, I did, I liked it a lot, and it does seem to have pretty good ratings
user1: Yes, I love Benedict Cumberbatch. He was perfect for the part!
user2: I can see it also has a CinemaScore of A+ which is pretty good
user2: And yeah, he is a great actor
user2: who else did you like
user1: Yeah, this movie deserves it. Very interesting movie.
user1: Keira Knightly was also in this movie...she's okay.
user2: I also liked her, and liked Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander
user2: Thought his role was  vital to the movie
user1: I agree.
user1: So this really happened in 1951?
user2: Did you like Tom Goodman?
user1: Who did he play?
user2: He played Sgt. Staehl
user1: Oh, I see yeah, he was good for the part.
user2: and according to critics reviews it happened but not in the way we watched it in the movie
user2: some things change as many hollywood movies
user1: True...
user1: It was interesting how he named the machine Christopher. It's my son's name.
user2: Yeah, that was an interesting part of the movie, what was your favorite scene?
user1: It's hard to say as the story keeps on developing and the character keep on changing. Especially the main character. The whole thing was very interesting.
user2: I liked the one when Turing discovers that Caimcross is a soviet spy, that scene was really revealing and well acted.
user2: But I agree, the whole movie plot is interesting
user1: Sad that his friend Christopher, not the machine, died. As he didn't really have friends...
user2: Yeah, it is sad, I almost cried in that part, really got to me
user1: Yeah, I did like that part about Turing discovering the spy...
user1: I know!!
user2: I liked the director of the movie as well
user2: He did a great job 
user1: It was directed my Morten Tyldum...I am not familiar with him.

conversation:
user1: Hello. What did you think of the choice of Benedict Cumberbatch to portray Alan Turing?
user2: I never heard of Alan Turing before.
user1: So then it was probably hard to make a good assessment of his portrayal then. I thought he did a reasonable job, but I have never thought he was an actor with a wide array of emotional capability.
user2: I am interested in the movie after reading the document.
user2: Is Cuberbatch a British actor?
user1: It is an enjoyable movie that is worth watching. It certainly depicts a unique angle of the struggle for secrecy during World War 2.
user1: Yes. I believe you are correct that he was born in Britain.
user2: I need to watch the movie.  
user1: If you like historical documentary-type movies, then you'd enjoy this one.
user2: I like WWII movies.
user1: Don't we all? I know I do as well.
user1: The only part of the movie I did not enjoy was the depth they went into to show his personal life. I thought it took away from the intellectual focus of the movie to decode the German ENIGMA machine.
user2: I watched a WWII movie in the past - it was non fiction.  It was interesting.  The title had the word "needle".  Do you know the full title?
user2: It was about a German spy who killed people using a needle.
user1: Is it called Eye of the Needle, maybe?
user2: Yes.  I also red the novel.
user1: I have never seen it, but it sounds like the movie you are describing.
user2: I meant "read"
user2: I am not a good typist.
user1: Oh, I did not know it was based on a novel. There is never a guarantee those movies will turn out well.
user1: Sadly some Steven King and other novelist movies have really good books that turn into poor movies.
user1: There was one with Johnny Depp that was based on a Steven King movie that I did not like at all.
user1: Do you know the one I'm talking about?
user2: Please tell me more about the movie as mentioned on the document provided to us.
user2: No, to your previous question.
user1: Sure. The movie does a series of transitions that flash back to various points in his life to show what led up to the work he was doing in World War 2.
user2: When are we supposed to end the conversation?  My hit is going to expired.
user1: So you get an idea of why he was so determined and unwavering in his effort to get his decoding machine to work.
user2: Was he considered a war hero?
user1: I think we have chatted long enough to meet the requirements.
user2: The"finish conversation" is not active though.
user1: Same for me.
user1: I forgot to mention that the movie also has some elements of spycraft in it. I had forgotten about that at first. That one of his teammembers is supplying information to the Soviets
user2: It is not much we can talk about based on the document alone.  We were instructed not to use other sources.
user1: Right. Although the finish conversation button appears active now.
user2: Okay then.  I guess we can leave now.  Thank you so much for the info. I will watch the movie.
user1: Yes. Hopefully you enjoy it.
user2: bye

conversation:
user2: Hi, so what's the name of the movie we're supposed to talk about?
user1: Imitation Game 2014
user2: Cool. What kind of film is it?
user1: WW2 thriller. Have you seen?
user2: I have, but we can't use info we know outside the experiment. :-)
user2: Does it sound like it's any good?
user1: OK, The director was pretty accurate in the film. Morten Tyldum
user2: Who is in it?
user1: The film has Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing
user2: I like him. Good actor. 
user1: Also his gal is Keira Knightley.
user1: Everyone in it was very convincing.
user2: I used to NOT like her as an actress, but she's gotten really good. 
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: Pratice make perfect I suppose.
user1: I have seen it a couple times now.
user2: So, WWII thriller. 
user1: A sort of thriller. More a drama I think.
user2: Not sure how much to ask given the rules.
user2: Is it out on Netflix?
user1: I expect it is Netflixed someplace
user1: I saw it on dvd years ago.
user2: Really? I didn't think it had been out that long. Maybe 3 years.
user1: The coolest part was when he is figureing out the nazi enigmation machine and reverse engineering it.
user2: LOL wondering how long we are supposed to talk about this. It said there would be 2 more movies.
user1: 2014
user2: Yeah that sounds really interesting.
user1: I dont have anything on other films
user1: One of Turnings co workers was a spy too.
user2: Well, I love movies about WWII. Unless they're war movies. Actual battle type movies tend to bore me.
user1: I know what you mean. This film was ifferent
user2: Wow, I didn't know that. I wonder if they added that to make it more interesting.
user2: About the spy I mean.
user1: The film was supposed to be very accurate.
user2: I'll have to check it out.
user1: Good idea. I amn sure you will like it.
user2: Do you know if it was filmed at the actual location? 
user2: Oh, we can finish the conversation now. LOL
user1: OK I am ready to.
user1: Filmed in USA I think

conversation:
user1: Tell me about the movie you read about
user2: The move was called The Imitation Game.
user1: I've heard of that.  What is it about?
user2: It's a historical drama based on the biography of Alan Turing, a cryptanalyst.
user1: Cool.  Do you know what time period it is set in?
user2: The 40's, during WW2.
user1: Do you know who stars in the movie?
user2: Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing.
user1: Solid.  Any other famous people in leading roles?
user2: Keira Knightley is Joan Clarke.  The other two actors, Matthew Goode and Tom Goodman-Hill, I've never heard of.
user1: Keira Knightley is one of my favorites.
user1: Do you know if it stays pretty true to the real story?
user2: It claims it is "loosely based" on Turing's life, so it may not be terribly accurate.
user1: How long is it?
user2: I'm not sure, maybe around 2 hours.
user1: Good.  I prefer movies to be 2 hours or less.  What did you find most interesting about the movie?
user2: I find the code-cracking to be very interesting in itself.  The story itself was also dramatic and compelling.
user1: Very good.  Where was Turing from?
user2: He was British.
user1: So he was presumably fighting against the Nazis?
user2: Yes.  He created a machine, named Christopher, that would break Germany's enigma code.
user1: Wow, that's awesome.  Is there a love story between Turing and the character played by Knightley?
user2: Yes, Turing proposes to her, but it is revealed that he is actually a homosexual.
user1: Quite a twist
user1: Is she involved with the decoding?
user2: No, she is just there for Turing, but near the end of the film he makes her leave for her own safety, and confesses his homosexuality to her.
user1: Is the movie set in Britain? 
user2: Yes, at Bletchley Park.
user1: Never heard of it.
user1: Does Churchill appear in the movie?
user2: No, I don't think so.  It is mostly the cryptographers at Bletchley Park.

user1: *psst, we're supposed to pretend we've seen it*
user2: ohh yes
user1: Do you think the Rotten Tomatoes rating is fair?
user2: yes
user2: its fine
user1: I thought it definitely deserved to be Certified Fresh, so I was happy to hear about the high ratings from RT and CinemaScore
user2: am too happy
user1: I loved the story, Morten Tyldum puts on a great show, and he's stellar when it comes to Dramas and biopics.
user2: yeah absalutly
user1: What was your favorite scene from the movie?
user2: fight scene
user1: ahh, yes, when Turing is being bullied at school. I think that was a main turning point for the story.
user2: yes turning point  ...is hightlight the story
user2: this flim american historical drama film....so nice script
user1: The script is definitely top notch. My favorite part is when they finally crack the Enigma machine, but can't save all the lives, or the Germans will realize what he's done
user2: yes sad of the end. but script right choice
user2: end of the script very impress
user1: My Favorite actor was Benedict Cumberbatch. His acting skills are great!
user2: me too 
user2: Benedict cumberbatc ....SO GOOD ACTING I LOVE THAT
user1: He makes you feel like the story is actually happening right there in front of you
user2: YES AFCORSE
user1: This movie was based on the BBC TV Show called Breaking the Code. I've never seen it before, but this movie makes me want to watch it.
user2: OHH THIS IMPERMATION IS NEW ONE FOR ME....BUT IAM IMPRESS THIS FILM
user1: Yes, me too. What I like is that it's based on a true story. All of the characters were real people, and the Enigma machine was a real thing.
user2: YEAH ITS VERY TRULY STORY ........PUBLIC ENJOY THE STORY IN CINEMA
user1: I loved it in the cinema too. I was so worried in the scene where they weren't sure if they could get the decoding machine to work or not. So suspenseful!
user2: APRECIATE THE DIRECTOR .TECHINICAL WRK OUT ASSAAM
user1: Yes, the scenes he made kept me at the edge of my seat for the whole movie. Especially Turing reveals that he is gay.
user2: THE MESSAGE IS USEFULL ....THANKS TO DIRECTOR

conversation:
user1: hey whats up
user2: hey!
user1: ever see the movie Jaws?
user2: no, what's it about?
user1: I was not alive when it first came out but i saw it on tv in the 90s
user2: did you watch the movie?
user1: I think it is cool and to me is seeemed to spawn a whole lot of funny and wacky knock offs
user1: yup i watch it
user2: that's cool!
user1: fun fact it got a 90% on RT
user2: it did? 90% is good or bad on the rating scale for Rotten Totamtoes? 
user1: good
user2: ok, i was wondering how the rating system worked?
user2: so they had a very good rating. at 90%
user1: also ever heard of a flick called the imitation game that was made in 2014
user1: yup
user2: i think so?
user2: do it have michael douglas, in it?
user1: it was a type of drama that was based on a biography by allen turner
user2: so it's suppose to be a true story?
user1: I dont think so but i do think one of the guys looks liek him
user2: ha ha! i think you told a joke!?
user1: well with hollywood i'm sure they added some things to make it a little more crazy and fun to watch
user2: yep, i'm sure they did. Lol
user1: :)
user2: lol
user2: what's your favorite movie?
user1: well my favorite movie is t2
user2: what is that movie about? never heard of it? is that short for something?
user1: toh sorry i mean termanitor 2
user1: i'll be back lol
user2: oh, okay. lol
user1: what about you what movie is you fav?
user2: what's the most interesting part in the movie?
user1: the part where the metal skeleton of the robot is burn looking like death clad in metal
user2: I like all kinds of movies... I recently watched the Greatest Showman, and I really enjoyed it
user1: oh really what was it about
user2: oh, i see
user2: it's about the uprise of the Wringling Brothers & Barnum Bailey Circus
user1: oh so a type of doc. like movie?
user2: It has a lot of cool acrobatic stunts, and it moves at a good pace. 
user1: cool i think i saw a preview for it
user2: no it was a fictional movie, based on this topic
user1: oh ok
user2: loosely based on this topic
user1: got to love the work loosely it lets you get away with so much stuff.
user2: yeah, but people tend to forget about loosely based on someone's life.. when watching it. Therefore, it can be very harmful and damaging to another if someone was to make a loosely based story about their life

conversation:
user2: I have never seen this movie, sounds interesting though.
user1: Yes, I've heard it's very good!
user1: Do you think Benedict Cumberbatch was a good choice for the role?

conversation:
user2: i is anyone there?
user1: You should really check out The Imitation Game.
user2: What's that about?
user1: Its about how Alan Turing decrypted German intelligence messages during the second world war.
user2: sounds interesting, who plays Turing?
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch plays Turing, and some other notable stars are in the supporting cast.
user2: He's pretty good, Turing had his reputation ruined and was not given credit until recently for cracking the enigma code because he was gay, does the movie address this at all
user1: not sure, some critical responses say that the movie takes liberties with the source work
user2: That's the problem with a lot of these modern films, the narrow sighted studios like to rewrite history to fit what they think sounds better
user1: You should check it out and see. Its a fun thriller as a stand alone movie.
user2: I suppose as long as you don't use it to learn about a pivotal moment in history :)
user1: Turing recounts his work at Bletchley Park
user2: Did they film at Bletchley Park do you know
user1: I don't know. But I know that some of the movie covers how Turing was bullied during attendance at a boarding school and how this leads to a friendship that gets him interested in cryptography.
user2: Well he was a brilliant mathematician, probably was bullied :)
user2: I wonder if they rewrote the supporting cast too
user2: Does it mention the Turing test at all?
user1: The supporting cast has Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke and Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander, along with Tom Goodman-hill as Sgt. Staehl. 
user2: Hmm, do you know from the movie what the Turing test is?
user1: Turing's machine is a big focus. Specifically its roll in helping decrypt Enigma
user2: I see, but let me ask again, does it give credit to the Turing test?
user1: I'm not sure, as the movie is really focussed on the wwii happenings
user2: exactly, I suspect someone here is failing the Turing test, as there are only two of us here and it's not me could you guess who I might be refering to?
user1: let me see if I can give you more information on this movie instead of talking about the turing test. It was decently scored on rotten tomatoes and metacritic, and got an A+ on Cinemascore.
user2: By the way, I plan to rent the movie this weekend, sounds like a fun movie, I'll just suspend belief for a couple of hours :)
user2: Hey it's been really nice chatting with you, love to continue but I have to get back to work
user1: One of the dramatic moments in the film is when Turing discovers that Caimcross is actually a Soviet Spy. Hope that isn't too much of a spoiler
user2: By for now!
user1: Take care, and I hope you enjoy watching the movie.
user2: Cheers!
user2: Any idea where I get my completion code in this task?
user1: After the wwii ends the cryptographers in their movie have to destroy all their work so that it can't be used by any one ever again. hopefully that didn't happen to the survey code.

user2: Yes this two character is an brothers

conversation:
user1: hi there
user2: Hello! Alright, the movie is The Imitation game
user1: What is the movie about?
user1: Sounds like a fantasy
user2: It's loosely based on the biography of Alan Turing. So Benedict Cumberbatch is being a British Cryptanalyyst, Alan Turing.
user1: when did this take place?
user2: He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the british government, during World War II
user1: wow, so he played a major role in the war
user2: It's pretty highly rated, Rotten tomatoes gives it a 91%.
user1: sounds like it did really well
user2: It did. It also has Keira Knightley in it.
user1: so he worked in a team of other cryptanalyst? 
user2: Yes, the team decrypts the Enigma Machine, which nazis used for coded messages, which sounds weird
user2: Like that sounds like a sci-fi thin, Enigma Machine.
user1: he must of been well awarded at the end of the war for his efforts
user2: I don't know that he was, I don't have that information. Maybe not though, as he was gay in a time period where that was not well liked.
user2: He has a romantic crush on a friend from boarding school, but that guy dies of tuberculosis before Turing can confess his love.
user1: you haven't seen it?
user1: it definitely sounds like a fascinating movie with a good storyline
user2: Yeah, I think so. The sad part is Turing realizes that they can't act on every single message, or they nazis will know that the code is broken.
user2: It's a hard call.
user1: sounds like a great movie
user1: love the history aspect of it
user2: It takes a few artistic liberties, but still a great watch. CinemaScore gave it an A+
user1: sounds like a very solid choice then
user1: thanks for your feedback
user2: No problem!
user1: is there anything else that i should know about the movie?
user2: Hm, well, there is the scene where one person is a spy, and blackmails Turing from telling with the information that he's gay. 
user2: After the war, they make the cryptographers destroy their work, too. Sad.
user1: ah, so he was gay in a tough time to be open about it
user1: lots of lost information, but at least they put the topic out there, thanks again!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello! The movie is called the imitation game and stars Benedict Cumberbatch.
user1: Awesome. What is it about? 
user2: It is about a British cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes.
user1: Is it pretty similar to James Bond? 
user2: I am not sure about that, but it takes place during world war 2.
user1: Decryption was hard back then. What do you like about the movie?
user2: I have not seen the movie myself but I like that it is a thriller.
user1: Yeah sounds pretty interesting. Do you know any other actors that star in the movie? 
user2: Keira knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory kinnear, 
user1: I love their movies! Any similar movies you may like starring them? 
user2: I do not know any movies starring those actors. The main character is trying to decrypt the Enigma machine which the Nazis used to send coded messages.
user1: Did he decrypt it successfully? 
user2: Yes he was successful 
user1: Was he faced with any challenges? Or were there enemies out to get him? 
user2: I am not sure. He developed feelings for another man at boarding school but his friend passed away from tuberculosis
user1: Was he heartbroken after that? 
user2: Yes he was very heartbroken.  He never got to confess his love for him. 
user1: That's sad. Did anyone else know about his love? 
user2: Nobody else knew. But he named his machine Christopher, after his friend.
user1: Do you think Christopher was the reason why he was able to decrypt the machine? 
user2: He had an epiphany, and realized he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages.
user1: What did the messages convey? 
user2: I am not sure what the messages said.
user1: Do you think it was a good message? 
user2: No, they were probably not.
user1: Did someone want to get the machine back from him? 
user2: A Soviet spy tried to trick him into telling about his machine

conversation:
user1: Hi.
user1: Which movie are we talking about today?
user2: Hello. How do you feel about dramas? I hear The Imitation Game is a great drama.
user1: I feel okay about dramas.  I like to watch them with another person.
user1: Who is in the Imitation Game?
user2: This would be a good one for movie night, then! It’s based on real historical events. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a British man who decrypts German intelligence codes during WWII.
user2: Kiera Knightly is also in it
user1: Wow, I think I saw the trailer for that awhile back.  Was he gay in that movie?
user2: You’ll have to watch it to find out the dirty details!
user2: Details*
user1: Okay.  
user2: Cool! 
user1: Well it would be good to watch with your LGBT relatives or friends.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi
user1: seen any good movies
user2: I went and saw a movie called "the imitation game" it is based on true events, but I dont think so
user1: Oh really the title sounds interesting.  why do you thing it is not based on true evnts??
user2: Looking at the reviews it seems like it takes liberties with the actual story that happened in history. It got mixed reviews, but what did it for me was hearing Andrew Grant a writer for Science News said that it really deviates from the actual true story. You know how Hollywood makes things more dramatic. I wouldnt go see it unless it is for the entertainment value. 
user1: ok good to know what is the plot about?
user2: its based on a real life British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted German intelligence codes during the World War 2.
user1: ok what was your favortite part
user2: I didn't have a favorite part. I wouldn't recommend it.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi there!
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: No I have not
user1: Have you?
user2: Nope.
user2: But I do like Keira Knightley so I would probably check it out.
user1: Yea she was great before, I haven't seen her recent movies
user2: I don't recognize any of the other characters from their name.
user1: It's a war movie right?
user2: Yea I think it was a WW2 movie
user1: I don't think I watched it because I'm tired of war movies haha
user2: Yeah I'm kind of over them too.
user2: You can only do so many Nazi movies
user1: I did want to watch Dunkirk though ONLY because it was by Nolan
user1: Still haven't watched it yet though
user2: I haven't seen that one either. I'm so bad with keeping up with movies.
user1: Do you know anything about Turing?
user2: Not at all. But apparently he was gay.
user2: I like that the encryption machine has a name.
user1: I have heard of something called the Turing test
user1: I think it's used to check how good AI is
user2: Oh really? That sounds kind of interesting. Do you know how it works?
user1: I think if the robot can convince you that it is not a robot, it wins
user2: Interesting.
user2: I can't decide if this movie would be worth watching or not
user1: I don't think it is
user1: I wouldn't watch it even on Netflix
user2: Haha! Take that turing

conversation:
user1: It's too bad that they took so many liberties with Turing's story, because the real story is so fascinating. Nonetheless, ythe movie is very well made and very entertaining. 
user2: I agree, it was beautifully written and well performed.
user2: Cumberbatch especially was amazing as Turing.
user2: Do you generally like to watch historical drams?
user1: I had never seen Benedict Cumberbach before and thought he was particularly good at playing Turing and caught both the oddness of the scientist and also the tragedy of a gay man caught in a time when his homosexuality was still a crime. 
user1: Yes, I do like watching historical dramas. I went to a very bad private high school so my sense of history is very spotty. seeing movies like this help to fill in a lot of the gaps in my knowledge!
user1: I also thought the films was exceptionally well made inn terms of technique: cinematography, direction, script, etc. 
user2: Definitely. If you wanted to know more about Turing, it might be good to read the biography the movie was based on.
user1: Definitely. I used to work for a woman who was one of the inventors of the ADA programming language and she told me many fascinating stories about Turning. 
user2: That's really cool. If you want to find the book it's called Alan Turing: The Enigma, it's written by Andrew Hodges. I believe it was also made into a play.
user1: And I must say that Keira Knightly was not only a very attractive presence in the movie but also gave a very good performance!
user2: Who did she play again? I forgot. 
user1: She was the young woman who applied to work in the lab and then blew them away with her performance on the entry test. 
user2: It was really sad to see Christopher Morcom die so suddenly from tuberculosis. That scene was so hearbreaking. 
user1: Indeed. Hard to believe the movie was from 2014. Seems like I just saw it. When you are 60 years old, time seems to move so fast!
user2: Yeah, it got really good ratings though, some might even call it an "instant classic" so it just feels timeless.
user2: Plus the work done at Bletchley Park is always going to be fascinating. 
user1: Yes. I was recently reading that the actress Hedy Lamarr was actually one of the people who helped the U.S. crack the German codes. Fascinating! What a time to have lived in. 
user2: It must have been. I really liked how clever Turing was, not just in decoding but understanding that they cannot act on every decoded message or else the Germans would know that their codes were being broken.
user1: Those scenes really showed the filmmakers art. You could feel your pulse quickening as they were getting closer to breaking the code and you felt every disappointment when they failed. You really felt you were in the Park with them, a crucial participant in this historic moment. 
user2: Agreed! I couldn't believe how close Christopher was to being destroyed by Denniston. If it weren't for all the other cryptographers, Turing and his machine would be gone. 
user1: And we must comment on the ultimate tragedy of Turing life. Like so many other homosexuals in England at the time, it must have been unbearable having to hide who they were and worrying about revealing too much of themselves. It's not surprising so many of them died so tragically. 
user2: Yes, it must have been very difficult. I mean he is outright told to hide it, and he really only marries Clarke to keep her there since her parents wanted her to leave.
user1: Yes, the marriage of convenience. What a strange custom. But, of course, it still goes on. I know of several  in my town!
user2: But of course Caimcross, the man who told him to hide his secret has a secret of his own! 
user1: Do you know if the director has gone on to do anything else?  I'm not familiar with the name. What was Caimcross's secret? i don't remember.
user2: Caimcross was a Soviet spy. And when Turing confronts him on it, he threatens to reveal that Turing is a homosexual. 
user2: I don't know what else the director has done unfortunately.
user1: Ah, that's right. Thank you!
user1: I'm not sure what else I have to say about the film. 
user2: Well, do you usually watch movies with high critical ratings or do you generally not care? 
user2: It got a score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: Which is pretty good, if i must say so!
user1: Well, I generally look at the reviews in the New York Times, but I also go by my own instincts. We have a very good 8-screen independent cinema in our city so I get to see a lot of films that wouldn't show up at the regular chains. Plus my wife and I go to a week-long film festival held in Chatham, NY in October. That's where I saw this film. 
user1: Been great talking movies with you!

conversation:
user2: Movies based on WWII always seem to be pretty good.
user1: I agree and this one tells a story I never heard before
user2: Yeah. I didn't know much about Alan Turing before the movie. I didn't realize he played such an important role in world history.
user1: Benedict cumberbatch is good in all his movies so I would like to see this
user2: Yeah everyone seems to say he did a really good job.
user1: I do wonder why it's considered an American historical drama when it's based on a British person.
user2: I like how the one critic is surprised that a Hollywood movie exaggerated some things. Like what a shock!
user2: I guess because it was made in America?
user1: I think they have to exaggerate to make it interesting enough to keep people in seats for two or more hours.
user2: Yeah exactly. To keep it interesting.
user1: I guess I was questioning how they made it sound like it's American history. 
user2: So it's also kind of sort of a love story.
user1: Now I'm even more curious after reading about his crush.
user2: That is how they made it sound. I was thinking the same thing.
user1: The enigma machine sounds dreadful and exciting. I assume that wrote the codes for them.
user2: Anything called an Enigma machine has to be pretty cool. Even if it's Nazis who are using it.
user1: I didn't realize Britain declared war in 1939. I thought it all started officially a little later. I wonder how he was invited to the team.
user1: He sounds like he was analytical and very intelligent.
user2: He was extremely smart. Not so great with people, it seems though.
user1: Is that Rotten Tomatoes score a good thing or bad? It's a high number but so are the others.
user2: That's a really good score.
user2: I usually watch movies with a score of about 35% haha
user1: I can't imagine him having to hide being gay in those times. It's great he found someone to marry.
user2: That's crazy that he figured out not to decode every message knowing that the Germans would know. War is so much more than bloodshed.
user1: This part seems very disappointing. I hope a lot more happens than what sounds like in this summary.
user2: It's getting super involved. Turing lived a very complicated life.
user1: It's a shame he had to send his wife away and hurt her. I wonder why they would have to destroy their work if it helped the cause so much?
user2: That's what I'm wondering. It seems like there is a lot missing from that part of the summary.
user1: I hope there is more to it. This sounds so interesting and I'd love to watch it.
user2: Or I guess they already completed their work and they did't want it getting in the hands of their enemy?
user1: It says the war ended so Nazis had to be defeated. I would think they would want to develop it more. Maybe Menzies was worried it would compromise his own work.
user2: And yeah. What happens to Clarke? Do Turing and Clarke find happiness together? Does he live his true life at some point?
user1: It doesn't say. I'm curious about that too. We saw earlier it talks about him being questioned by police but no mention of her there.
user2: Yeah I don't know. This Menzies guy is bad news.
user2: Oh yeah. That was 1951. After all of this.
user1: I wonder what it means by Germans resetting Enigma each day. I'm very curious about that machine.
user2: The machine needs it's own standalone movie lol
user1: Is MI6 British? I wonder how the Soviet spy helped in the war.
user2: Yeah MI6 is British.
user1: I am wondering why Menzies threatened Clarke too. They don't elaborate on that and I hope it's in the movie.
user2: The Soviets are on the British side, at least eventually. I guess at this point they were still considered enemies.
user1: Do the people he worked with know he named his machine Christopher?
user2: Yeah. Menzies just pops up, there's not enough detail. Definitely need to watch the movie
user1: The machine he created is amazing.
user2: I don't know. I would think they would know that. The other people helped him with the machine.
user2: They just probably didn't know why he named it Christopher.
user1: I wonder if Clarke ever found out the truth about being threatened.
user1: I also wonder if he ever saw any of the other cryptographers. Who were they and why not mentioned much?
user2: Why was he telling the policemen about his work?
user2: Did they see something odd?
user2: Or no. Was his machine stolen?
user2: We need to know more about Clarke.
user1: Maybe he was lonely and wanted his story out. Maybe he thought the break in was related to his earlier work?
user2: Or I guess it's a good plot point to get the movie started.
user1: I wonder what happened to make Turing confront Carincross. It could have had something to do with that.
user2: I don't know. Probably once he found out he was a Soviet. He felt threatened that his work would fall into thr wrong hands.

conversation:
user1: Hi,
user2: Hi,  the name of the movie is,  The Imitation Game. 
user2: Have you seen it? 
user2: Well,  It's based on the real-life Alan Turing. Who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during the second World War. 

conversation:
user2: Have you seen the Immitation game
user1: No I haven't 
user1: I've heard of it. Have you seen it?
user2: I just watched it and its soooo good
user1: Critics seem to really like it too. I guess I need to watch it!
user2: you've got to really like historical stuff though
user2: do you like war movies? if you do you'd like it i think
user1: Ugh no I don't but it says it's about a cryptanalyst that decrypted intelligence codes and that sounds awesome to me
user1: I just don't like combat movies but spy movies are cool
user2: haha well the cast is good enough and its not too heavy on the whole war stuff. but it's good to go into the movie with a background or the audience would be pretty confused in this movie
user1: Looks like its also a love story. Of course. Typical movie formula
user1: 91% on rotten tomatoes is a pretty fantastic score
user2: i guess thats how they got such high ratings. they had to cater to everyone 
user2: but what else can you expect when they hired benedict cumberbatch as the lead role
user2: catering to all his fans probably hahaha
user1: Haha I like him! Yeah you're right
user1: Oh I just caught that it starts in 1951 and is told as flash-backs to the war
user2: yeah, its kind of a new take on the typical world war 2 movie
user1: Cool I think I may give this movie a shot!
user2: i really think you'll like it! It may not seem like your type of movie but the reviews dont lie! 
user1: I like Keira Knightley alright too in some stuff
user2: yeah keira is pretty versatile and it shows in this movie
user1: There is one critic second to last who really seemed to hate the movie haha
user1: and the last guy from Science News was "disappointed" but clearly majority of critics had good things to say
user2: yeah, but i feel like those people were expecting too much. 
user2: I think the Empire took it for what it was. just a form of entertainment
user1: Yeah it seems to be based on true events? If I am interpreting this correctly so whenever something really happened there will be criticisms like that. 
user1: The real life purists that don't enjoy a creative spin
user2: yeah judging by the synopsis, this story actually did happen
user1: but like you said they want to appeal to the widest audience
user2: exactly. critics like the second to last dont understand that this isnt a documentary
user1: right that's it. Annoying when they can't separate the two
user2: i wonder how much of those opinions affected the total ratings
user2: but the rotten tomatos rating is pretty high regardless
user1: True

user1: The movie title
user2: The Imitation Game
user1: What is it about?
user2: well it is a historical movie with a lot of drama
user1: What time period is it placed in?
user2: The Imitation Game is a 2014 American historical drama film directed by Morten Tyldum andwritten by Graham Moore, loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by AndrewHodges (which was previously adapted as the stage play and BBC drama Breaking the Code). Itstars Benedict Cumberbatch as real-life British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted Germanintelligence codes for the British government during the Second World War. Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Charles Dance and Mark Strong also star.
user1: Oh, thank you. I do like Benedict Cumberpatch. What did you think of it?
user2: i think he does  G
user2: A GOOD OB
user1: Does Keira Knightley play around the same character she does in Pirates of The Carribean?
user2: i really dont know
user1: Oh okay, do you have any other information on it?
user2: no
user1: Well what would you compare it to?
user1: Maybe a Sherlock Holmes type of vibe?
user2: well i actually have not see the movie
user2: so maybe you should search
user2: maybe
user1: Ohhh, okay. well I think you weren't supposed to give the entire paragraph at one time.
user1: So I was just trying to do what was asked of me.

user1: I don'
user1: I don't like his acting. The movie got a really good score on rotten tomatoes though.
user2: Yeah. I noticed that and I like dramas that deal with gov't and war.
user1: I like Keira Knightley. She is a good actress.
user2: Me too. She's pretty.
user1: I have never heard of the director Morten Tyldum
user2: Me neither. I've only heard of Knightley, who I loved in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World
user1: Me too
user2: Sorry, I don't think I'm allowed to mention that. Just read the task.
user1: The story looks pretty interesting
user2: I thought you weren't interested in it?
user1: I'm not, but the story is interesting
user2: Agree.
user1: Did you see the metacritic score of 73?
user2: Yeah, that's a good score I think. And i read some of the critic's reviews, seems highly rated.
user1: The CinemaScore of A+ is awesome. A lot of people must have really liked it
user2: Yeah, I am reading some of the reviews now.
user1: It looks like it is set in the 50'
user1: 's
user2: I wonder if they only used positive reviews though.
user1: That is a good point.Shall we say bye?
user2: Sure, if you want to.
user1: Yeah, it's time. Thanks for chatting. Bye

conversation:
user1: I don't think this movie sounds very good. It sounds like just another WW2 movie, doesn't seem to have any special qualities or interesting plot. What do you think?
user2: Well, I did like Benedict Cumberbatch's acting. However, it didn't seem to be true to the biography. It seems as though this happens pretty often in films. I was interested in the plot initially. What about you?
user1: The only thing I really like about this movie is Keira Knightley, great actress. I'm overall very interested in the World War 2 genre, but I feel that it's overdone. That's the problem I have with this film. It didn't seem to bring anything interesting or new to the genre. 
user2: I agree with your opinion on Keira Knightley. The cast was pretty well put together. My biggest problem with the genre is the inflated sense of conflict and action in most of the movies. I think the movie would have been better if the biopic had more closely mirrored the true story it is trying to portray.
user1: I concur. It's frustrating when you go and see a "based on a true story" and it is so far removed from the actual story, it might as well be a fiction movie. I really can't get into such movies, when I know they are given such artistic license. I also dislike Mathew Goode as an actor, and felt his acting fell flat in this movie. 
user2: I had actually never seen Matthew Goode before, but I agree. He certainly isn't one of my new favorites. While I do enjoy biopics, it's like you said: it is sometimes so far removed, it might as well be fiction. It often removes the sense of authenticity from the film.
user1: Yeah well he's really horrible. He looks like he smells. Dirty and ragged looking. I don't even know why hollywood deals with him anymore. I feel he single handedly destroyed this film. I can't imagine how Keira Knightley even stood near him honestly. 
user2: I can't speak to that, although that all sounds awful! Overall, the film was just underwhelming for me. I will try my hand at reading the biography, because the plot was interesting. It was all the extra fluff I didn't like.
user1: I agree, I was actually very surprised it got a 91% on rotten tomatoes. I wouldn't watch the film again if they paid me to. I'd rather dig out one of my own eyeballs with a spoon than watch it again. Seriously, if given the choice I'd choose the latter option. What about you would you rather watch the film again? Or maim yourself in some way?
user2: I would rather give it a terrible rating to lower the Rotten Tomatoes score. I have watched plenty of movies with "bad" ratings that have turned out to be very good. I am unsure how the system works, but this was a definite dud for me.
user1: Your avoiding the question. Would you rather watch the movie again, or dig your eye out with a spoon? I feel a very deep connection between us do you?
user2: I am unsure about that. It seemed a bit odd to me that Turing spent his entire life doing cryptography after discovering it was an interest of his first love. Although I suppose the passion could have been there for it all along, and it just took Christopher introducing him to it to spark a career interest.

user1: Have you watched this movie/
user1: I've never watched this movie but it looks interesting
user2: I think the story of The Imitation Game, about code decryption during World War II is interesting.

conversation:
user2: this movie sounds interesting
user1: I've seen that the movie was on Netflix and i think it was a great one.
user2: i like dramas the reviews are good i have never seen it

user2: Great and its a historical drama which is very interesting to me!
user1: I had no knowledge of Alan Turning before watching this actually 
user2: I don't know him at all.
user1: It gives a lot of history lessons in this movie as well
user2: I would like to learn about him after reading this. I like history.
user1: It takes place during the war with Germany, which is always intriguing to me 
user2: How interesting.  Wars are very intriguing.  Sounds entertaining
user1: I like that it got it such a good score on Rotten Tomatoes because I always look at the reviews on there. It deserved a great revew.
user1: And dramas are some of my favorite movies and like this one, it just engulfs you in it
user1: Do you ever choose movies by there ratings or reviews?
user1: This movie gives an insight into homosexuality as well
user1: I would happily recommend this to everyone.

user2: i mean are u heared about this
user2: it was released during 2014
user1: ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STORIES OF THE LAST CENTURY AND ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF 2014
user1: IT IS AN AMERICAN HISTORICAL DRAMA
user2: do you know about the director?
user1: MORTEN TYLDUM
user1: YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS WRITTEN BY?
user2: i think in this story two policemen were the main role
user2: rating also good in this movie
user1: REPORTER FROM SCIENCE NEWS EVEN WROTE AN ARTICAL
user2: wow great! i thnk the investigation is the main theme in the story
user1: YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD DANGEROUS TO DECRYPT CODES
user2: are you speaking about the story?
user2: in this story turing is a character which he built the machine called christopher. 
user1: HE DEVELOPS A RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRISTOPHER
user2: yeah., he admired 
user2: but he died because of tuberculosis
user1: HE PROPOSE MARRIAGE TO JOAN
user1: AND IT TURNED OUT HE WAS GAY!!! WHAT A JAW DROPPER
user2: yes.. he developed a machine in the name christopher.
user2: do you think that he planned for his marraige?

user1: I WOULD BELIEVE THAT THIS MOVIE WOULD BE FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTO KNOWING ABOUT SOVIETS AND THE BRITISH CONFLICTS
user1: I'AM INTERESTED TO SEE
user2: ya me too.

conversation:
user2: I just saw this movie called The Imitation game. It's really good. Benedict Cumberbatch is in it.
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: You're correct, I believe it was the best drama movie of 2014 .
user2: It has more than 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and a CinemaScore of A+, so lots of other people must have liked it too!
user1: Yes, I have. I watched it 3 times. It was very interesting getting to know more about Alan Turing and his life . 
user1: It was very compelling . 
user2: Yeah, very interesting character. His work on intelligence codes during WWII might have saved Britain. 
user1: That is correct, he was very brave . 
user1: The definition of a real solider. 
user2: Some people say that the movie takes too much artistic license - that it isn't true to life, but I don't know about that. 
user1: I'm not sure about that as well, all I know is that it's a superb movie. It should've won an Oscar 
user2: Yeah! Definitely for acting. Keira Knightly was very good as well as Cumberbatch. 
user1: Yes, she's a great actress . I feel like her role played a huge part in the success of the  film. 
user2: When Turing's almost-boyfriend died I was so sad. He never was a really happy guy. Things were different back then.
user1: Yes, times were hard back then. So much war and hatred. 
user2: The Nazi's enigma machine was amazing. So impressive that they were able to decode it.
user1: Yes, you are correct. Hitler was in his prime around those times. This single handedly destroyed the Nazi regime. 
user2: Things would have been very bad if the Nazis won. When Britain entered the war in 1939 code breaking became very important.
user1: I know, Jewish people would've been extinct. Also, code breaking played a huge part in the past & is still effective up to this day. 
user2: It's amazing that the Brits couldn't act on all the decoded messages, so they wouldn't give away that they broke the code. It must have been so hard not to reveal some of those messages.
user1: Yes but it was for the greater good of the nations. The movie showed this . 
user1: I give it a 10/10
user2: That's very true. Those men and women had to make hard decisions. 
user2: It's cool that all the other cryptographers had Turing's back, even when their superior wanted to fire him.
user1: I agree, if it wasn't for them and his strategy. I don't know what would've happened to us . 
user2: It's one of those amazing situations where Turing was at the right place at the right time - if he hadn't heard that clerk talking, he may never have cracked enigma.
user1: True, he was alert and observant . You had to possess these qualities around those times. 
user2: The crypographers couldn't see or speak to each other after the war. That must have been sad, they were so close. 
user1: They were the real MVPs .
user2: Truly. It's good that Turing has been recognized as a hero now, since he was so mistreated for being gay during his life.
user1: Yes, it must've been 10x harder for him to live during those times. Homosexual or not, we can all be heroes. 
user1:  He's a big example of that. 
user2: That's right. It was a great example.

conversation:
user1: Hello, Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent as Alan Turing, dont you agree?
user2: Hello! Yes, agreed. I thought Keira Knightley also did fantastic as Joan Clarke. 
user2: The movie did a really good job informing us of the historical time period, right?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Anybody  here?
user1: hello!
user2: hi
user2: Would you like to talk about imitation game?
user1: yes!
user2: Have you veer seen it?
user2: oh, did youleave ?

conversation:
user2: The Imitation Game is a gripping drama about World War 2.
user1: Indeed, and it seems to have been received well judging by the scores it received from CinemaScore and MetaCritic.
user2: The reviews are well earned. Benedict Cumberbatch really sells his role as Alan Turing and draws the viewer in.
user1: I agree, and judging by the critical responses, it seems people would agree that Cumberbatch's performance is the lynchpin of the piece. He is received well when portraying historical figures.
user2: Keira Knightly is another big name star that performs well in The Imitation Game. Their charm and eagerness to work together is apparent.
user1: The other star actors, Goode and Goodman-Hill, also shouldn't be forgotten; the entire A-list set of actors really comes together with great cohesion, as proven by the positive response.
user2: While director Morten Tyldum did take some liberties in the source material, he brings together an all star cast and compelling drama to weave a thrilling tale.
user1: Indeed, it is dangerous to attempt to bring a biopic into the limelight and general box office; but this film performed well, and Tyldum's gamble paid off for him handsomely.

conversation:
user2: Hey, I loved this movie!
user1: I thought it was rather boring.
user2: Oh, not me, anything with Benedict Cumberbatch is not boring.
user1: I'm not into history, which probably explains why I didn't appreciate this film.
user1: Have you read the book?
user2: The information in the document says that 91% of critics liked it, which is usually a good sign, I can't see where the percentage of regular people is listed.
user2: No, haven't read the book.
user1: That's a good point.  I might have to give it another shot.  Usually I disagree with critics though.  
user2: I don't normally read too many biographies, I guess I feel about them like you do about history.
user2: I thought the subject matter was very important, though, how he was treated by the general publiceven though he was basically winning the war for them.
user1: Definitely.  If I had to choose between a history book and a history movie I'd definitely choose the movie.
user2: It says in the information, though, that a lot of that conflict was injected into the movie and that it didn't really exist
user1: I feel like movies exaggerate everything.
user1: It's sad that he was bullied in school and even sadder that his love interest died before he could ever tell him that he was in love with him.
user2: Well, to be honest this all happened at a time when people did think like that about being gay, though. I mean, I was born in the 1950's and we never even talked about the possibility that anyone was. 
user2: Yeah, that is sad. The whole movie was sad,he was basically a genius who was taken for granted by the dull normals.
user1: That's a good point.  I was in my late teens before I even knew that gay was a thing.  
user2: It says in the document that they messed with the chronology of events in the movie, now I might HAVE to read the book!
user1: I was surprised that he actually came out during that time... however, not surprised that he was told to keep it a secret.
user1: The more we talk about it I kind of want to watch it again and possibly read the book to see what is different.
user2: Hmmm, that seems to be a Hollywood thing, altering a story to make money rather than sticking to the real story. I hate that.
user2: Yeah, I checked it out at the library and watched it, 
user2: I also really like Keira Knightley, but not as much as Cumberbatch.
user1: I couldn't agree more!  I think they seem to leave out important parts and then they add things that really don't make a difference just to glam it up
user1: Honestly I'd never heard of any of the actors in this movie before watching it.  They all did a great job thought!
user2: Really, you never heard of Benedict Cumberbatch?
user2: He is awesome!
user2: I'm looking at the information and it says it all happens between WWI and WWII.
user1: No I hadn't.  I'm going to have to look it up and see what else he is in.
user2: I am particularly attracted to stories from that time.
user2: I like to read about how Britain was involved in both wars before the US, I think as Americans we don't consider how scary it must've been for them and what they sacrificed before we went in.
user1: I mostly like movies set in the present.  I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I find myself watching "stupid funny" type movies more than anything.  
user2: I like those, too, because you don't have to pay a lot of attention to them, this movie you really had to watch because of all the information, if you didn't follow it you'd get lost.
user1: I wish I would have paid more attention to history in school.  There's so much I don't know because I didn't put forth any effort in learning about it.  I just had an automatic wall up when it came to history.  I always deemed it as boring without giving it a chance really.
user1: That is probably why I became bored with it.  I have to be just in the right mood to really give my full attention to a movie.  Otherwise my mind is just going a  million miles a  minute and I can't concentrate.  I will give this movie another shot though... You have me convinced that it's better than I thought!
user2: Wow, the last part blows my mind.
user2: The part about where they destroy their work? Did they destroy the machine? I can't remember.
user1: I was just thinking about how crazy that he came out to the same guy he ended up revealing as a spy.  
user2: The guy was probably trained to be charming or something, who knows.
user2: I guess spies are trained to get your trust.
user1: I knew there was something up with him!  I even told my husband that he was up to no good.
user2: Lol.
user2: So you were watching more closely than you thought!
user1: I guess so!
user2: I thought we were supposed to have 3 conversations, is this still the first one? I don't really understand how this works.
user1: I'm confused too! Lol.
user2: I think we might be done.
user2: It said 20 minutes and it's been longer than that, right? 
user1: Definitely.
user2: Okay, nice talking to you. Bye.
user1: It was nice chatting with you!  I'm gonna see about watching this again.  Have a good night!

conversation:
user2: Hi there! 
user1: Hi 
user1: Are you interested in Historical movies which deal with real life events
user2: Yes, as long as they're done well.
user2: Have you seen any movies like that lately?
user1: Yes the Imitation Game, its really good and has a high rating 7.7/10
user2: Oh cool. What real life events is it based on? 
user1: its based off Alan Turing who decryped german codes which help save thousands of lives in WWII
user1: Its known as one of the greatest movies of 2014
user2: Oh wow. That was such an interesting time in history. All the research they were doing on codes, antibiotics etc. His story was so tragic, though.
user1: Yes it was.. the romantic feelings he had for his friend and the unexpected ending of Alan was so sad
user2: It's good to know the movie was well done, though. I might check it out. 
user1: Yeah! I mean it got 73/100 from Metacritic and a cinemaScore of A+!! isnt that impressive
user1: Do you watch movies with high ratings?
user2: I try to, but I more read Rotten Tomatoes. Is Metacritic an aggregator type service, too.
user1: Yes it is. And not to mention Rotten Tomatoes gave this move a 91%. Looks like the aggregator you read gave this movie a high rating as well
user2: Cool. I think I remember this won some Oscars? 
user1: Yes I believe so too. The performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing was phenomenal  
user2: Oh wow. I feel like from 2014-15 Cumberbatch was in everything. But he's such a versatile performer that it's always nice to see him.
user1: Yes, even The Hollywood Reporter stated Cumberbatch was the highlight of the film with his charisma and his potraying of physical oddness was true talent
user2: That's high praise from them, they can be vicious when they want to be. 
user2: Do you like period movies or more modern ones? 
user1: They sure can. But Empire stated is as a "superb thriller" and a classic which I can only agree with
user1: Period is good but I enjoy more modern ones
user2: Cool. I like  a variety of films, too.
user2: The great thing about the ones set in the 20th century and later is that they're more relatable
user2: At least for me.
user1: Do ratings matter to you with movies?
user1: For sure 
user1: have you watched any other movies with the actors - Keira Knightley, matthew goode or Tom Goodman-hill?
user2: I like Keira Knightley a lot
user2: Ratings matter to me, but I will also see something with poor ratings if I think it has potential
user2: How about you? 
user1: Ratings matter to me alot 
user1: I also like Keira Knightley
user1: How about Genre? Do you like Drama?

conversation:
user2: Hi. So what movie is up for dissuasion?
user1: Hi User 2. We will be discussing The Imitation Game. I must admit that I've never seen this movie. Honestly, I don't remember ever hearing of it. What about yourself?
user2: I don’t remember seeing it either. I can’t even remember who stars in it.
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Tom Goodman-Hill are listed as the cast members. It came out in 2014 and is actually based on the biography of Alan Turing, but I've never heard of him.
user2: Isn’t it a spy thriller if I remember correctly?
user2: Definitely a good cast 
user1: Technically its listed as a Drama more so than a thriller, but yes, Alan Turning was a real-life British cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes during WWII
user2: The k that makes sense. Biographies made into movies can be quite interesting.
user1: I agree. They are indeed some of my favorite because the events actually occurred. 
user2: I need to go find this and watch it.
user2: I still can’t believe I forgot about it. 
user1: I wonder if it is available on Netflix or Hulu. The reviews from the critics were mostly glowing. There were a few that thought it took much too much liberty in 
user1: expanding the material.
user2: I think that is always the case in these types of movies. How else are they supposed to get an audience to sit through it without falling asleep.
user1: I suppose you are right about that. 
user1: Reality isn't as exciting as make believe 
user1: (to some)
user2: Yep plus we don’t always know the exact truth either.
user1: That I can agree with. No matter what is written down in a book or told by an individual. Truth can be left out and altered by the person who lived it.
user2: Very much true. 
user1: I was about to ask you when this conversation ends, but I see that I was provided with some new information in regards to the movie.
user1: My document now lists some of the key scenes within the movie. One of which is about Turing's machine that he named Christopher.
user2: I’m glad you were able to have the information. It is most definitely go on my watch list.
user2: Ok that sounds cool. It still amazes me how much came from ww2
user1: Me too. Maybe instead of so many commercials and previews we should get an overview of movies like this. It might inspire me to watch more. 
user1: WWII is definitely one of my favorite eras. There was just so much going on around the world. 
user2: I agree. I know people don’t like spoilers but I don’t mind reading overview and get the general idea of the movie. 
user1: It looks like we were given even more scenes! I thought that this was only going to last 5 minutes per conversation. I guess I should have reread the instructions. lol
user2: Lol yea I think it said we had to reply like 15 times or something. I think it’s cool how they have this set up. Kiddos to the research team.
user2: Any other interesting key scenes?
user1: Well, while we are waiting here is some extra information for you. Apparently Turing talks Keira Knightly's character into marriage, but he is actually a homosexual. 
user2: Not surprised by that. Very common in that era.
user1: He reveals this to one of his "friends" at his reception of all places and warns him to keep it a secret
user1: Later, he will find out that his "friend" is actually a soviet spy! And of course if Turing outs him he threatens to out his sexuality.
user2: Makes sense. It’s looks like we can finish now. It was really fun doing this with you. Hope you have a great day.
user1: Thanks you too!

user1: two policemen, Nock and Staehi, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apprarent break-in=at his home.
user2: it doesn't make any sense
user2: but i will try
user1: ok great
user1: The Imitation Game is a 2014 American historical drama film directed by Morten Tyldum andwritten by Graham Moore, loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by AndrewHodges (which was previously adapted as the stage play and BBC drama Breaking the Code). Itstars Benedict Cumberbatch as real-life British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted German

conversation:
user2: Hello, I am just reading the document and then, let's chat!
user1: Yes
user1: Ok
user2: The "Imitation Game" seems to be a biographical thriller. Why do you think the movie got such a good rating on rotten tomatoes?
user1: It could be for many reasons being a biography 
user2: Yes, of all the actors in the movie, who do you like the best?
user1: Keira knightly
user2: Me too, what is this biography loosely based on, again?
user1: It is a variety of chronological events
user1: I personally think the title is a bit cheesy
user2: Yes, the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges. 
user2: I agree.
user2: It is also quoted as being "one of the most important stories of the last century..."  hmmmmm, I don't know about that! 
user1: I don't know about the many liberties
user2: Yes, adjusting source material to add conflict where none existed.
user1: I'm still lost with this set up with this hit
user2: I think we were supposed to be able to press Finish conversation by now?
user1: I can't see any more of the conversation
user2: I would take screen shots just in case and then you can always try to submit and message them...

user1: unfortunately you got the information about the movie. not me. You are supposed to read about the movie and tell me what it is about. 
user2: this movie story is second world war
user1: okay. thats a start. you said it was a historical drama. is it about a person or an event? 
user2: this is just only event not person.
user1: okay thanks. what was the event? what is a short summary of the plot? 
user2: i don't know about the plot please ask another question about the plot
user1: well you are suppose to have information about the movie provided to you and you were supposed to read it to tell me about the movie. 
user1: read your instructions for the chat
user2: this movie directed by morten tyldum 
user1: i see. it still doesnt tell me anything about the film. All I know is that you have said its a historical drama set in WW2. Is that all you know about the movie? 
user1: thanks for trying. I guess I'll find about more about this film and decide if I want to watch it. Thanks. 
user2:  the English mathematical genius Alan Turing tries to crack the German Enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.
user2: k bye
user1: thanks. thats better. now I know something about the film. it sounds interesting. 
user2: please left the conversation
user1: yep I will. 

conversation:
user2: Hows it going
user2: Have you seen the imitation game
user1: Hey. Yes, I have.
user2: Did you like it
user1: I thought it was just alright.
user2: Yeah it was a little slow at times
user1: Agreed. But most of these type of movies are.
user2: Yeah, it did have some good people in it though
user1: That never really mattered to me. I would have seen it either way since the story interests me.
user2: Anything based off of true story is good by me
user1: Usually, yes. I did hear that they put their own spin on a few things. That's a shame.
user2: I guess they have to sometimes

conversation:
user1: This movie seems to have good reviews
user2: Agreed, I like the rating from Glamour. I'm a huge fan of their content.
user1: Do you like Benedict Cumberbatch as an actor? 
user2: Honestly, I don't recognize the name. I am a fan of Keira Knightley. How about you?
user1: Yeah, he is a good actor, he's done some British TV as well. I like Keira Knightley as well. Have you seen any other movies by this director? 
user2: No, actually I haven't. Have you seen this movie?
user1: Yes I have, it was very nice, although I didn't think it was very true to the life of Alan Turing. How about you? 
user2: I'm more of a horror fan, but it does sound very interesting. So you're familiar with Turing?
user1: Somewhat, yes. You said that you like horror; how about biopics? 
user2: Not so much, but I do find it interesting that Turing decrypted German intelligence code. 
user2: It says Turing was bullied in school. That's awful.
user1: Well some of the views state that the movie took some artistic license, so I am not sure whether that is true. How do you feel about the movie having so much artistic license? 
user2: I think they should stick to the facts more and not sensationalize so much. I see this has reference to the war in it. Did the movie have a lot of war scenes in it?
user1: Not really, it was mostly centered around the research facility where Turing worked with his team. I think there were no war scenes in it at all. Do the war scenes bother you? 
user2: I don't like to see war scenes when it has to do with Nazis. The Enigma machine sounds interesting?
user1: Yeah, the Enigma machine was definitely the highlight of the movie. How do you feel about the fact that Turing was gay? Do you think they should have omitted that fact in the movie? 
user2: No, if that's really who he was, I guess it would be important to his character. It sounds like he might have should have kept it secret back then though.
user1: Yes I guess he wasn't secretive enough in his real life. But don't you think that the exploration of his sexuality distracts from the message of the movie? Or do you think it actually aids the movie's aim? 
user2: No, in this day and age, I guess it gives his character more dimension. It explains why he names the machine after Christopher I guess. He must have looked pretty suspicious for the police to investigate him because someone broke into his home.
user1: Maybe they didn't believe him when he told them about his work for the government and it seemed suspicious to them. 
user1: Why do you think they made this movie? 
user2: Maybe so, have you seen the BBC drama Breaking the Code?
user1: No, I haven't. Is it similar to this movie? 
user2: That's what I was wondering. I feel sorry for Clarke. He shouldn't have lied to her.
user2: I think they made the movie because Turing was definitely multi-faceted. He seems to have had quite an interesting life.
user1: I agree, but at least she had the job opportunity to work with him
user1: Definitely. How do you feel about Turing revealing that Cairncross is a Soviet spy? 
user2: Well, when you think about it, Cairncross in a way, like Turing, was pretending to be something he really wasn't. So that's kind of an interesting irony.
user1: Yeah, I didn't see that connection before. 
user1: How do you feel about the fact that the British did not act on every decoded message? Do you think it was ethically correct to pick and choose which information was used for their benefit? 
user2: I've enjoyed the chat. I think I will have to go find this movie and check it out now.
user1: Definitely, it's a nice movie. It was nice chatting with you

conversation:
user1: I was surprised to find out that Benedict Cumberbatch was in this movie
user1: Do you feel this movie was accurate?
user2: I really like him. I saw the movie and liked it. It has a really high score on rotten tomatoes
user1: It is definitely an instant classic.
user2: I don't actually know too much about Alan Turing. I guess the movie wasn't accurate?
user1: It seems to take liberties with its source material.
user2: I know that he was gay and he ate a cyanide pill. That was in the movie. I know he invented the machine that would become the computer
user1: But it is a film, and not a documentary so I guess that's not unusual.
user1: It seems that Turing's actual story is very compelling - a shame they had to embellish.
user2: True. It has to be interesting to keep the audience's attention.
user1: However it was beautifully written
user2: I thought the Imitation Game as a concept is what led to Do Android's dream about electric sheep which would become Bladerunner?
user2: I liked it a lot. I really thought Benedict Cumberbatch was amazing in the role. He is such a chameleon
user1: I do not know about that, but it does talk about them trying to decrypt the Enigma machine.
user2: It was so sad about about his loving Christopher so much who died
user1: It seems Turing was bullied at boarding school - I guess working with codes was less stressful than dealing with bullies.
user1: But Christopher did spark his interest in cryptology
user2: He was such an amazing mind to live in an age where being gay was illegal. So sad
user1: Interesting that he named the machine Christopher
user2: Yeah he never forgot him
user1: And that it was to be destroyed by Denniston.
user2: I liked Keira Knightley in the movie too
user1: But then he married - which seems odd.
user1: Yes she is good.
user2: Oh yeah that was right about the Enigma machine being destroyed. Very emotional scene
user2: I liked how they figured out how to break the code with the weather announcement
user1: Feel really bad for Clarke. You would think she would have known he was gay, but it seems she was blind to it.
user1: And then Caimcross being a spy !!
user1: and then Turing confronts him and all heck breaks loose!
user2: Yeah. Also so emotional that they couldn't act on every message that they had to stand by while they knew people would die
user1: Or else they would realize they could decode them
user1: hard thing to have to do
user2: Then they had to keep everything that they had done secret
user1: then to tell them they had to split up and could never talk about it or see each other again
user2: And Christopher got Turing interested in code breaking. Christopher was such a huge influence

conversation:
user2: I really liked The Imitation Game. What about you?
user1: Yes, I really enjoyed it as well.
user2: Do you typically like historical dramas?
user1: I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and thought that he did an excellent job.
user2: Historicals aren't always my favorite, but I generally agree with Rotten Tomatoes, so I thought their score made it a pretty safe bet. 
user1: I've liked a few historical dramas that I've seen. I agree. I always check Rotten Tomatoes before watching a movie. If it doesn't have a good score, then I typically decide not to watch it. 
user2: Keira Knightley usually doesn't do movies that bomb either.  I think they worked well together. 
user1: She's one of my favorite actresses. Did you read Andrew Hodges biography Alan Turing: The Enigma before watching the movie?  
user2: I did not.  I was familiar with the story, but not enough to know exactly how accurate the movie was. I felt like it was an entertaining movie, even though apparently they took some liberties in the accuracy of the story they told. 
user2: We seem to be stuck on this first document...
user1: Haha, I know...
user2: *sigh*   So... would you agree with Empire as describing it as a thriller? While it had its tense moments, I don't know that I'd categorize it like that.
user1: Yeah, I don't think I wold categorize it as a thriller, but I agree with Glamour on it being described as an instant classic. 
user1: I didn't like the scene where Christopher dies before Turing can confess his love to him. So sad!
user2: Makes you wonder how Turking's story could have played out, had that not happened. 
user2: Errr... Turing. (habit)I wonder what characters were just entirely made up! I wasn't aware that any were.
user2: They all seemed to fit in perfectly, and be very believable. 
user1: Yeah, its hard to know. Morten Tyldum did a great job directing the film
user2: He certainly did.   And I think Matthew Goode was perfect as Hugh Alexander. Now that I've seen those people in those roles, I can't imagine anyone else playing them. 
user2: I loved that Turing named his machine "Christopher". Such a sweet tribute.
user1: Yes. I loved that. Were you surprised when Turing proposed marriage to Clarke?
user2: Very! And also surprised at how quickly he confirmed his homosexuality to someone. I mean... during their reception? He was a bold man. 
user1: Yes, I'm sure that was not easy to do! Good thing Caimcross was trustworthy.
user2: Yeah, back then that could have resulted in a vastly different outcome for Turing.  I'm sure that Joan Clarke would have appreciated the heads up too though. 
user2: Smart thinking on his part that he didn't decode EVERY message, to keep the Germans in the dark about their codes being broken. 
user1: Yes! Thankfully he realized that. The circumstances could have been devastating. He was a smart man. Good thing he didn't end up getting fired!
user2: I'm sure Turing was devastated when he realized Caimcross was a Soviet spy. I didn't see that coming!
user1: Me neither! That was so disappointing. And it was so sad that it resulted in him telling Joan that he didn't care for her in order to protect her. 
user2: Turing accomplished so many things. It's a shame his life was wrought with so many tragedies.
user1: Yes, having to destroy his work and not see any of his team mates again must have been so difficult. 
user2: We are 43 minutes into this. :)
user1: :) I'm pretty much out of things to say!
user2: Right? We could have watched the movie, just about. 
user1: Haha, true!
user2: Ooh our Finish button is available finally. :)  Thanks. Good luck!

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: this sound very spirtual
user2: yeah I feel I would be moved.
user1: It would have me thinking for a whole
user2: a whole what?
user1: I meant a while
user1: sorry
user2: no it ok
user1: the actual story is apparently better
user1: yeah
user2: yeah not sure what else to say
user1: the policeman sound interesting
user2: tes they do
user1: oh man the war backdrop is intense
user2: yeah war sucks
user1: for sure
user2: war never changes
user1: hahaha nice
user2: it has decent reviews
user1: yeah it must be an ok fuilm
user2: i wonder what the enigma machine exactly did
user1: yeah i dont quite understand
user1: it would be cool to look it up later
user2: yeah i think i will too
user1: turing gay?
user2: yeah it appears so
user1: I like gay people in films
user2: me too
user1: it adds some flavor
user2: agreed

conversation:
user1: Ready!
user2: Hi!  What's the name of the movie?
user1: The Imitation Game
user2: Okay.  I'm interested in seeing that.  What can you tell me about the plot?
user1: It an American historical drama, based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma
user1: Do you know the book?
user2: I don't, though I have heard of Alan Turing.  Who stars in the movie?
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Tom Goodman
user2: Did the movie get good reviews?
user1: 7.7/10 , 73/100 , A+
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: No I have not.  I don't think I would be interested. 
user2: Why?
user1: Not my type of movie; However the reviews are good and you should probably see it if you like those types of movies.
user2: I'm not certain.  Is there romance, too?
user1: There doesn't appear to be.  It's listed as a Drama, biopic
user2: Gotcha
user1: The movie is quite different from the book, if that matters. 
user2: I DO like Cumberbatch, though I prefer some comedy/romance...something like that.
user2: Love Sherlock, but this isn't really up my alley, either
user2: Not a huge fan of biopics.
user1: Ha, I gotcha.  
user2: Any other details about the movie on the document?
user1: Yes, it's based on a BBC drama called Breaking the Code.  Have you ever heard of it?
user2: I have not
user1: It has a lot of spy elements to it. 
user2: Yeah, I think I'll pass on the movie.  
user1: If it were more focused on the 'real' story it would probably be more enticing. 
user2: Agreed
user2: Nothing is more frustrating than an inaccurate historical film
user1: This is interesting.  The movie is set in 1939.  I bet some of the settings would be cool to look at from that time period. 

conversation:
user1: Who is supposed to start the chat?
user2: The aspect of the imitation game I enjoyed the most is that it's a period piece. Those films transport me to a different world better.
user2: And I also like British movies but this one was an American movie that thought it was British. haha.
user2: Dude, you're just supposed to read the document, pretend you watched the movie, and chat about it.

conversation:
user1: The movie is The Imitation Game. I have not seen it, have you?
user2: No I have not even heard of it
user1: It was a book of the same name, it is a drama and biography. Do you like movies in those genres?
user2: depends, as long as its not too touchy feely. Whats it about
user1: It is about Alan Turing, a guy who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. I think it is supposed to be interesting and thrilling/
user1: The actors are Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. Have you heard of them?
user2: I like those type of dramas, they are usually interesting to me as I like hi
user2: Ive heard of keira knightly but would have to see there faces as I'm not usually good at knowing the actors
user1: It has very high scores on different move critic websites. Do you usually follow movie critics recommendations? 
user2: Yes and no, I look at what critics say and also what regular folks who have seen the movie. Critics don't always have the same taste as I do
user2: I try to gage from the previews as well plus what the story is about
user1: I agree with you. Some critics were upset that the movie made a lot of changes from the real life story. I think that is ok to do to make a movie flow better, how about you?
user2: Changes are fine, if I want the details I will read the biography lol. Movies cant tell everything as they are short on time and have to entertain you so a little creative changes should be done
user2: They don't make too many historical movies as they usually do not make money. these days its comic book heroes that are raking in the big buck
user2: Do you like movies like this?
user1: I really enjoy biography movies. Especially ones like this that involve bigger world events.
user1: Apparently part of this movie involves Turing (the main guy) being in love with his male friend. I wonder if that would be too touchy-feely for you to enjoy it, like you said earlier?
user2: As long as it not the whole movie and does put in enough about what they actually did I'm okay with it
user1: This movie is set in Bletchley Park, England. I don't know about you, but I have never been to England. 
user2: I was in London when I was little but only for a day. remember that everything was really expensive as we had to stay a day for a layover. don't know if id want to visit seems too crowded fro me. I prefer someplace warm
user1: Haha that's fair
user2: how about you ever visit Europe
user1: I have been to France.
user2: Paris>
user1: Yes.
user1:  The codebreaking machine in the film is nicknamed Christopher. I think that's silly, do you?
user2: He probably liked winny the pooh - Christopher robin there was no internet back then so using your head was necessary
user1: That's a good conclusion.
user1: Based on what I've told you about the movie, are you interested in seeing it?
user2: Id say when it comes out on Netflix or amazon and I have nothing better to do I would. However it has to catch my attention at the beginning for me to watch a movie all the way through. I've watched some stinkers just because I wanted to see the end as the start caught my attention
user1: I think it is on netflix already, as the movie came out in 2014. I agree I would watch it for free rather than paying to rent it individually.
user1: The more I read of the plot, the more interesting it becomes. But I don't want to spoil it for you
user2: I only go to see kids movies these days as I have been burned too many times seeing a great preview and then spend the money and the movie a big pile of poo
user1: I have not seen a movie in the movie theater in a long time. 
user2: They are a lot better now. the seats are fake leather and super wide and you can lean it back like a lazyboy. 
user2: nice talking to you

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi have you see. The Imitation game?
user2: yp
user2: yup
user2: i forget the name
user2: talk something about the movie
user1: I have not seen it but it seems like Benedict Cumberbatch won an award for his role
user1: Did you think he played his role well in the movie?
user2: yes he always playing well
user2: also in the movie too

conversation:
user2: I really loved the movie 'The Imitation Game'. I thought the movie did a good job showing the life of Alan Turing.
user1: I really like how it's based on a true story and tells us the history of one great man.
user2: Yeah, I agree. I thought Benedict Cumberbatch did a really good acting job.
user1: Do you usually like movies that are based on true stories?
user2: Yes. That's why I especially likes this film.
user1: Do you feel the score for this film by critics is too low for the quality of the film?
user2: Yes, I think the Metacritic score was way too low. I don't understand why it only received a 73/100.
user1: I think Keira Knightley was outstanding in her role as Joan Clarke, she really brought the character to life.
user2: I agree. I thought Cumberbatch and Keira had excellent chemistry together.
user1: Does it bother you that the movie takes a few liberties with the source material or is that fine to make the movie more interesting?
user2: I think it's OK to take some liberties to move the story forward. However, I like the movie to try and stay as close to factual information as possible.
user1: I really like the world war 2 setting and the mystery that comes with the Nazis.
user2: I definitely think it was the best film of 2014.
user1: Do you think it was okay for him to hide his homosexuality and should it have been part of the movie?
user2: He had to hide his sexuality. He didn't have a choice. Yes, I think it was extremely important to be included in the movie because that was a central theme to his own life. 
user1: Do you think he proposed marriage to make sure the project would get completed under him without anyone finding out?
user2: Yes, I think that was the reason.
user1: Why do you think it got such a low score from certain critics and others rated it highly?
user2: I think some might have had a problem with the liberties taken.
user1: Do you think it was fair for Menzies to require them to destroy their work after the war?
user2: No, I don't think it was fair because they should have kept it for future generations to be able to look at and study.
user1: Do you think the other cryptographers could have figured out how to break the code without Turings machine?
user2: No, I don't think they could have.
user1: Do you think it was fair to feed the Soviets information when it was in the British advantage?
user2: No, because innocent British people died because of that.

conversation:
user1: Wow. The writers really took some liberties with the source material.
user2: hello
user2: Did you watch the movie The imitation game?
user1: yeah that is what I was talking about
user1: did you see it?
user2: yeah its a great movie
user2: you can learn a lot about history
user2: about Alan Turing
user2: and the Enigma
user1: I enjoyed it as well. They certainly took some artistic liberties with the plot. They invented whole fictional characters, and made up conflicts that didn't exist.
user2: Benedict acted really good
user1: You might say it was beautifully written, but like so many Hollywood biopics, it is disappointing because Turing's story is so compelling on its own.
user2: I like mathematics thats why its so interesting to me
user2: He had such a hard childhood
user2: when he was so unhappy 
user2: and bullied
user1: yes he did a good job portraying Turing.
user1: It did pretty well on Rotten tomatoes.
user2: Yeah CinemaScore too, A+!
user1: Yes it's true he had a hard time in boarding school.
user2: its really one important storie to know
user1: It was sad about his marriage
user2: yes
user1: I guess he was bullied in school maybe that is why things didn't work out for him with women.
user1: Especially sad after the man he loved died.
user1: what a strange life.
user2: but he came out and said he was homosexual
user1: no wonder he became a code breaker
user2: yeah
user1: I wonder how much of that is artistic license
user1: he was clearly conflicted about his sexuality
user2: Soviets tried to find out what he was doing 
user1: I guess things were different in 1951
user2: alot different
user1: yeah that was pretty intense. Maybe the break in that was being investigated really was the Soviets
user2: It was so private
user2: they couldnt talk to noone about what they are doing
user2: that could have been frustrating
user2: in the end they even had to destroy it all
user2: was nice to talk to you m8, great movie
user1: very nice to talk to you as well.

conversation:
user2: Hello, have you seen The Imitation Game? It's one of the most important stories of the last century!
user1: I have not.
user1: What genre is the film?
user2: It is historical, based on the life of Alan Turing.
user1: What year did it come out?
user2: It came out in 2014.
user1: Can you tell me a few of the actors in it?
user2: It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the real life British cryptanalyst Alan Turing. It also stars Keira Knightly, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Charles Dance, and Mark Strong.
user1: How long is it?
user2: I don't know how long it is, but Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 91% approval rating, and CinemaScore gave it an A+.
user1: What can you tell me about the plot/Alan Turing?
user2: Alan Turing decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during the Second World War. It tellls the story of his life starting with when he was a boy at a boarding school in 1927, and how he developed an interest in cryptography at that time. Then it tells bout how he helped the British after they declared war on Germany in 1939. It starts in out in 1951 though, with an older Turing telling his life's story after his home is broken in to.
user1: What is the MPAA rating?
user2: I don't know.
user1: Probably PG-13, I bet.
user2: Perhaps.
user1: Have you ever seen it?
user2: No. But, Empire described it as a "superb thriller".
user1: What else can you tell me?
user2: It was directed by Morten Tydlum.
user1: Do you know what other movies he has directed?
user2: no, but the book this was loosely based on, The Enigma by Andrew Hodges was previously adapted for a stage play and a BBC drama called Breaking the Code.
user1: I wonder what the budget for the film was?
user2: No telling.
user1: Those were some pretty great review scores that you provided earlier. Did it win any major awards?
user2: I don't know.
user1: Do you have anymore information?
user2: The plot also reveals that Turing is gay.
user1: Are there any other personal details about him that get revealed?
user2: He had romantic feelings for his childhood friend, Christopher Morcom. And Turing marries a woman who he later reveals his homosexuality to.
user1: I see. Thanks so much for educating me! That should be enough information.
user2: Ok. Have a good day.
user1: Likewise.

conversation:
user2: hii
user1: This movie has a pretty good cast
user1: Hi
user2: yes 
user2: i like that movie
user2: which charcter like that movie
user1: what do you mean?
user1: I liked the movie too, Benedict Cumberbatch is very tallented
user2: yes 
user1: Looks like it received very good ratings on the various movie sites as well.
user2: yeah
user1: I did not know much about Alan Turing before this film. It looks like his life was a bit rough
user1: Do you generally take ratings into accound when you are deciding on what film to watch?
user1: Hello?
user1: Hello?

conversation:
user1: Hello.  What can you tell me about the movie?
user2: it was quite a good dramatization of Alan Turing's life
user1: What was the movie called?
user2: One of the best historical dramas I have seen
user2: The Imitation Game
user1: Would you recommend that children watch the movie?
user2: No
user2: I do not think they would enjoy it
user2: But there is nothing explicit about it
user1: Just boring to kids?
user1: What was your favorite part?
user2: Yeah they probably would not get it
user2: When they were able to get Alan's machine working
user2: I felt so happy for them
user1: Who are the actors in the movie?
user2: alright ;et me see
user2: I know the guy from Sherlock Holmes is in it
user2: Benedict Cumberbatch 
user1: Oh okay I like him
user2: Keira Knightley too
user1: She's great
user2: those are the only 2 I remember right now
user1: That's a good start.  
user1: Do they talk with an accent the whole movie?
user2: no I dont believe so 
user1: Is there much action?
user2: not really
user2: a bit at the end
user1: Is it more of just an interesting movie?
user1: I have never heard anything about it, that's why I ask.  
user2: It makes you think a lot about the war, about Turing's accomplishments
user2: it is an astonishing experience
user1: What war is it?
user2: WW2
user1: Excellent thank you!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello - I've been reading about The Imitation Game. You should see it!
user1: Yeah, what is it about?
user2: It's a thriller about a real-life British cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British Government during the Second World War.
user1: Really!  I like history and thrillers.   Who is acting in it?
user2: It stars Benedict Cumberbatch. The Hollywood Reporter said he was great at portraying a "genius at work".
user1: Sounds great.  When does it come out for viewing?
user2: It came out in 2014, and it got a 91% from Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: I guess that I am a little behind on my movies then.  I definetely check it out next time I'm in a video rental place.
user2: Great! Do you mind if it's not exactly 100% historically accurate?
user1: Not really.  They never are very accurate.  Is it very sensationalized?
user2: They just had to make a story people could follow. It starts with some police questioning Turing after a break in at his home. I've no idea if that really happened, but it made a good excuse for him to start talking about who he is...
user1: As long as it makes for a good story.  Are there any books that describe the true story?
user2: I think Turing's life is widely documented, at least the interesting bits. It's well known that he had romantic feelings for other men, for example.
user1: Oh.  That was not a great time, or place to be a gay man.  Does the movie go into how he dealt with that?
user2: Yes, it includes experiences from his boarding school life. In the film, he had a school friend he loved who unexpectedly died from tuberculosis. But the story then moves on to what happened in the war.
user1: Are there any subtitles?
user2: I'm not really sure. There is a lot about breaking German codes with a machine they build, but I don't remember if anyone speaks much German. Do you like films where they speak other languages?
user1: Makes it more realistic in my opinion.  When appropriate anyways.  What is the movie rating?  
user2: I don't think I know the age rating, if that's what you mean. Sorry about that. It got a Metacritic score of 73/100 and a CinemaScore of A+ though, if that helps!
user1: I was reffering to the age rating.  I have a young daughter and I don't want to have to explain the birds and bees until she is at least 45.  Are there any explicit scenes that she couldn't see?
user2: Sorry, I don't recall if there is anything explicit, physically. There is quite a bit of talk about sexuality, as Turing marries a woman but keeps his homosexuality a secret, which is a major part of his character.
user1: Yeah, she probably shouldn't watch.  But the cinamegraphics were good huh?
user2: There are a lot of nice things to see, yes, like Bletchley Park where they worked on the codes, and while there is machinery they have to film for the story, there are lots of interesting characters too.
user1: Awesome.  Well, I'm interested for sure.  Actually, it makes me really want popcorn.  Is it one of those movies that you can eat popcorn while watching, or will the sound of the chewing make it impossible to watch?
user2: Now that is a great question, and I can hardly ever watch a movie without popcorn! With all the characters crossing and double crossing, I guess it's important to follow the dialogue, but as long as you can hear over your crunching, you should be fine!
user1: I really don't know how much more to ask.  Decent soundtrack?
user2: Can't really say. I can't imagine a decent thriller without one, though, can you? It really is a good drama with a great cast.
user1: Well, thanks for the info.

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: Hello
user1: did you see this movie
user2: Have you ever seen The Imitation Game? I have not
user1: I have, its pretty good
user2: Do you think it looks good?
user1: based on a true story
user2: Cool, who is your favorite character in it?
user1: Benedict cumberbatch is awesome as always
user1: his character was a real person
user2: I didn't know it was based on a true story
user1: yeah, it was right before and during the second world war
user1: so its very historic
user2: What kind of film is it?
user1: its kind of a thriller
user2: Is Keira Knightly good in it?
user1: a historic thriller
user1: she is surprisingly 
user2: Did it get good ratings?
user1: Yeah, it had some reward nominations
user1: it was praised by a lot of people
user2: It got  a really good rating on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Yeah it did
user2: It had a really great score on CinemaScore too
user1: when both of those scores match that usually means its a great score
user1: or movie
user2: But, it looks like it got a bad rating on Metacritic
user1: Oh well, I think cinemascore is the most important
user1: because it involves fans
user2: Are there a lot of special effects in the film?
user1: Not really, its mostly a thriller or drama that takes place in one building
user2: That sounds pretty interesting. It's a low key movie
user1: yes, its a little slow but good
user2: Did you see it in theaters in 2014?

conversation:
user1: So how did you like the movie?
user2: Hey there. Just wondering if you saw the movie The Imitation Game. And what you think about it  I actually like the movie a lot because of it's classic thriller vibe
user1: I didn't really like the thriller part of it. That doesn't really fit the source material to me.
user2: The fact that Kiera Knightley was one of the main characters really blew my mind. It's beautifully written. But I can see why you don't like it 
user1: She and Benedict Cumberbatch are always pretty good, but Hollywood changes too many things to make them more fake and overdramatic and I don't like that.
user2: I think I'm actually just really into historical drama. That's true actually. It isn't as original as how I would've expected it to be.
user1: I think the story could have been much better if there hadn't been so much artistic license. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not into historical dramas.
user2: Totally get your point. I just like I think the attractiveness combined with charisma of the starts in the movie
user1: That makes sense. Kiera Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch are always fun to watch. They made it a watchable movie even though it did mess up Alan Turing's story so much.

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: Hi, are you familiar with the movie Imitation game?
user2: No. What's it about?
user1: Its a historical drama directed by Morten Tyldum. Its based on biography of Alan Turing
user2: Oh cool. Did the movie come out recently?
user1: It came out 2014. Got 91% in Rotten tomatoes which I think is awesome
user2: That's cool! Are there any famous actors in the film?
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing in the movie. He did a great job
user1: Really interesting movie about second world war
user2: You said the movie is a historical drama. Do you know if it's historically accurate?
user1: Pretty much since its based on a biography.
user2: Is there any antagonists in the film?
user1: The Nazis because it s World war 2 movie. I actually forgot who is the main antagonist is
user2: Would you say that the film has a love interest for the main character?
user2: Or more specifically if there is a love interest in the movie.
user1: Yes there is. Turing is actually gay in the movie
user1: but his love interest died early in the movie
user2: I see. Is he open about it? Or does he try to hide it because it was not very spoken off at the time.
user1: He did not get a chance to confess since his love interest died before he got a chance. He named his cryptography machine after him
user2: So when you say cryptography machine was he a messenger of some sorts? Or decoder?
user1: its a decoder, their trying to decode military code messages 
user2: I see. Is he with the Americans? British? Australians? French?
user2: What was his country of origin?
user1: Britain so he is british
user2: Would you say that this would be a good movie to watch in the theaters or at home?
user1: I watch it at home but it is up to you. I definitely recommend it if you like historical movie
user2: Would you describe the film being as something that is an original idea? Or very similar to other WW2 movies?
user1: It is original, never seen anything like it before. It is both thrilling since they are trying to hide what they are doing to the authorities and touching since it is about being gay also at that period of time
user1: Thank you! Hope you watch it.
user2: Great! Well thank you for the recommendation. I will probably watch it soon on amazon! Thank you!

conversation:
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user1: It is the Imitation Game. Have you seen it?
user2: I have not. Who is staring in the movie?
user1: The four main stars are Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Tom Goodman-Hill
user2: I like Keira Knightley and Tom Goodman-Hill. Is it an action movie?
user1: It is a historical drama and it is based on a real life cryptanalyst Alan Turing. It gets excellent ratings.
user2: I am not sure what a cryptanalyst does. Will people who don't know be able to follow the story? 
user1: The critical reviews say that it is written well and that Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job of portraying Turing so it sounds like anyone would still be able to follow the story.
user2: You are probably right. Benedict Cumberbatch is a popular actor. What time period does the movie take place? 
user1: It takes place during World War II because Turing decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during that war.
user2: I did not know that. I wonder since it is a WWII movie it is violent or if they will only show the decryption related scenes? 
user1: I'm not sure but it also shows some of Turing's childhood too. It shows how he got his love of cryptogrphy and then progresses to his time helping the British. 
user2: I like that it has some of his backstory in it. It would be helpful to understand why he decided to take that path. Is it a family movie or rated more for adults? 
user1: I really don't know for certain. However, parts of the movie show that Turing lost the person he loves to tuberculosis and then when he works with the British they are trying to decrypt coded messages from the Nazis, so it sounds like it is more for adults.
user2: I agree. It sounds like there is some romance element to it also. Does Keira play the love interest? 
user1: No, I don't know the actor who plays the love interest. But the love interest is actually the man who sparked Turing's interest in cryptography, however he dies from tuberculosis before Turing can actually tell him. All of this takes place before Turing starts working with the British.
user2: That sounds like it will be sad to watch. Is there music in the movie? 
user1: It isn't in the musical genre so I don't know if there is much music, but interestingly, even though Keira Knightley does not play Turing's initial love interest, she and Turing end up getting married because Turing keeps his homosexuality a secret. 
user2: That would add an interesting twist to the story. Does it say how they met? 
user1: It sounds like they are both cryptographers. After Turing initially has trouble decoding messages, he gets fired, but other cryptographers threaten to leave if he does. Her character, Joan Clarke, is one who was going to leave before Turing proposed. 
user2: It sounds like there is some suspense in the film too. Does it give any background into how Joan decideds to get into this line of work? 
user1: I'm not sure why she got into the line of work, but it certainly sounds like his road to decryption wasn't easy. He finally succeeded though by programming the machine to decode the words he already knows exists in some messages.
user2: Does it explain how he learned those words? Or how he keeps track of them? 
user1: It doesn't, but the movie has even more interesting twists. The only person to whom Turing confessed his homosexuality (Cairncross) turned out to be a Soviet spy, and threatens to disclose Turing's sexuality if Turing reveals Cairncross is a Soviet agent.
user2: How does he discover he is a secret agent? 
user1: I don't know how he discovers it, but he finally reveals the fact to an MI6 agent. The story gets even crazier here because the MI6 agent knew Cairncross was a secret agent and planted him in the group to leak messages to the Soviets that would actually benefit the British. 
user2: How long is the M16 agent involved? Do you think they picked him from the beginning to plant him? 
user1: It is really hard to say for sure. But at the end after the war is over, the MI6 agent makes the cryptographers destroy all of their work and they are no longer to see one another or tell anyone about the work they did. 

conversation:
user2: Hi! So what did you think about the Initiation Game?
user2: *Imitation 
user1: I really liked it! how about you?
user2: Same here! It was great drama, in my opinion. So who was your favorite character? Mine was Alan!
user1: Alan was great, but I favored Keira Knightley's character Joan. Do you think the chronological order of these fictitious characters being changed altered the dynamics of the story?
user2: I do agree Keira's character Joan was great! It is really hard for me to honestly say in terms of the characters changing the dynamics of the story. What about you?
user1: I don't know how the events historically unfolded but i'm guessing from the document provided they did not happen in such an dramatic way.
user1: Do you find Cumberbatch eccentric?
user1: Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing that is. 
user2: I found he had a natural array of eccentricities.... I Did feel he was the highlight of the film. How about you?
user1: I think some of his actions may have been exaggerated for dramatic affect. Do you normally watch drama films?
user2: I do, not often, but occasionally.  I enjoy drama and biopics like The Imitation Game - especially those that are beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed. 
user1: How did the relationship between Turing and Morcom make you feel?
user2: I thought it was very sweet and heartbreaking in the end when he died of tuberculosis before Turing could confess his love. How about you?
user1: I also think it is sad. Do you think it was coincidence that Turing's love for cryptography makes it his destiny to solve the enigma?
user2: I think so honestly. That Enigma Machine was fascinating! How about you?
user1: Even if it wasn't his knowledge could not have been better used. How many people were in the cryptography team?
user2: I believe 5. I know it consisted of Hugh, John, Peter, Keith and Charles...
user1: Who is the director?
user2: How did you feel about Turing naming the machine "Christopher"?
user2: The director was Morten Tyldum. I thought Morten did a fantastic job directing!
user1: I thought it was quirky to name it after his crush.
user1: Did you realize Turing was gay before the flashback to his school days?
user2: I actually didn't realize that he was until he confessed it to Cairncross. What about you?
user1:  No it was a total surprise.
user1: What year was this movie made
user2: Agreed! How did you feel about Turing discovering  Cairncross was actually a Soviet spy? I was shocked!
user2: It was released in 2014!
user1: Why can't they act on the decoded messages from the enigma?
user2: It was because the Germans would have realized Enigma had been broken.
user1: What was the metacritic score and do you think that it was a accurate representation of the movie.
user2: It was 73/100 and I feel it maybe should have been a little higher. I enjoyed the fact that there were twists, such as Menzies already knowing Cairncross was a Soviet spy and and planted him among them for British benefits. That was a surprise to me.
user2: I thought the Rotten Tomatoes score was more accurate. 
user2: How did you feel about the story overall? I thought Graham Moore did a brilliant job writing the story based on the biography written by Andrew Hodges.

conversation:
user1: Hi, do you have a good movie to tell me about?
user2: The movie is called The Imitation Game
user1: Are there any popular actors in it?
user2: Keira Knightley, Benedict Cumberbatch
user2: also, Matthew Goode
user1: oh ok. What is the genre?
user2: It is a drama
user1: What is it about?
user2: A cryptanalyst who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British Government during WW2
user1: Wow, sounds interesting. Is there much action?
user2: I would say yes.
user1: Who is the main character?
user2: The main character is Alan Turing. He is played by b
user2: Benedict Cumberbatch
user1: Why does he need to decrypt the codes?
user2: The British government needs to know the codes.
user1: So, he's basically a spy?
user2: Yes, pretty much.
user1: How does he gain access?
user2: He joined a cryptography team. The team was trying to decrypt a machine that the Nazis used to send coded messages
user1: I see. So, he has help to do this?
user2: Yes, there were five other men on the team.
user1: Do they have an idea what the codes are about?
user2: The Germans reset the code each day, so it was difficult to determine. 
user1: I imagine. So, they encountered many obstacles along the way?
user2: Many obstacles. The machine was ordered to be destroyed and the main character to be fired, but the others threatened to leave if he was fired.
user1: So, he wasn't fired then?
user2: No, he was not fired.
user1: Were they finally successful?
user2: yes, he had an epiphany, realizing he could program the machine to decode words that he already knew existed in certain messages. He recalibrated the machine to decode the messages
user1: Sounds great. Thanks!
user2: you're welcome!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi, have you seen the movie?
user1: No, I have not.  Have you?
user2: I have. it was pretty good. I didn't realize at the time it was based on a true story
user1: What's the story about?
user2: Alan Turing, he invented a machine to break codes during, i think WW2
user1: Oh really?  I only recognize Kiera Knightley's name on the cast list.  Is the rest of the cast good?
user2: Benedict Cumberbatch was very good in it. I don't recognize any of the others
user1: I've heard of him, but I don't think I've ever seen a movie he's in.  It seems like this is a primarily UK movie.
user2: Yeah I think it was produced in Europe but it did very well here, won some awards even.
user1: The critical response looks like it's a movie everyone should see.  I'm just not really a fan of biopics.
user2: So he was gay, too. which was taboo at the time. I didn't feel that added much to the story though.
user2: Like most movies "based" on true stories. They embellish enough to make it exciting and enjoyable.
user1: I've never even heard of the person the movie is about.  It's interesting that they talked about him being gay.  I hope it wasn't just to sell movie tickets.
user1: Most biopics are definitely just "based on a true story" but painted as the real thing.
user2: I don't recall it being talked about at all in marketing, it was just revealed along the way in the movie
user1: Oh that's interesting!  I think gay people should be represented in movies more.  This is great!
user2: I suppose the more I think about it, I liked this biopic because the topic was about war history, which interests me.  Most other biopics would be fairly boring if they weren't in a genre that interested me.
user2: Homosexuality is definitely portrayed much more positively on TV today than it ever had in the past. And that is great.
user1: Ahh, I see.  I'm not really into war stories either.  I'm more of a horror or comedy person myself.  
user1: And they are being given more awards at the awards shows, too.  I think minorities are getting more and more acknowledgement in the movie industry.
user2: Wow, this movie came out in 2014, it seems a lot longer ago that I saw it. Reading some of the key scenes and i completely forgot some of it.
user1: I forget the dates movies come out all the time!   In a way it seems so long ago, but in another way it seems like yesterday!
user2: What's really crazy is that Harry Potter is over 20 years old! Unreal.
user2: I feel so old, I read those books when they came out
user1: WHOA!  It seems like only yesterday I was reading those books and and waiting for the movies to come out.  I feel old, too!
user2: I'm feeling like I don't quite understand this task. Were we supposed to talk about this movie more?
user1: Yeah, we probably got off track a bit.  
user2: Quite alright, it appears we're done, nice chatting with you
user1: Nice chatting with you, too!

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you seen the movie, the Imitation Game?
user2: No. I have not. What can you tell me about it? 
user1: I love Benedict Cumberbatch, although I cant say his name. Its a WW2 movie about this guy who breaks the Enigma Code that the Germans used
user1: It has Kiera Knightly in it too
user2: Meh. I've never cared much for war movies.
user1: Its more about the guy than it is the movie. His name was Alan Turning
user1: The critics said it was really good
user2: I may check it out in that case. I love biographical type movies.
user1: Some people said that it took liberties with the guys real life. He was so interesting they said, that it didnt matter. It was still great
user1: They gave it an A+
user2: I'll have to look up this guy on Google.
user1: It was at Bletchley park
user2: Do you know who directed this movie? 
user1: Its an English movie it was Directed by Morten Tyldum
user1: It came out in 2014
user2: Oh wow. An english movie. That is different.  
user2: Is it available on Netflix? 
user1: I think he might have been gay. The guy he was in love with died when he was in boarding school
user2: Wow. That is sad. 

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hi
user1: What did you think of the movie/
user2: I liked it it is called The Imitation Game have you seen it?
user1: No I have not seen it. Have you?
user2: Yes it is a historical drama directed by Morten Tyldum loosely based on  the biography Alan Turning: The Enigma
user1: It seems very interesting. I wonder where I could find it? 
user2: It was made in 2014 so you would need to rent it most likely
user1: I wonder if it is available online, like on Netflix or hulu. I will have to see if I can find it later. 
user2: I do not have information on that currently.  I do believe I have watched it on Netflix before though.
user1: Oh wait, I have seen this movie. I enjoyed it. Did you agree with the ratings of the movie?
user2: Yeah, It got 91% on Rotten Tomatoes and an A+ on Cinema Score
user1: It was also described as a superb thriller and Glamour declared it as an instant classic. I can't believe it didn't ring a bell with me when I saw the title. 
user2: Yeah I had to take a minute to realize I have seen it before as well.
user1: Who was the actress that played Joan Clarke? I can not remember her name.
user2: Keira Knightley
user1: The movie was undeniably strong in the sense of a light burned out too soon and the fate of many who dare to go against society norm. 
user2: Yes it was and the decryption of the German codes used during the war is very interesting.
user2: Do you have other questions about the cast or plot?
user1: Some points in the direction of the movie were disappointing because Turnings actual story was so compelling in my opinion. 
user1: Ha I was just about to ask you the same 
user2: I'm not too familiar with the actual story what are some of the differences?
user1: Just a few 
user2: I liked Benedict Cumberbatch in the movie I think he fit the role well.
user1:  Me too 
user1: What was the name of Turnings machine?
user2: Christopher
user1: Ah yes that was it . 
user2: Interesting name lol
user2: Well thanks have a good day
user1: For a machine it is 
user1: Good Day 

conversation:
user1: I know this movie has been on netflix for a while and I've been meaning to watch it because I've heard it's really good but the subject matter seems more fantasized that what it really is.
user1: you ever seen it?
user2: I have never seen it
user2: It sounds interesting because I find WW2 very interesting, but I have not gotten around to seeing it
user2: I think decrypting intelligence codes could make for a good movie
user2: Are you interested in WW2?
user1: Yea whenenver I think about the movie it sound interesting but it probably wasn't as cool as the movie makes it out to be
user1: Yea I love almost everything about ww2
user1: I used to watch documentaries on it all the time
user2: Have you seen Dunkirk?
user2: I haven't yet but want to.  I like Christopher Nolan's stuff
user1: oh man I loved dunkirk
user1: saw it in imax and was blown away
user1: its more of a ww1 movie but it didn't feel too different since it focused less on war and action
user2: Gotcha.  Yah that's still high on my list to see
user1: it was a very tense movie and imitation game would probably be more like a suspenseful drama while dunkirk is suspenseful action
user2: I just put 2 and 2 together and realized Turing is the same guy that developed the Turing Test
user1: Do you pay much attention to critic reviews?  I feel like I do nowadays just because there's so much garbage I don't wanna waste my time.  This movie seems to have a good rating so it's prolly worth watching
user1: Yea pretty sure Turing and his research started modern computers right?
user2: I actually don't read much critic reviews, but I probably should.  I mainly use IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, just the scores
user2: Yah I think so
user2: Definitely seems like he would have been an interesting guy
user1: I watch those guys on youtube called redletter media a lot to see what they think but mainly because they're funny
user1: Yea he would have to have been really smart to figure out those codes
user1: would be worth watching the movie just to see how he does it
user2: I'll have to check it out
user2: They post videos reviewing movies?
user1: yea a lot of their videos are based on movies that are so bad it's good types of films but the other half of their stuff is reviewing mainstream movies.
user1: they have little gags and jokes obviously but they try to stick to critiquing the movie mostly
user1: One of the reviews on the document talks about how they added stuff to imitation game that wasn't real
user1: I had heard that before, hopefully it wasn't much because I'd rather more of a biopic than a mainstream thriller
user2: I'll have to definitely check it out
user2: Yah I noticed that review, hopefully they didn't twist the story too much
user1: I don't like reading the document too much as it might spoil some stuff
user1: Benedict Cumberbatch is almost too famous and might actually be distracting during the movie
user2: I agree.  You know who might have been a good choice?  Eddie Redmayne
user2: But I guess he played Stephen Hawking recently, so may be too similar of parts
user2: Interesting that Turing confirms he was gay but still got married.  Obviously still a "stigma" at that time.
user1: Yea he prolly woulda fit the bill nicely.  He was alright in fantastic beasts
user1: Yea seems he knew at an early age he was gay
user1: unfortunate that he liked that kid who died from tuberculosis.  rare disease to die from these days I believe
user2: Yah I think tuberculosis claimed a lot of people during that time
user2: Before they developed a cure I believe
user1: Crazy that his homosexuality could be used as a weapon against him and blackmail him back then
user1: Also strange that they destroyed their work you would think they could've used it for other things.
user2: Yah that is peculiar that they were ordered to destroy their work
user2: It reminds me of Nicola Tesla.  After he died his place was raided and work was stolen
user1: Oh yea, but Tesla's life ended in tragedy where I think Turing came out ok in the end.
user2: That is true
user2: Are we clear to click Finish Conversation?
user1: Tesla works could've put us years ahead in terms of science
user1: 'm not sure tbh
user1: my hit timer is at 27 mins
user1: not sure when we started
user2: Yah mine's at 29
user1: We had to do 25 right?
user2: I believe so
user2: and respond at least 12 times, which we have
user1: alright yea then we're done
user1: nice talking to ya
user1: good luck turkin out there
user2: Sounds good, you too

conversation:
user2: I do not think I have seen this movie
user2: Seems to have gotten a decent rating
user1: I have. I normally like Cumberbatch but this movie was boring.
user2: I like Knightley
user1: It's one of those critically acclaimed movies the general audience doesn't go for
user2: then I would probably find it boring as well
user1: I love the idea of code breaking, I think its hard to make a good movie about it though
user2: I'm not a big fan of historical movies
user1: I am. Wish it stuck more to the actual story of Turing, cause it is really fascinating.
user1: DO you normally like movies Cumberbatch is in?
user2: Dr strange was good I like those type movies
user2: What would have made this movie more exciting
user1: If it stuck closer to the actual story. I know a bit about Turing and it took major liberties with his bio.
user2: I don't know that I know anything about Turing
user1: I felt it missed a few beats where stuff dragged on
user1: He was an amazing codebreaker.
user2: I find a lot of historical movies have segments where it drags on
user2: gotcha. 
user1: It was amazing the machine he came up with all the back during WW2
user1: Way ahead of his time
user2: well that's cool. I had no idea. 
user1: The fact that they could not act on every decoded message was very interesting. Otherwise the Nazi's would know their code was broken and change it
user1: Their is a BBC version of the movie that I think is much better
user2: interesting 
user2: that's pretty awesome, the factual parts
user1: Cumberbatch is definitely the highlight of this one though. He really delves into the character.
user2: how was knightley
user1: She was good. Not her best role. I don't think it really fit her as well.
user2: I haven't seen her in anything lately
user1: True. I think she has shied away from the big roles now.
user1: I would like to see what the audience score for Imitation Game was compared to the critic score.
user2: isn't rotten tomatoes partly audience?

conversation:
user1: Hello have you ever seen The Imitation Game?
user2: I haven't, but I'd like to. Have you seen it?
user1: Yes. It is a American historical drama film from 2014. It is based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma
user1: It is about a British cryptanalyist Alan Turing. 
user2: I would like to learn more about Alan Turing. He seems like an interesting person
user1: He decrypted German intelligence codes for the British Government during the second world war.
user2: I have heard the movie takes some artistic license with the plotline
user1: Yes I forgot to mention that is loosely based on the true story. 
user1: Some critics said this direction was disappointing because the actual story is great. 
user2: It still seems like it would be interesting despite this being a bit disappointing.
user1: Yes. It got a 91% score on Rotten Tomatoes and had a Metacritic Score of 73/100.
user2: Do you agree with that rating?
user1: I have to agree because it was entertaining. 
user1: It starts off in 1951 so it is nice to learn about that time period. 
user1: They also show him in 1927 when he was young and bullied at boarding school.
user2: It's always good to learn about pieces of history that are not often known about or discussed.
user1: Yes, I believe our history classes are pretty stupid and only go into the "approved" topics. 
user1: I have seen so many World War 2 things but never heard about Turing before this.
user2: And really only the basics. I had heard of Alan Turing but only vaguely and not with much detail.
user1: Yes, the coded messages were a big part of the war. 
user1: The nazis used "The Enigma machine". That is what he helped break.
user2: Oh yes you get a big advantage if you decode your enemy's coded messages.
user1: He uses a machine called Christopher to try to decrypt Nazi messages.
user1: They tried to destroy the machine and fire him when it didn't work at first.
user1: Eventually he breaks Enigma but they decide they can't act on every decoded message or they will know their machine was broken. 
user2: That's interesting. It must have been hard to not act on things that could have been important.
user2: And to decide what to act on and what not to.
user2: It's cool that the film goes into Alan Turing's love for a man, Christopher Morcom, who the machine seems to be named after.
user1: Yes it is interesting that they threw that into this. 
user2: I'm glad they didn't erase that aspect of Turing's life
user2: as often happens in films
user1: Yes at least some things were kept accurate.
user1: An interesting part in the movie is when they find out one of the people Turing was working with was a soviet spy. I am not sure if that happened in real life.
user1: The soviet spy argues that they are on the same side and threatens to reveal his homosexuality if he turns him in.
user2: That must have been awful for Turing
user1: Yes, but eventually he just comes out anyways.
user2: That must have been terrifying given how people were towards being gay in that time period. 
user1: Yes, and after that everyone went their separate ways and the cryptographers destroyed their work. 
user2: Yeah, Turing went to an MI6 agent to try and reveal that the soviet spy was a spy. But learned he already knew that and the MI6 agent was the one who told the cryptographers to destroy their work. At least according to the film from what I've heard
user1: Yes that is what happened. Have a good one.
user2: You too

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hello

conversation:
user2: Hi..this movie was a drama
user1: Ya this is one of the most important movie
user2: Mitten tyldum is the director
user1: And rating is also good
user2: This is my favourite movie 
user1: I think this is a imitation game
user2: Ya ..ok bye
user1: Good bye

conversation:
user2: Hey! The movie we're gonna talk about is called 'The Imitation Game'.
user2: Care to hear some details?
user1: Sounds exciting! Please divulge.
user1: What is it about?
user2: Gladly! Well, the film is a Drama biopic directed by Morten Tyldum, and it is loosely based on the life of Alan Turing. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing who decrypted German intelligence does for the British government in WW2. 
user1: Hmm interesting. World War 2 sounds like a periodic action film. What is the genre of the film?
user2: The genre is drama, and it is a biopic because it details biographical information about Alan Turing.
user1: Wow. Must be quite fun. I have not heard of the director but I have heard of Benedict Cumberbatch. I like his films. What did you enjoy the most about this movie?
user2: Actually, what I enjoyed most was Benedict Cumberbatch's performance. He was excellent!
user2: Some have said it was "poignantly performed"!
user1: Cool. I like him too. Very good actor. I think there will be some Nazis in this film because you mentioned German intelligence. Any other famous actors in this one?
user2: Yes, it certainly involves Nazis. Other actors who you might know are Keira Knightley who plays Joan clarke, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander and Tom Goodman-Hill as Sgt. Staehl
user1: I really like those actors and actresses you named. Sounds like a great cast. Is this a violent film? Or one I can watch with kids?
user2: No, certainly not violent. This is a war film, in a sense, but minimal violence as it deals with the portrayal of turing who was working as a cryptanalyst. 
user1: Okay. I like laughing when watching films. Does it have funny parts?
user2: No, frankly it is a bit sad at points as it involves the death of Turing's romantic interest. 
user1: Oh. That sounds tragic. Would you call Turing a hero in the film?
user2: Yes, very much so. Turing was able to successfully decode German encrypted messages that allowed him to determine what the Germans were planning ahead of time. 
user1: Interesting. Would you say the film is representative of the real world? Did all this really happen?
user2: Well, mostly, but as critic Andrew Grant of Science News put it "... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license -- which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling."
user1: Alright. Is there a villain in the film? Who is the villain?
user2: There is no direct villain, just the Germans.
user1: Haha. Are there any characters of color?
user2: None that I am aware of, no.
user1: Does the film mention any government conspiracies?
user2: There are conspiracies, yes. In fact, at one point Turing discovers that a member of his cryptography team is a Soviet spy. Now, the Soviets were on the side of the British, but Turing was alarmed to find this information out. You could call that a conspiracy in itself.  
user1: Wow. Very captivating. I like how you described the scene. What particular scene stands out from "The Imitation Game"?
user2: My favorite scene has to be when Turing is able to finally crack the Enigma codes the Germans were using with his cryptographic machines. Very thrilling!
user1: Yes, sounds very nice. Does the film touch on major themes such as social equality?
user2: Not quite, but it does address Turing's homosexuality which is a current social topic of discussion. 
user1: Okay. Thanks.

conversation:
user1: Wow, this movie has really great reviews1
user2: Both critics and user ratings are pretty high for a biographical movie like that.
user1: yeah, its described as a thriller, i love those kind of movies
user2: I think I would like the historical part most, since I liked other movies about Bletchley Park and code cracking.
user1: its interesting because it seems the movie doesn't follow the history very closely.
user2: I guess the writers needed to make it more interesting to the general public. The emotional content may have been more important than accuracy.
user1: yeah, that
user1: yeah, thats a good point
user2: If it's watchable, I'll try to look over the flaws.
user2: It looks good anyways.
user1: yes it does
user2: wasn't the topic supposed to change after 3 exchanges?
user1: yeah the document changed, but its on the same movie
user1: it showed an additional paragraph at the top i believe
user2: So it's one of those movies that starts from the end, then tells a story in flashback? 
user2: It's been 84 years, like Titanic lol.
user1: in a way, because I think you can understand whats happening but it gives more info into the main character's background with the flashbacks and provide more context.
user1: like because of the flashback, we know why he named the machine Christopher
user2: Creating a machine to crack Germany's Enigma was probably groundbreaking when Turing did it.
user1: yes, its pretty amazing. Even if the movie departs from history a bit, the whole situation is incredible.
user2: The plot shown in no. 2 in the document makes the key scenes above it pretty sad, particularly Turing's suicide.
user2: I guess he wasn't well known to the public since his death was treated like a regular crime
user1: where did you read the part about his suicide?
user2: So they destroyed everything about the work they did breaking codes to keep it a secret.
user1: i wonder how all of this got out to even be recorded in history?
user2: No wonder he wasn't more well known.
user2: Maybe it came out later. This movie has a lot going on. WWII, spies, code breaking, broken hearts...
user1: I wonder why he even marries Keira Knightley's character in the first place
user2: and a code breaking machine named Christopher. 
user2: He might have liked her, even if not in the same way she felt for him.
user1: since it was a crime at that time, maybe it was also a good cover for himself
user2: Probably not  good idea to withhold that kind of information from a potential spouse.
user2: That seems possible.
user2: ok, bye.

conversation:
user2: Good Evening 
user1: Good Evening
user2: Have you seen this movie by chance?
user1: Yes I have
user2: I have not, interesting review.  I will have to check it out!
user1: I liked it very much. It is about Alan Turing and his work during the World War II
user2: I'm a big history buff.  Did you agree with the review?
user1: The review (Introduction) looks good. The critical response varies. I do agree with the description as a "superb thriller".
user2: More incentive to watch it!  Don't know how I missed one of the top movies in 2014:-) I love all the actors also!
user1: Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley are amazing.
user2: I'm interested in reading his Biography now and comparing historical accuracy.  
user2: After reading the last comment that is.
user1: One of the reviews says that the movie takes liberties with historic material.
user2: Saw that, like most movies I suppose. 
user1: Yes, all historical dramas have to add something to make a story more dramatic
user2: I have worked with Cryptography while in the Coast Guard.  Although I personally didn't enjoy it, found it to be a fascinating science.  
user1: Then you probably understand in details how the Enigma machine works.
user2: Yes, some of the equipment I worked with was WWII era technology. Gotta love the Coast Guard budget. The Wind Talkers story has alway fascinated me also.
user2: It says Turing was bullied in school?
user1: There also was a dramatic line about Alan Turing's personal life, his relationships with his school friend Christopher and his colleague (played by Knightley)
user1: Yes, it does
user1: It depicts him as socially awkward, I have no idea how historically accurate it is
user2: That's why I'd like to read his Bio also! 
user2: He sounds like very courageous man on a professional and personal level.
user1: Yes, he was a very interesting person. In the movie, he had to make some difficult decision about saving ships or not. 
user2: Do you know if he won any awards in real life for his contributions?
user1: The Instructions to the HIT state that we are only supposed to talk about the content of the article and not about our personal knowledge. I hope we will not be punished for this. The article does not say anything about any rewards (at least, for now), but as much as I know, Turing's machine and Turing's test are well known and are being studied as an important part of computer science.
user2: true hope we stayed on topic! 
user1: Yes. Also there was a complicated line about a Soviet spy, who was at the same time working for England too. 
user2: Sounds beautifuly written, as stated in article!
user1: Yes. But Alan was very unhappy personally. He could not forget his school friend, he married Clarke without love, and even after that he had to break up with her to save her. 
user1: Since User 2 has left the chat I hope it is safe for me to press "Finish Conversation", isn't it? Thank you.

conversation:
user1: This movie seems to have good reviews
user2: Agreed, I like the rating from Glamour. I'm a huge fan of their content.
user1: Do you like Benedict Cumberbatch as an actor? 
user2: Honestly, I don't recognize the name. I am a fan of Keira Knightley. How about you?
user1: Yeah, he is a good actor, he's done some British TV as well. I like Keira Knightley as well. Have you seen any other movies by this director? 
user2: No, actually I haven't. Have you seen this movie?
user1: Yes I have, it was very nice, although I didn't think it was very true to the life of Alan Turing. How about you? 
user2: I'm more of a horror fan, but it does sound very interesting. So you're familiar with Turing?
user1: Somewhat, yes. You said that you like horror; how about biopics? 
user2: Not so much, but I do find it interesting that Turing decrypted German intelligence code. 
user2: It says Turing was bullied in school. That's awful.
user1: Well some of the views state that the movie took some artistic license, so I am not sure whether that is true. How do you feel about the movie having so much artistic license? 
user2: I think they should stick to the facts more and not sensationalize so much. I see this has reference to the war in it. Did the movie have a lot of war scenes in it?
user1: Not really, it was mostly centered around the research facility where Turing worked with his team. I think there were no war scenes in it at all. Do the war scenes bother you? 
user2: I don't like to see war scenes when it has to do with Nazis. The Enigma machine sounds interesting?
user1: Yeah, the Enigma machine was definitely the highlight of the movie. How do you feel about the fact that Turing was gay? Do you think they should have omitted that fact in the movie? 
user2: No, if that's really who he was, I guess it would be important to his character. It sounds like he might have should have kept it secret back then though.
user1: Yes I guess he wasn't secretive enough in his real life. But don't you think that the exploration of his sexuality distracts from the message of the movie? Or do you think it actually aids the movie's aim? 
user2: No, in this day and age, I guess it gives his character more dimension. It explains why he names the machine after Christopher I guess. He must have looked pretty suspicious for the police to investigate him because someone broke into his home.
user1: Maybe they didn't believe him when he told them about his work for the government and it seemed suspicious to them. 
user1: Why do you think they made this movie? 
user2: Maybe so, have you seen the BBC drama Breaking the Code?
user1: No, I haven't. Is it similar to this movie? 
user2: That's what I was wondering. I feel sorry for Clarke. He shouldn't have lied to her.
user2: I think they made the movie because Turing was definitely multi-faceted. He seems to have had quite an interesting life.
user1: I agree, but at least she had the job opportunity to work with him
user1: Definitely. How do you feel about Turing revealing that Cairncross is a Soviet spy? 
user2: Well, when you think about it, Cairncross in a way, like Turing, was pretending to be something he really wasn't. So that's kind of an interesting irony.
user1: Yeah, I didn't see that connection before. 
user1: How do you feel about the fact that the British did not act on every decoded message? Do you think it was ethically correct to pick and choose which information was used for their benefit? 
user2: I've enjoyed the chat. I think I will have to go find this movie and check it out now.
user1: Definitely, it's a nice movie. It was nice chatting with you

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Yes I guess so! It has a 91 percent from rotten tomatoes!
user2: That is a pretty good score from them!
user1: I've never seen it, but I have heard good things
user2: I do enjoy shows that have a historical element to them. I like that it is based on a biography.
user2: Have you ever heard of Alan Turing?
user1: He was a computer scientist
user1: and mathmatician
user2: That is interesting!
user1: is he where the Turing test comes from?
user2: Ohhhhh, yes, I think you are onto something. 
user1: Are you familiar with the Turing test?
user2: I do enjoy historical movies that pertain to Nazi Germany. The premise sounds intriguing. 
user2: I am Not! Are You?
user1: Yes i am , basically it is the question if a computer can imitate perfectly a human, how would you be able to tell the difference?
user1: for example, How do i know that you are really a human and not an AI?
user2: Ohhh that is interesting!
user2: Learn something new everyday. :)
user1: i will definitely have to watch this movie.
user2: It looks as though the movie is about his invention.
user2: Same!
user2: I wonder how Benedict Cumberbatch is at portraying Alan Turing.
user2: I do like his acting.
user1: It looks like some critics think that the director did not do the story justice.
user1: I like his acting too he can really bring a character to life. 
user2: I agree!!! I guess we will just have to see for ourselves right?!
user2: Ohhh that is pretty wild that Caircross turns out to be a Soviet spy. That is a surprising twist in the story.
user2: I cannot believe that all of their hard work had to be destroyed in the end!
user2: This movie seems fascinating.
user2: I am definitely going to have to watch it.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Have you seen the Imitation Game?
user2: Hi
user2: NO
user1: It is a great historical movie during WW2 ear
user1: *era
user1: It was a great movie, showing the method to try and break the enigma code, that the Germans used to communicate orders and plans to each other.
user1: Do you know who Benedict Cumberpatch is ?
user1: You have to respond for this movie study can progress, with dialog going back and forth.
user2: The movie it self was a great hit it seems, with wonderful actors and actresses.  He is an all time favorite of mine.
user1: I thought you said you had never seen the movie?

conversation:
user2: I really liked The Imitation Game. What about you?
user1: Yes, I really enjoyed it as well.
user2: Do you typically like historical dramas?
user1: I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and thought that he did an excellent job.
user2: Historicals aren't always my favorite, but I generally agree with Rotten Tomatoes, so I thought their score made it a pretty safe bet. 
user1: I've liked a few historical dramas that I've seen. I agree. I always check Rotten Tomatoes before watching a movie. If it doesn't have a good score, then I typically decide not to watch it. 
user2: Keira Knightley usually doesn't do movies that bomb either.  I think they worked well together. 
user1: She's one of my favorite actresses. Did you read Andrew Hodges biography Alan Turing: The Enigma before watching the movie?  
user2: I did not.  I was familiar with the story, but not enough to know exactly how accurate the movie was. I felt like it was an entertaining movie, even though apparently they took some liberties in the accuracy of the story they told. 
user2: We seem to be stuck on this first document...
user1: Haha, I know...
user2: *sigh*   So... would you agree with Empire as describing it as a thriller? While it had its tense moments, I don't know that I'd categorize it like that.
user1: Yeah, I don't think I wold categorize it as a thriller, but I agree with Glamour on it being described as an instant classic. 
user1: I didn't like the scene where Christopher dies before Turing can confess his love to him. So sad!
user2: Makes you wonder how Turking's story could have played out, had that not happened. 
user2: Errr... Turing. (habit)I wonder what characters were just entirely made up! I wasn't aware that any were.
user2: They all seemed to fit in perfectly, and be very believable. 
user1: Yeah, its hard to know. Morten Tyldum did a great job directing the film
user2: He certainly did.   And I think Matthew Goode was perfect as Hugh Alexander. Now that I've seen those people in those roles, I can't imagine anyone else playing them. 
user2: I loved that Turing named his machine "Christopher". Such a sweet tribute.
user1: Yes. I loved that. Were you surprised when Turing proposed marriage to Clarke?
user2: Very! And also surprised at how quickly he confirmed his homosexuality to someone. I mean... during their reception? He was a bold man. 
user1: Yes, I'm sure that was not easy to do! Good thing Caimcross was trustworthy.
user2: Yeah, back then that could have resulted in a vastly different outcome for Turing.  I'm sure that Joan Clarke would have appreciated the heads up too though. 
user2: Smart thinking on his part that he didn't decode EVERY message, to keep the Germans in the dark about their codes being broken. 
user1: Yes! Thankfully he realized that. The circumstances could have been devastating. He was a smart man. Good thing he didn't end up getting fired!
user2: I'm sure Turing was devastated when he realized Caimcross was a Soviet spy. I didn't see that coming!
user1: Me neither! That was so disappointing. And it was so sad that it resulted in him telling Joan that he didn't care for her in order to protect her. 
user2: Turing accomplished so many things. It's a shame his life was wrought with so many tragedies.
user1: Yes, having to destroy his work and not see any of his team mates again must have been so difficult. 
user2: We are 43 minutes into this. :)
user1: :) I'm pretty much out of things to say!
user2: Right? We could have watched the movie, just about. 
user1: Haha, true!
user2: Ooh our Finish button is available finally. :)  Thanks. Good luck!

conversation:
user1: The movie is The Imitation Game. I have not seen it, have you?
user2: No I have not even heard of it
user1: It was a book of the same name, it is a drama and biography. Do you like movies in those genres?
user2: depends, as long as its not too touchy feely. Whats it about
user1: It is about Alan Turing, a guy who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. I think it is supposed to be interesting and thrilling/
user1: The actors are Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. Have you heard of them?
user2: I like those type of dramas, they are usually interesting to me as I like hi
user2: Ive heard of keira knightly but would have to see there faces as I'm not usually good at knowing the actors
user1: It has very high scores on different move critic websites. Do you usually follow movie critics recommendations? 
user2: Yes and no, I look at what critics say and also what regular folks who have seen the movie. Critics don't always have the same taste as I do
user2: I try to gage from the previews as well plus what the story is about
user1: I agree with you. Some critics were upset that the movie made a lot of changes from the real life story. I think that is ok to do to make a movie flow better, how about you?
user2: Changes are fine, if I want the details I will read the biography lol. Movies cant tell everything as they are short on time and have to entertain you so a little creative changes should be done
user2: They don't make too many historical movies as they usually do not make money. these days its comic book heroes that are raking in the big buck
user2: Do you like movies like this?
user1: I really enjoy biography movies. Especially ones like this that involve bigger world events.
user1: Apparently part of this movie involves Turing (the main guy) being in love with his male friend. I wonder if that would be too touchy-feely for you to enjoy it, like you said earlier?
user2: As long as it not the whole movie and does put in enough about what they actually did I'm okay with it
user1: This movie is set in Bletchley Park, England. I don't know about you, but I have never been to England. 
user2: I was in London when I was little but only for a day. remember that everything was really expensive as we had to stay a day for a layover. don't know if id want to visit seems too crowded fro me. I prefer someplace warm
user1: Haha that's fair
user2: how about you ever visit Europe
user1: I have been to France.
user2: Paris>
user1: Yes.
user1:  The codebreaking machine in the film is nicknamed Christopher. I think that's silly, do you?
user2: He probably liked winny the pooh - Christopher robin there was no internet back then so using your head was necessary
user1: That's a good conclusion.
user1: Based on what I've told you about the movie, are you interested in seeing it?
user2: Id say when it comes out on Netflix or amazon and I have nothing better to do I would. However it has to catch my attention at the beginning for me to watch a movie all the way through. I've watched some stinkers just because I wanted to see the end as the start caught my attention
user1: I think it is on netflix already, as the movie came out in 2014. I agree I would watch it for free rather than paying to rent it individually.
user1: The more I read of the plot, the more interesting it becomes. But I don't want to spoil it for you
user2: I only go to see kids movies these days as I have been burned too many times seeing a great preview and then spend the money and the movie a big pile of poo
user1: I have not seen a movie in the movie theater in a long time. 
user2: They are a lot better now. the seats are fake leather and super wide and you can lean it back like a lazyboy. 
user2: nice talking to you

user1: Hi How's it going?
user2: Good, and you?
user1: Not bad, we're supposed to talk about a movie I guess.
user2: yes, tell me about the movie.
user1: What movie were you asked to talk about?
user2: i was not given any information. i am to ask you about the movie to see if i would enjoy seeing it.
user1: We're going to talk about The Avengers (2012)
user2: Oh, cool!
user1: Do you like action movies?
user2: yes! is there a lot of action in the Avengers? 
user1: It's a Marvel movie, so yes. It's full of action.
user2: cool. is it appropriate for any age?
user1: No, I think it's PG-13, so older kids and adults.
user2: ok.are there a lot of big actors in it?
user1: Yes, have you ever heard of Marvel movies?
user1: There are quite a few big name actors.
user2: no i have not.
user2: like who?
user1: What movies are you interested in?
user2: i like anything that is face paced and interesting
user1: This movie would definitely fall into that category of fast paced and interesting.
user2: how long is it?
user1: 2 hours 23 minutes
user1: I found it very entertaining.
user2: is it funny?
user1: Yep it has a lot of gags and amusements. Would you mind telling me how old you are?
user2: my age is not part of this topic
user1: The special effects are also top notch.
user2: so they do not look bad?
user1: They look great.
user2: i hate when cgi is terrible
user1: Where did you go, bro?
