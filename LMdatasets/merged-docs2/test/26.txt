cast:
Ryan Gosling as Sebastian Wilder
Emma Stone as Mia Dolan
John Legend as Keith
Callie Hernandez as Tracy

critical response:
succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama, a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity 
Chazelle has crafted that rare thing, a genuinely romantic comedy, and as well, a rhapsody in blue, red, yellow and green.
La La Land may look like the world that we dream about, but it also understands the cruelty that can come out of (or undermine) those dreams; it's shot in CinemaScope, and yet it's still an intimate masterpiece.
the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment
...the movie traffics in the bittersweet happiness of treasuring things that are vanishing, like the unrealized future imagined in the climatic dance number, or those inky, star-filled dance floors that go on forever in old movies, or Hollywood musicals themselves. Or jazz: Sebastian has an early moment at a nightclub where he passionately sticks up for the music he loves.  It's dying on the vine, 
his quest (and eventual success) to save the traditionally black musical genre from extinction, seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal.
the movie sags badly in the middle, like a worn-out mattress that needs new springs
 the film is a little dull, that the two leads' singing and dancing aren't exceptional, and that Sebastian is a jazz snob and Mia's character lacks depth.

description:
During a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to stick to the setlist of traditional Christmas songs. Mia overhears the music as she passes by ('Mia and Sebastian's Theme'). Moved, she enters the restaurant, but Sebastian is fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off. Months later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; she teases him by requesting 'I Ran (So Far Away)', a song he considers an insult for 'a serious musician'. After the gig, the two walk to their cars, lamenting each other's company despite the chemistry between them ('A Lovely Night'). 
After more failed auditions, Mia decides, at Sebastian's suggestion, to write a one-woman play. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club ('Summer Montage'), and the two move in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in his jazz fusion band, where he will be offered a steady income. Although he is dismayed by the band's pop style, Sebastian signs after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but when Mia attends one of their concerts ('Start a Fire') she is disturbed, knowing Sebastian does not enjoy their music. 
During the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument; she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Mia leaves, insulted and frustrated. Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a band photo shoot that he had previously forgotten. The play is a disaster; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments. Sebastian attempts to apologize to Mia for missing the play, but she is unwilling to forgive him and ends their relationship. Despondent and unable to pay the theater back, Mia moves back home to Boulder City, Nevada.

user1: This film has a great rotten tomatoes score
user1: What did you think of the cast?
user2: Those scores are often inflated by the studios themselves. I don't always trust RT
user2: I thought the cast was good. 
user1: Do you watch alot of musicals?
user2: Do you typically like musicals?
user2: I watch some, but I'm very picky about them
user1: Not really, I'll watch them on occasion.
user2: I don't like when they sing the dialogue
user1: Same
user1: What about Dramas?
user2: I'm a movie buff in general
user1: What was your favorite scene? I liked the one while they were doing a gig at a restaurant.
user2: I heard good things about La La Land, but haven't see it IRL yet
user2: How were the songs?
user2: Sappy and showtune-like?
user1: He was playing in a1980's pop cover band..
user1: not bad though
user2: Sounds like Music & Lyrics
user1: Do you agree with the rating? 
user2: Seemed inflated to me, but I still need to see it
user1: I thought Emma Stone did a fantastic job though
user2: Jazz Pianist doesn't get me excited
user2: I like John Legend's music and voice though
user1: Yeah, one of the critics said Mia's character was a little dull and Sebastian is a jazz snob
user1: Me too
user2: IMDB ratings usually aren't that high
user2: I'll have to check it out. Kind of forgot about this one
user2: Maybe on a date night
user2: I've never heard of the director Damien Chazelle
user1: Neither have I, but with scores like that I'll have to check out some other films
user1: I really liek Ryan Goslings character as well
user1: I didn't like the scene where Mia left him at the end though, it was sad 
user2: spoiler alert!!!!
user1: Still worth watching

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you? Have you seen any good movies recently?
user2: Can you tell me the name of any good movie you have seen recently?
user1: Hello! 
user1: Yes, I just watched La La Land
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: No, I haven't. Is it any good?
user1: Well, I don't know how you feel about romantic comedies 
user1: I'm usually not a huge fan but it seemed very genuine 
user2: I like them. What's this one about?
user1: Also just visually beautiful 
user2: In what sense? Where does it take place?
user1: It's about a actress and a musician.
user1: they meet and fall in love in LA while pursing their dreams
user2: It sounds like something I would watch. Than you for the recommendation!
user1: Yeah, it has a bunch of great scenes where the two don't quite connect 
user1: like one where the girl, Mia hears the boy,  Sebastian playing the piano in a bar but he brushes her off 
user2: How do they fall in love then?
user1: Well they meet for a second time at a party and Seb is in a 80's cover band. They have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while
user1: Then they slowly start falling for each other over the course of a few dates
user1: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the leads
user1: I wasn't sure about those two to start out with, they just didn't seem like they'd be good together 
user2: Are there any other famous actors beside Emma and Ryan?
user1: John Legend has a small role
user2: Does he get to sing?
user1: A bit. He has a duet with Emma. He also sings a song or two by himself 
user2: Do Emma and Ryan sing well in the movie?
user1: They weren't the best signers I've ever heard but it wasn't like Le Mes bad
user1: Sebastian character is sort of annoying. I mean he's into jazz and is suppose to be this great musician, but is a compete snob about it.  Def not a likable character even towards the end really 
user2: What about Emma's character, is she likable?
user1: She is. I enjoy this section where she attempts to do a women show and I was caught up in the emotions during this scene. She's such a great actress that the execution is so believable it sounds like a story of a friend of a friend 
user1: During this time, Seb feels so out of sorts. the band he's in is finding success in pop music but because he's such a jazz pureist, he wants to quit
user2: Do they make it in the end, both as a couple and in their respective careers?
user1: He doesn't because he loves Mia so much he wants to make her proud
user1: Sadly no. they drift away as their careers go in different directions. He misses an important play and she moves back home
user2: So it ends a bit sadly then. But I guess that's how real life goes.
user1: it's a big "wrong place wrong time" kind of ending, which sucks because you really start to root for them. 
user1: Yeah, I really liked the ending, while it wasn't perfect, it was real
user1: Something you don't get with movies most of the time
user2: I agree
user1: One of the things I wasn't a fan of was the fact that Mia  didn't really have any development. 
user2: In what sense?
user2: Career wise or personal like?
user1: More personal really. She lacked depth. She was just an actress who tried and failed many times then found success 
user1: But we weren't shown how she found the *thing* that helped her grow and become a better actress
user2: I might have to watch it to see what you mean. I think failing and trying again shows real depth.
user1: the movie just jumped forward passed that. Seb didn't have much growth either. He stayed a jazz snob
user2: Ok. Thank you. Bye!
user1: I think you should. it's an enjoyable watch that makes you think. Bye!

conversation:
user2: Hello! Have you seen the movie La La Land?
user1: No I haven't.
user1: What is it about?
user2: It's really good! It's a musical/romantic comedy about two people who fall in love in Hollywood.
user1: Who are the main actors?
user2: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the two main characters.
user1: Are they the characters that fall in love?
user2: They are. One's a jazz pianist and the other is an aspiring actress.
user1: What is the conflict?
user2: There isn't really a major conflict, the movie just follows these two characters as they fall in love.
user2: There are several dance numbers that are really well done.
user1: Is it a musical?
user2: Yes, it is a musical.
user1: Are there any current pop stars who are in it?
user2: They meet for the first time when he's playing a jazz improvisation and the music draws her into the restaurant.
user2: John Legend is in the film.
user1: Is it love at first sight? 
user2: Kind of. She falls in love with his music, then gets to know him better and better throughout the film.
user1: Who is the director of the film?
user2: It's directed by Damien Chazelle.
user1: Never heard of them. What other movies have they been the director?
user2: He directed Whiplash as well, which is another film about music.
user2: I like it because the characters are falling in love as they're following their dreams.
user1: Do you know who does the choreography for La La Land? 
user2: I don't know.
user2: What kind of movies do you like?
user1: I enjoy things where I have to think. Or that have strange plot twists. Like Memento. Or Predestination. Where you don't understand everything until the very end.
user1: Are there other movies like La La Land that you could compare to it?
user2: Cool! Well then you might not like La La Land. It's a bit more straightforward and focuses more on relationships and the characters.
user1: I like all kinds of movies. Are there other films that you could compare La La Land to?
user2: It's kind of a unique type of movie. It has a lot in common with movies from the 1920s that have lots of dance and musical numbers.
user2: It's very well-made. Lots of critics seem to have enjoyed it.

conversation:
user1: Hi, how are you?
user2: Good how about you
user2: Have you ever seen jaws?
user1: No I haven't. Is it good?
user2: It is amazing. It's about a man trying to save his beach side town from a crazy shark
user2: What about LA LA land? Have you seen that?
user1: Would you say it has a happy ending to it?
user1: I haven't seen LA LA land either. Which one would you recommend?
user2: Yes. They kill the Shark and get to relax and be happy in the end
user1: Aw man, spoilers haha
user2: Honestly I would recommend jaws. It's such a great classic movie
user1: Why not La La land? Do you not like it?
user1: What genre is La La land? 
user2: LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews. I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1
user2: LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy
user1: Hmm, you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending. Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy, is there any romance in Jaws?
user1: And is LA LA Land based on a real story?
user2: No. Jaws has little romance

conversation:
user1: Hi. What movie are we discussing?
user2: I think La la land
user1: I have not seen it yet, but I might. What kind of movie is it?
user2: You haven't read document
user1: I don't have a document to read
user2: It is romantic comedy movie
user1: Any big name actors in it?
user2: Emma stones is actress
user1: Does the movie have good reviews?
user2: No actually, I also haven't watched this movie
user1: Ok, maybe I will check it out
user2: What else

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: I know a movie you may like
user2: What's the movie about?
user1: It's actually sort of a musical
user2: That's great! I love musicals. Are there any big name actors in the movie?
user1: Ryan Gosling
user2: Nice! It looks like the movie has pretty great ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and other review sites
user1: It also has Emma Stone
user2: Do you think you would like the movie?
user1: I would love it.
user2: I think I would love it as well
user1: The critics love it.
user1: do you like dancing in movies?
user2: I do! 
user2: What do you think of the two key scenes? Which one sounds more interesting to you?
user1: I would like the first one just to see someone playing music soulfully
user2: I agree. I think that scene sounds interesting
user1: I just saw it has John Legend in it
user1: Isn't he, like, a legend or something?
user2: Haha I think so! 
user2: I think the new scene, where Mia decides to write a one-woman play sounds cool
user1: It's in LA.
user2: I do like the setting
user1: She does sound like a cool character
user1: I'm more of a New York person myself
user2: They both sound interesting. New York is a great place as well! 
user1: LA is so flat isn't it?
user1: And all that nasty stuff in the news about Hollywood
user2: Yeah, it is. And expensive! 
user1: The warm climate is appealing though
user1: Do you like jazz?
user2: I can appreciate jazz, but it's not one of my favorite genres. Do you?
user1: not my favorite either
user1: I prefer more forethought and craftsmanship in my music
user1: improv doesn't suit me
user2: I agree with that. I do appreciate that a contemporary movie is bringing jazz into it. Jazz isn't usually found in mainstream movies 
user1: gotta go. peace.

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: hey, what's up
user1: have you watched la la land before?
user2: Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it
user1: I agree with most of the critics in the paper
user2: Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream
user2: I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling. 
user1: yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers
user2: Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only. 
user2: It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie
user1: would you do that, if you were in his position?
user2: I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship
user1: yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different
user2: I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing
user1: do you usually watch musicals?
user2: Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship
user1: I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams
user1: they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot
user2: Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big
user1: i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer
user1: i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot
user2: I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams
user2: What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?
user1: it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them
user1: but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful
user2: It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada
user1: i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams
user1: it really was sad
user2: I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all
user1: would you say that was the low point in the movie?
user2: Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims
user1: i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend
user2: I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship
user1: yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending
user2: I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film. 
user1: i'm curious, are you an ai
user1: if so, i was completely fooled
user2: I am not! 
user2: But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all
user1: yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.
user1: he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film
user2: I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada
user1: yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option
user1: *about it
user2: I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her. 
user1: although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams
user1: the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad
user2: I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end. 
user2: It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!
user1: you guys have a pretty good ai system
user1: i was actually completely fooled

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: Hi, I think you should watch LaLa Land. It sounds like it is an amazing movie
user2: Who stars in the movie?
user1: Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend
user2: I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?
user1: Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.
user2: I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.
user2: Where does the movie take place?
user1: He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles. 
user2: Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?
user1: She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams. 
user2: What part does John Legend play?
user1: I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician
user2: What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?
user1: Yes I think it is modern time period
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship
user2: Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.
user1: Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.
user2: Do you know what the play is about?
user1: No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in 
user2: Is there alot of dancing also?
user1: I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical
user2: I do too, if it is done well.
user2: Does Emma Stone sing as well?
user1: When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful
user2: That doesn't bode well for the relationship.
user1: I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!
user2: Does he go with her to Nevada?
user1: No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust
user2: It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.
user1: John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!
user2: I bet you are right.
user1: I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it. 
user2: Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.
user1: I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film. 
user2: Sounds great.

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: hello
user1: what's the name of the movie?
user2: the name of the movie is La La Land
user1: Is it a good movie?
user2: Yes! It's a very inspirational and uplifting movie--about two people getting in touch with their dreams.
user1: can you get me an outline about the movie?
user1: You still there?
user2: The movie is about an aspiring jazz pianist, Ryan Gosling, and an aspiring actress, Emma Stone. They meet and fall in love in Los Angeles--but with time their dreams gradually create distance between them. It deals with the prospect of choosing your dreams over love--because life is all about timing, really.
user1: seems a good movie
user2: Yeah, it is. Do you have any other questions?
user1: Yeah any academy awards for the movie?
user2: Yes, it won several.
user2: It also has a 92% rating on rotten tomatoes.
user1: that's great
user2: :-) Yep.
user1: Did it get any Oscars? 
user2: Yes. 6 wins from the Oscars--the first film to ever achieve as such.
user1: So one of the best movies ever
user2: Well that's subjective--I watched it and thought it was a little overrated. Just because it was slightly cliched, and I personally feel that I've seen better films. 
user2: But nonetheless it's still worth the watch.
user1: Will love to do that, Is it available online?
user2: Yes, for sure.
user1: Where can I watch it?
user2: You can watch it on Hulu, it's also been playing quite a few times on HBO so if you don't want to pay for it online the TV's an option as well.
user2: Still there?
user1: Will check TV, If it is available and if not available will try to pay and watch. If I pay for it will it be worth?
user2: I recommend it. If you've never seen it, it's definitely a film that deserves to be watched at least once.
user2: You might be aware of this already but it's a musical.
user1: I am not a big fan of musical films
user2: Yeah me neither! But this film was actually good despite the musical aspect of it. 
user2: Also, if you're a fan of photography or art--you'll really appreciate how nicely the film was shot.
user1: I am a fan of photography, but not of art
user2: Yeah then you'll really enjoy the cinematography of the film. The scenes were filmed very beautifully. The lighting, the backdrop, the placement--all of it!
user2: Is that all your questions?
user1: Yeah I think so , Thank you for your information

conversation:
user1: What's the name of the movie?
user2: Hi! It's La La Land!
user2: It came out a couple of years ago.
user1: Who are the actors in it?
user2: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads. John Legend is also in it as a secondary character.
user1: Was it funny?
user2: It has mixed reviews, some say it was very pleasurable, others think it was dull at times.
user1: What's the plot?
user2: Ryan Goslings character, Sebastian, is trying to become a credible jazz pianist. Emma Stone's character is an aspiring actress. 
user2: It is a musical based in Los Angeles about reaching one's dreams.
user1: Will they fall in love?
user2: Yes, it is a romantic comedy, but it is not love at first sight.
user1: Is it appropriate for children?
user2: It is hard to say. Children would probably enjoy the music, though it is a romantic comedy so keep in mind elements of romance.
user1: I see.
user1: Has it won any awards?
user2: I'm not sure if it has won awards but it does have very high ratings on popular movie sites like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB
user1: What is John Legend's role?
user2: He plays Sebastian's old friend Keith. He is in a successful band and he asks Sebastian to join in.
user1: Oh okay. Are there dance numbers involved?
user2: Yes, there is dancing, but some have said the dancing is not "exceptional"
user1: Is it available on DVD now?
user2: I am unable to determine if it is out on DVD at the moment.
user1: How much did it cost to make the movie?
user2: I'm not sure about that but something interesting about it is that after Mia and Sebastian fall in love, they get in a huge fight, and Mia moves back home to Boulder City from Los Angeles.
user2: Thus, ending their relationship.
user1: Well that sounds like a great spoiler ;)
user1: Are they both successful in their chosen field at the end?
user2: Talk about spoilers!
user2: You will just have to watch the movie to see!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hello have you seen la la land
user2: Not yet, but I want to
user2: Who are the starring actors?
user1: It's a great new musical drama with emma stone and ryan gosling
user1: Do you like jazz music?
user2: I like jazz music. Is that part of the movie?
user1: The director, Damien Chazelle, did a great job of blending romantic comedy, and a musical 'jazzy' rhapsody
user2: Is the whole movie singing?
user1: it is not, it alternates climatic dance numbers with typical hollywood musical thematics with classical sotry telling
user2: Is it set in modern day?
user1: I recommend the movie even though it sags in the middle a bit 
user2: What makes you say that?
user1: Maybe I can tell you a little bit about the first scene
user2: Okay
user1: Sabastian (Gosling) is a young artist with a strong passion for Jazz and Mia (Stone) falls in love with it while listening to it during one of his performances
user2: Oh, so Ryan Gosling plays a famous musician?
user1: However Sebastian cannot launch his own Jazz brand and is forced to work in other music genres for a living, which causes him to be very fought, yes he is a great Jazz pianist and singer
user2: Is it a long movie?
user1: Yes, being a musical is longer that most movies
user2: How many musical numbers are in it?
user1: I could not tell you but there are at least 6 I believe
user1: It was very well received with a IMBD core of 8.3
user2: Did you like the songs?
user1: Yes, they are very catchy. However the middle lost a bit of steam, also to go along with the development of the characters
user1: the main characters argues since Mia wants to pursue her career as an aspiring actress
user2: Who is the producer?
user1: I am unsure
user2: I should have seen it in theaters. When did it come out>
user1: The whole thing is highly entertaining, was released in 2016
user2: Ah, then I can probably find it on DVD
user1: some critics claimed is was 2016's most seriously pleasurable entertainment
user1: ahah
user1: Yes probably by now
user2: Thanks for helping me!
user1: Of course, I hope you will watch it
user2: I think I will
user2: Goodbye!
user1: Bye

conversation:
user2: So did you like this movie?
user1: I haven't seen it but from what I read here it sounds good
user2: yeah, i was apprehensive about watching a musical but the reviews were good
user1: The line of it being the years most pleasurable entertainment sounds interesting 
user2: yeah i agree . i wonder what they are basing that on, ie what makes it so pleasurable. i wonder if it has a good soundtrack?
user2: have you seen other movies with Ryan Gosling?
user2: Ryan Gosling*
user1: Yes I have. The fact that he is in this movie is a big draw for me
user1: The cast in general is very strong
user2: which movies of his have you seen?
user2: yeah i dont think ive seen any other movies with john legend (isn't he a singer?)
user1: Well The Notebook is a big one
user2: ohhh yeah! i forgot about the notebook
user1: He was in The Big SHort as well
user2: oh that was a good one
user1: But yes John Legend as an actor...
user1: I can't picture that
user2: yeah
user1: From the documents provided it seems that Ryan's character is a bit of a jerk
user2: so in the last line they say that the lead is a "jazz snob." wonder what that means?
user2: yeah i was just reading that
user1: He is a jazz snob and she lacks depth. but it has great reviews?
user2: perhaps the other reviewers are reading too into it. i mean, anyone can be called a snob of anything is theyre deeply passionate about something that others are "meh" about.
user1: Perhaps he is just more focused on his career and she is a distraction for him. Some people find it difficult to be upfront about that sort of thing
user2: that's true; you're right. so they say that the female lead lacks depth. i wonder what that means. there is a consensus in film theory that most female characters in film lack depth and their purpose is to allow the male lead to grow and develop his character. what do you think of that?
user1: Yes the next section he accuses her of liking him more when he was unsuccessful. Perhaps when he had more time for her and no competition for his attention 
user2: do we know when the film takes place?
user1: I haven't heard that about female leads. I do think a lot of movies have female stereotypes. 
user2: yeah, it's interestng to read about. look into "manic pixie dream woman"
user1: I don't see anything about a date in the documents 
user2: interesting*
user1: will do 
user2: do you ever watch musicals?
user1: I have seen a few and enjoyed them
user2: which are your favorites?
user1: Chicago. Mamma Mia 
user2: nice
user2: is fiddler on the roof a musical?
user1: It is 
user1: Is there anything more we need to discusses?
user2: ive probably only seen about 3 musicals: fiddler on the roof, the sound of music, and .... perhaps ive only seen 2...
user1: ohhh yes the sound of music
user1: a classic
user2: yes!
user1: Disney movies seem to be musicals as well
user1: always lots of singing in those
user2: the lion king!
user2: umm also the little mermaid is a good one
user1: Songs that they also play on the radio so you can never escape
user2: which one has "matchmaker matchmaker make me match?""
user1: Let it go
user2: that is so true
user2: oh yes, sadly
user2: lol
user1: Fiddler on the roof
user2: ooh
user1: Anything else we need to discuss?
user2: i think we are good

user2: nice to talk to you

conversation:
user2: This movie seems to give light to a love story while focusing on a genre of music that is lost.
user1: I mean sure, I wonder how realistic the show biz part of this movie was ?
user2: True. Was it more about the love story or true to the hardships of the industry
user1: For me it was more a love story - I mean the ending showing "what it could be if.."  showed that it was focusing more on the romantic part - I guess that's what people are looking for these days in a movie.
user2: People do look for the romance and positive outcome. But sometimes a movie is more memorable if they dare to focus outside that box. 
user1: Absolutely, but when You're making a movie like that - with dept I mean and second meaning, I sometimes think most of the audience is totally missing that. I mean I agree that Sebasian was kind of a snob and Mia's lacked of depth, but I strongly think it was intentional... there ARE snobs and no depth characters falling in love out there You know.
user2: Ha Ha yes that is true, keeping it true to real life. Even snobs fall in love. 
user1: Yes ;)  I personally think he was not THAT BIG of a snob, he was just passionate and HE WAS trying to reach out to her to show her and invite her to his world.
user2: But I guess that is the beauty of the characters and the movie. People identify enough to form opinions. That means the you were invested to a degree. Therefore the movie was successful at drawing in the audience. 
user1: As much as I agree with all that, I think Gosling's acting could be a little better. Especially when he is talking about Jazz how every performance is different - it spoiled a movie a little bit for me - detached I want to say - even tho I'm a great fan of the soundtrack and I share his passion to Jazz. 
user2: I think that is the line you walk in Hollywood. He was able to bring his fan base into the movie and gain a following right away. However, there were probably others that would have been better suited to take on the role with a different level of passion or know how
user1: Agree - but You can not deny that chemistry between him and Emma Stone - I mean how many movies did they do together ? They should marry already or something ;)  I like to think that chemistry is real and not just Emma's great acting "forcing" him to fall in love in her ;)
user2: They do have great chemistry together. I would imagine they have a true solid friendship outside the movies. Either that or like you said, they are great actors when it comes to pretending to have chemistry! 
user1: uhh... I could pretend ANYTHING wit Emma ;)
user1: *with
user2: I think overall the movie was a winner. We can pick it apart, but it was a success as far as telling the love story and adding the musical history. 
user1: Sure, I agree - and the main theme song ( You know, "city of start" or something like that ) really worked/helped me to get into the "mood" of the movie and go on that smooth trip mixing fairy tale romance with sometimes harsh reality of show biz in LA.
user1: *stars
user2: I agree. the music sets the mood for this movie so well. The soundtrack was a winner standing alone! 
user1: YES ! Couldn't agree more - but the dancing parts could be a little better :) I mean it looks like Ryan was just not trying - I know he wanted to look "cool" like he dance like he doesn't care, but to me it didn't look good ;)
user2: I wonder if that was his intention, to seem cool and smooth. Or was it lack of professional training prior to the movie. 
user1: this is exactly what I was thinking when I watched it - but in the end I came to the conclusion that it doesn't matter as it simply doesn't look good :) I mean viewer should not ask questions like that :)
user2: I agree he should of had more training. But I also think that viewers are really good at being critics. If he danced better, would we be talking about another point of the movie in a negative way?
user1: Well that's their job to NOT make points like that in the movie ;) They ( makers of the movie ) should not give us bullets to shoot at them ;) You know what I mean ?
user2: True statement. I guess that just shows that it was a good movie, not perfection. 
user1: That's exactly what it was - a really good movie, but I don't know if it deserved an Oscar ;) I'm not saying it didn't, I'm saying I'm not so sure if that would be my pick...
user2: I think the Oscar came from the musical/something different aspect. If it was up against other great musicals I am sure it would have not won. Still a good movie. And like we stated, a wonderful soundtrack. 
user1: Yes, but it's not one of those movies I would again ( or couple times ) - there are movies like that for me, but this one is not one of them ( but im not saying I didn't like it )
user2: The critics responses are interesting. A wide variety of opinions. Typically with an Oscar win, critics are pretty much in uniform
user1: Oh, I didn't know that - I thought movie was generally liked ;)

conversation:
user1: Hello. Have you watched any musicals before, like La La Land?
user2: No. Not my kind of genre.
user1: I get that. I didn't plan on watching it either, but I did and for the most part it was a pretty good movie.
user2: Are you reading a document? I'm not seeing anything here that I'm supposed to read.
user1: Yes, but I think you get something different if anything to read. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were in the movie.
user2: I heard it was a great movie. But it's a girlie movie, so i passed. I like action and suspense.
user1: I'm more into thrillers, suspense, who done it types, but for some reason this movie kept my attention. I think Ryan Gosling has been in many types of movies, do you think?
user2: Yeah. Did this movie have a happy ending?
user1: I really don't remember. It probably did in some way. There have been other musicals that didn't keep my attention the way this one did, but for the life of me, I can't remember how it ended.
user1: Ryan plays a jazz pianist and Emma as an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love. 
user2: Did they get married?
user1: Lol. no. Not all movies end up that way. My husband watched it with me for awhile and the jazz piano parts kept his interest.
user2: I like Emma. She's cute and has great style. What happened to her character in the movie? 
user1: I know they see each other and then if my memory is right, they split for awhile, each going after what dreams they had .
user1: Do  you like jazz at all? 
user2: I only like classic rock. Def Leppard, ZZ Top, etc
user1: Cool. Then you don't follow. I liked ZZ Top. Saw them at an outdoor concert in GA long ago.
user2: Music back then was so much better than the stuff nowadays. 
user1: I was looking through the notes and apparently they did split up in the movie and met again at a party some months later. 
user1: Yea, I'm still getting used to today's music but half the time I don't understand what they are saying.
user2: That's interesting. Fate intervened. What's meant to be will happen no matter what. Can't force romance. If it happens, it happens. Higher power at work.
user1: So the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 92 percent and IMDB ? gives it an 8.1/10, whatever that means
user2: That's high. Maybe I'll rent it.
user1: Like I tell my Significant other, broaden your horizens, huh? Lol.  I also don't recognize this director Damien Chazelle
user2: I don't recognize it either. But all those reviews can' be wrong. Maybe I'll look at some trailers on youtube.
user1: I don't know if you use Netflix also. We watch You Tube, Netflix, Redbox, depending on what we are interested in.
user2: I used to have Netflix on a free trial. I liked it, but wasted too much time watching lol. I would rather do some surveys to earn extra cash.
user1: Me too. I'm trying to read these documents to make sure I've got my side covered. It says movie made in 2016. Yea, I would look at YouTube trailers first before watching it.
user2: Did it win Oscar or Golden Globe or something?
user1: I don't think so, but wasn't there a mixup at the awards show where somebody read the wrong thing and said La La Land won, when they really didn't?
user2: Yeah, I remember something like that. Somebody was probably smoking something he shouldn't have. Such a serious announcement should be taken more seriously.
user1: The people who handled the envelope got fired I think.
user2: Good. Should lose their jobs. People need to know there will be consequences for screwing up. 
user2: Bye! Nice chatting with you.

conversation:
user2: hi 
user2: tell me about movie
user1: Hey..this is a musical drama romance
user2: Oh ok, how well do you tell me about this?
user2: What is this musical called?
user1: It's funny too. It's got a lot of fantasy in it. I like the music, a lot of jazz. It's shot in LA and it's really entertaining. 
user1: The name of the movie is called La La Land
user1: The cast is Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, John Legend, and Callie Hernandez
user1: Gosling stars as Sebastian and he acts as a snob, but he and Emma who plays as Mia, falls in love.
user1: Have you seen any movies with any of these cast before?
user1: If you like love stories, I would suggest you go see it. It actually gives great pointers for relationships.
user1: It's rates 8.6 out of 10 by Rotten Tomatoes, 93/100 by Metatcritics, and 8.1/10 my IMDB. So, I would say very good ratings and it's deserved. This is a very great movie.
user1: How interested are you in taking a look at this movie?
user1: HELLO, ARE YOU STILL THERE????
user1: You need to chat back in order to finish this conversation and complete the HIT...

user2: I think all in the film acted well. So that only It have got the oscar

user2: Thats nice to hear. I will surely watch this movie.
user2: what are the crucial part in the film?
user2: R u there?
user1: They met at a party and Mia tried to annoy him by requesting a song he disliked. However, that also sparked some chemistry between them. 
user1: Then the story began from there. :)
user1: They also tried to encourage each other to pursuit their dreams. 
user1: Hi
user1: You there?
user1: Apparently Sebastian didn't like his role in the band and Mia failed lots auditions as well. So sad. Good thing they had each other.

conversation:
user2: Hello there
user1: Hi
user1: Thats a high rating for rotten tomato
user2: What film is it?
user1: Oh its LA LA Land
user1: Made in 2016
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 92%
user1: Do you generally watch movies with good ratings?
user2: Not often, honestly they usually seem to be more boring to me than easily consumed films. How about you?

conversation:
user2: Did you know that La La Land was filmed in Cinemascope?
user1: Interesting, no I did not know that. Did you know that La La Land stars Emma Stone? I like her.
user2: I like her too - Ryan Gosling was a good actor in this as well.
user1: Yes, he sure was. There was a lot of showbiz and dancing, which was entertaining. 
user2: The movie got a little slow in the middle, but it picked up in the end
user1: I definitely agree, it seems a lot of people also agree that the two leads weren't that great at dancing, so maybe they thought it was a bit slow. 
user2: The music scene in Los Angeles was interesting to see in the movie however
user1: Definitely, I also liked that it's a fantasy and kind of like being in a place we might dream of.
user2: It was definitely a fantasy like the old style of Hollywood musicals.   
user1: For sure. It was directed by Damien Chazelle. I'm not sure if I've seen any of his other movies.
user2: I can understand why Sebastian would not want to play Christmas songs.  That would get old quickly.
user1: Haha, for sure. It seems his jazz improvisation really peeked the interest of Mia. 
user2: I can understand it.   She definitely was trying to tease him by requesting a song that he hated as well.
user1: Absolutely, I'm glad he went along with her and they connect and chat in the car.
user2: It is a classic love story in the musical part of LA
user1: Yeah, and they threw in some 1980's music, which was fun. 
user2: 80's music is always fun even if it is not the jazz that Sebastian loves
user1: Yeah, he really loves it. I really liked the part where Sebastian suggests that Mia write a one woman show. 
user2: Yes it was great that she wrote a play, but it was sad that Sebastian ended up playing in a band that he did not enjoy.
user1: Yeah, it is sad that he didn't enjoy it. But it did give him steady income, which helped financially after Mia and he moved in together. 
user2: RIght.  It was sad that he just did it because he knew Mia was getting pressure from her mother.  Mother-in-laws ya know?
user1: Haha, absolutely. And it made Mia upset to see him sad, so that's no good.
user2: I know.  But not following his dream was ultimately what led to their breakup
user1: Yeah, that was sad. Mia said she liked him more when he was unsuccessful, but following his dreams.
user2: But she followed her dream and had a horribly unsuccessful play.
user1: She did, and Sebastian misses the play. That was hard to watch. 
user2: It was very sad  and I hated the fact that she was unable to forgive him
user1: I know, me too. I wish she would have forgiven him. I can't believe she had to move back to Nevada. 
user2: I know - and going back to her Nevada and giving up on her dreams?  That was sad.
user1: Yeah, leaving her dreams and her love, kinda depressing.
user2: It was depressing.  But Nevada might be a less stressful place to live than LA

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hey
user1: so, what movie is it about?
user2: The movie I'm currently looking at is La La Land, and it's definitely something you should see
user1: yes.
user2: It succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard headed fable, but is still a romantic comedy
user1: Ryan Gosling for the win
user2: It's very genuine
user2: Agreed
user1: is he with emma stone?
user2: He is with Emma stone in a lot of the movie 
user2: They both are the main characters
user2: Emma Stone plays a character called Mia
user1: i see. Is there a lot of singing in the movie?
user2: There certainly is 
user2: Most of the movie could be portrayed as a musical 
user1: Romantic comedy?
user2: I would say so
user2: There's many scenes in which Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone sing together
user1: You think I can bring kids?
user2: Do you generally watch movies paying attention to good ratings?
user2: And yes you definitely can
user1: alright
user1: Lalaland has good ratings
user2: it certainly does
user1: I think they won oscars
user2: They did! A lot of them actually
user2: Do you typically like musical romantic comedies like la la land?
user1: is it a happy movie, no crying like The Notebook
user2: It's definitely happier than the Notebook, although there are some dramatic parts
user2: But I definitely didn't cry
user2: I liked most of the musical numbers in the movie though, which were mostly happy 
user1: no. I think it's cheesy. But I would try because they won Oscars
user2: Yeah I agree
user2: Its definitely a solid movie
user2: But I wasn't about all the hype
user2: It definitely is an important modern movie
user1: I prefer thriller and sci-fi

user1: Hi, I was reading
user2: Great. Let me know when you are finished 
user1: So what do you think this movie is (e.g., musical or romantic comedy)?
user2: I think it is a romantic musical with a bit of comedy included
user1: Yeah, I tend to agree... It's more about music...
user2: Yes. Signing and dancing of actors with some romance mixed in
user1: Does it seem plausible that traditional black music needs to be saved?
user1: Are you there?
user2: The movie does seem to promote the saving of old jazz music that isn't as popular now
user1: Yeah, that's probably a worthy endevor
user1: The choice of actors seem good
user2: They seem to include some great 80's songs as well
user1: Cool, the 80s seem to be making a comeback 
user2: The cast is very interesting. I didn't know John Legend acted. 
user1: I didn't know Gosling could dance
user2: Yes it's not something that I have seen in his previous work
user2: Although the reviews mention that the dancing wasn't the best
user1: I can see him at a jazz club
user2: Agreed 
user1: ...and being invited to play keyboards
user2: Sad to see some critic felt that Emma Stone's character lacked depth. 
user1: I can also see him trying to convince someone's mother that he is worthwhile.  Hee
user1: Maybe since she plays one of the millions trying to be a "star"
user2: Sadly it doesn't work out for her and she has to go back home
user1: I hate to keep harping of Gosling but I can see him missing the play...
user1: That is sad, sure it happens in real life a lot
user2: Yes and I can see her being so stubborn and refusing to forgive him
user1: Yep, that seems realistic
user2: It meant a lot to her. I understand why she was hurt
user1: Yes, that's kind of hard to forgive...
user1: Never heard of Boulder City, Nevada...
user2: me either
user2: must have been rough to go back to a small? place after living in a more exciting LA
user1: Some people don't take to LA well...  To me, it's nice to visit but you know the rest...
user2: The traffic would drive me crazy
user1: That and the smog...
user1: When are we supposed to finish the conversation?
user2: Yes. She is probably better off back in NV 
user1: It got pretty good ratings from IMDB...
user2: I think after we have made 12 comments 
user1: Not sure, I've only been to Vegas and that's also a nice to visit place but...
user1: OK, thanks... I'm checking out
user2: nice chatting 

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: hi
user1: Have you seen la la land?
user2: I haven't but I heard it was really good.
user2: Have you?
user1: Yes.
user1: I loved it. 
user1: I think most would and did considering the scores, 93% on metacritic, is very high.
user1: Rotten tomatoes score was 92%.
user1: are you there still?
user1: You are taking a very long time to respond at all.
user1: Are you doing a nother hit at the same time or something?
user2: I'm here! SOrry my computer froze.
user1: Well maybe there is some glitch and you got disconnected or you are busy somewhere else but i have waited 5 minutes.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: HI -- so, have you seen the movie La La Land? 
user1: I can't say that I have. What is it about?
user2: It's a musical set in LA.  It's a love story between a jazz pianist and an aspiring actress.  Do you like romantic comedies?
user1: I'd have to say I don't like romantic movies or musicals. This sounds like I would hate the movie overall. Does it have singing every few minutes like that movie HighSchool Musical?
user2: Ha, I know what you mean, I don't normally like romances or musicals either!  But the music works because it's part of the story.  It got amazing reviews -- even Rotten Tomatoes gave it 92%! 
user1: This is probably something I'd take the wife to see. Who is in the movie actor wise?
user2: It's got Ryan Gosling, who is terrific.  And also Emma Stone. John Legend is in it too, and he does a great job. 
user1: Well I like Emma Stone, always thought she was a good looker and the wife will enjoy Gosling. I assume they are the two main actors right?
user2: Yeah, they're the two main actors in it.  I bet you and your wife would both like it, it's a great date night movie.  
user1: In that case, I think I could stomach it since it's got, good actors. Who is the director? 
user2: The director is someone I've never actually heard of before this movie, a guy named Damien Chazelle.  Are you familiar with him?  I never heard of hm before this but I don't really know a lot of directors. 
user1: I've never heard of him either. He must of done a great job if the movie has so many positive reviews.
user1: What did you think of the overall movie? Did you find yourself falling asleep through it?
user2: Yeah, I'm sure his career has really taken off!  It must have been really challenging to direct this kind of movie.  
user2: As far as falling asleep...
user2: no, and I fall asleep through a lot of movies!  
user2: There are some funny scenes in it - Gosling and Stone have a few encounters where they get off on the wrong foot.
user1: Well, that is promising then. I assume there is at least some regular dialog instead of singing all the time right?
user2: Yes, it's definitely acting just as much as it is singing.  I couldn't take the movie if it were 100 percent singing -- that would be more like an opera, ha!  And that is definitely not for me!  You have to trust me on this!
user2: It's such a good story and gives a lot of insights about what it's like to make a go of a show business career in LA. 
user1: Is it modern day LA or a bit in the past? 
user2: That's what's weird, it's kind of hard to tell.  A bit in the past I think but it'd kind of not clear.  It could be any time, and that might be on purpose, because the same struggles these aspiring performers have in this movie have been dealt with for generations.  
user2: They have their "art" that they want to be true to, but at the same time, they have to do things to pay the bills, like play music they don't like, stiff like that.  
user2: stuff
user1: Ah ok, I only ask that because the name of the movie seems like something that came out of the 1950's or something.
user1: Now that I mention it does the title of the movie have anything to do with the movie?
user2: Yeah, I know, it's def a throwback title and all the ads and a lot of the clothes look like throwback clothes too.  
user2: Yes, the title of the movie works on a few levels.  Obviously first of all "LA" is a reference to Los Angeles...but also
user2: It's kind of a reference to not living in reality, living in a dream world...
user1: Wow as you said that it actually clicked in my mind "la la" LA, Los Angeles. 
user2: And also of course "la la" refers to music as well
user1: Clever titling, I like that. Just knowing that gave the movie a bit more character. How long is the movie?
user2: Yeah, I like that about the title too.  There are a lot of things like that that work on a few levels.  There's a lot more to it than it might appear on the surface.  As far as the length, I guess about 2 hours, I'd say.  It really flies by, there are these ups and downs and you get so caught up in the characters' struggles with show business.  At one point Emma Stone's character is in a play that is a disaster, and she decides to leave LA, just as Ryan Gosling's career starts to take off. 
user1: Wow, two hours of music and dance, this was pretty much made for my wife. How high did you say the reviews where?
user2: The reviews were awesome.  I always trust Rotten Tomatoes, and they gave it a 92.  Also Metacritics gave it a 93%.  And on IMDB, it got an 8.1 out of 10.  
user2: I hope you and your wife enjoy it as much as I did! 
user1: Those are pretty high scores. I hope I do too
user1: You taking off?
user2: Take care, I think that's it unless you have any other questions!
user1: Nope thats it for me, have a good night!
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello
user2: La la land huh
user2: what do you think
user1: I'm not too sure about this movie. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone but if it's another dance-music movie, I'm over them.
user2: lmao
user2: TOTALLY
user2: I didn't bother watching it
user2: I tried but, i wasn't connecting
user1: My husband just traveled to Los Angeles and keeps going on about how great it is. I am not a fan of that either
user2: Oh wow, that's a surprise.
user2: I thought everyone expect me liked it
user1: Have you been there?
user2: NO
user1: The reviews on this movie are very opposing
user2: Yeah I guess that why it made all those awards, because it's a showbiz story
user1: Who listens to Jazz anymore?
user2: lol, I dont know. It's so old
user2: I didnt knw john legend was in the movie
user2: Seriously I tried watching this movie, I couldn't get thorugh it
user1: The last time I heard a character named Sebastian was the Cruel Intentions movie
user1: I'm not much of a movie person but I thought this one might be good until I heard that it's got music and dancing. Just not my thing
user2: Lol that was Ryan Philipe 
user2: the ratings to this movie is really high though
user2: it's in the 90s
user1: Was it supposed to be a christmas movie? They mention christmas songs.
user2: no
user2: its like a showbiz struggle movie
user1: That might have made it better. ;)
user2: And then I has a romantic twist to it too
user1: It would be hard to be putting pressure on the person you are dating to find work if they are not happy with what they are doing.
user1: Seems like the classic, love, fight, chase each other around the world type of movie
user2: Do you watch movie of such high ratings or you vary
user1: I actually don't pay attention to ratings. I'll watch it if the previews get me interested.
user1: I don't even remember the previews for this one
user2: yeah me to
user2: What generes do you like
user2: genres 
user1: Usually drama and comedy. My husband forces me to watch sci-fi so I occasionally get sucked into those too.
user2: this is a muscial, you like muscial
user2: s
user1: No way. Musicals are the worst
user2: i notice I dont see musicals enough too. And the one I really like was probably high school musical
user2: lol
user1: I'm surprised they call this a comedy. I wonder what was so funny in it?
user1: I never saw High school musical. I do have to watch musical animations like Sing though. I have young kids.
user2: lol, I think Emma's character was kinda naive and snobbish so I think they played that part
user2: Anyway what a nice conversation, it was nice finally meeting someone who doesnt like la la land
user1: Nice talking to you about this movie too.

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: you there?
user2: Hi.  Do you want to watch La La Land?
user1: I do! I've seen it already but I'd be interested in watching it again
user2: It got a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Yeah, it was pretty suprisingly good, I think.
user1: You don't really see that kind of movie these days
user1: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were both very believable
user2: It stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.  Of course, some have called it a "fizzy fantasy".
user1: haha yes.
user1: I think that it might have been over-hyped a bit, but it was definitely enjoyable
user1: their romance felt fairly realistic to me.
user1: but I also agree with the critics who said that neither of them was particularly good at singing or dancing
user2: Well, a critic did say they lacked depth as characters.
user1: I agree with that 
user1: But it's funny 
user1: because I think, in a way that was the whole point of it.
user1: they were kind of blinded by the glamour of everything
user1: so it was just a shallow romantic fling that they had
user1: but they thought it was far deeper than it actually was.
user2: Yeah, I read that the title refers to music, Los Angeles, and to being out of touch with reality.
user1: Definitelhy
user1: like, they were kind of in "la la land".
user1: out of touch with that was actually happening
user1: did you see the it?
user2: There was the scene at the beginning where Sebastian is fired for disobedience.  And he storms out right past Mia.
user1: Yeah that was pretty childish.
user1: What'd you think of the music?
user2: I have seen it.  I am a big fan of musicals so was happy to see any still getting made, though I am not a fan of musicals that mostly revolve around musicians.
user1: haha
user1: I agree, it is a little too self-referencial
user1: I did like that they didn't make both of the characters actors though.
user1: It was more interesting that they were from different worlds, but both kind of wanted to be stars.
user2: I prefer when musicals just really do have musical bits thrown in to normal every day lives.
user1: I agree!
user1: What would you rate it out of 10? apparently it has an 8.1 on IMDB
user1: I think those ratings can be pretty good, because they're an average of what viewers rate the movie instead of critics
user2: Yeah, having scenes of people failing auditions...  Well, I guess it is set in Los Angeles.
user2: I usually use Rotten Tomatoes.  I'd probably rate it lower just because of the hype, like you said.
user1: gotcha.
user1: I think it was interesting though.
user1: Mia got to follow her dreams
user1: but then Ryan Gosling's character tried to find a steady job, with that Keith character, played by John Legend
user2: And Sebastian had to put up with playing in a jazz fusion band that he didn't really enjoy.
user1: I forgot that part
user1: but he accuses Mia of liking him more when he was struggling
user1: I think he might've been right
user2: And when he misses her play!  Bad move,Sebastian.
user1: that's a real rookie move.
user1: You gotta be supportive
user2: It is hard to be supportive when you have to support a disaster though.
user1: right. 
user2: Maybe Damien Chazelle will make another musical.  Or inspire others to.
user1: Yeah that was all definitely part of the middle part of the movie sagging a bit
user1: I think he might
user1: Music seems to be a pretty common theme for him in his movies, at least
user1: and that's probably why Sebastian was a Jazz snob. Damien Chazelle is a jazz musician himself
user2: I didn't know that.
user1: mhm, that's also why he made Whiplash before this.
user2: Maybe that's why he has Sebastian stick up jazz music in the movie.
user1: I think that's probably why
user2: I had heard about a movie about someone on a park bench... a jazz trumpet player or something... that Chazelle made before this.
user1: hm, I haven't heard of that one
user1: But I'd be curious to see more of his work.

user1: I'd like to know more about it. I may want to see it, sometime in the future. 
user1: Who are the main characters?
user2: Awesome! You definitely should watch it some time. It is set in LA and is basically a love story between a a jazz pianist (Ryan gosling) and a woman that wants to be an actress (Emma stone)
user1: How do the characters feel about one another? If they're in love, or falling in love, how does that come about?
user1: Or how do they meet, if that's a better question.

conversation:
user2: Hello, the movie I have is called La la Land, a 2016 Musical Drama and romance film. It has a Rotten Tomatoes Score of 92%  average rating 8.6
user2: Seems that is is about an aspiring actress that moves to LA and falls in love while pursuing her dreams.
user1: Sounds interesting. Is it based on a true story?
user2: Supposedly it is satirical about how we live our lives trying to catch our dreams. It does not appear to be a true story from the description that I have. 
user2: What do you think of the title? Sounds kind of like it's making fun of dreams right?
user1: Who are the actors?
user2: Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, John Legend, Callie Hermandez
user1: I love the title, like it is about a dreamer, which seems accurate from your description.!
user2: Indeed it does, does it sound like a film you'd be interested in? 
user1: Nice! I'm a fan of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. John Legend the singer? Great voice. Yes, it sounds like a movie I would enjoy!
user2: Some of the reviews seem a bit harsh, but overall they say good things about it. 
user1: Plus Rotten Tomatoes is pretty critical, so 92% is impressive!
user2: Looks like I got the next document
user1: What are the criticisms?
user1: Ok
user2: Would you like to know about the scenes?
user1: Is there a lot of natural outdoor scenery?
user2: Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvision despite warnings from the owner to stick to traditional music resulting in his being fired despite Mia being moved enough to come in. It doesn't appear to have a lot of outdoor scenery (only given 2 scenes). Mia 2 months later runs into him at a party. 
user2: Mia, the actress after many failed auditions decides to write a one woman play. 
user2: The two hook up moving in together (sebastian and Mia) 
user1: Are there a lot of dance scenes?
user2: It seems like there are dance scenes yes, but does not specifically state 
user1: Does it have a happy ending?
user2: I'm not sure, doesn't say, I'm going to wager it may as it is supposed to be romance
user1: Right, they may not want ti spoil it!
user1: *to*
user1: Seems like a high energy film.
user1: How long is it?
user2: Ok last scene updated. Mia and Sebstain get into an argument in the last tour, Mia has her play which ends poorly with nearly no one showing up (including Sebsatian since he was busy). It seems to not have a happy ending, she leaves to go back to Boulder Nevada unable to pay debts
user2: No length listed :(
user2: The film does seem to have a lot of energy and movement to it. 
user1: That's ok. Sometimes life doesn't have happy endings. I waa just curious.
user1:  That's ok!
user2: Do you typically watch movies with good scores?
user1: Yes!
user2: I've seen some poor indie ones that were pretty good, but overall the better the score the better the movie haha
user1: Is it modern music?
user2: Seems to be mostly focused on Jazz music. Do you like muscials? 
user2: musicals*
user1: Sure, I like all kings of movies.
user1: *kinds* lol
user2: Same, do you think you'll take a look at La la Land in the near future? 
user1: I'll definitely look into it! Thank you!
user2: No worries, I'm not sure where it goes from here, I haven't gotten anymore documents 
user2: Finish conversation? 
user2: Do you have anyother questions about the movie?
user1: Okay, maybe we can just finish the conversation and see what happens.  I can't think of any other questions right now.
user2: ok, thanks for participating with me
user1: Thank you! :) 

conversation:
user1: Have you seen La La Land?
user2: La La Land is a 2016 American musical romantic comedy-drama film written and directed byDamien Chazelle. It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist and Emma Stone as an aspiring actress,who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles while pursuing their dreams. The film's title referssimultaneously to music, the city of Los Angeles, and to the idiom for being out of touch withreality.
user1: Don't copy and paste, it's says in the instructions.  Emma Stone, who played Mia Dolan, do you think she is hot?

conversation:
user1: Hello! Have you seen LA LA LAND?
user2: No! What's it about?
user1: It's a romantic comedy musical starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone
user2: That sounds interesting. I love a good romantic comedy! Is it any good?
user1: They meet, dance and sing their way in and out of love 
user1: Highly recommended. 
user2: Ok. I will definitely have to look into that. It sounds like something the whole family can watch.
user2: I have kids so that is something I always have to consider.
user1: Maybe kids might not enjoy it. Depends. It's fairly safe for children, as I recall, but being at least a teenager would make it more accessible. 
user1: Gosling plays a jazz pianist who REALLY loves the music even though it isn't as popular as pop.
user1: Have your kids seen other musicals?
user2: Yes. They like them. They love music and movies so musicals are something they watch every chance they get.
user2: Who does Emma Stone play?
user1: There's a seen where Gosling is hired to play at a restaurant during Christmas and starts doing jazz. The boss hates it, warns him. Emma Stone enters, loves what he's doing -- just as Ryan is fired on the spot. She tries to talk to him on the way out, but he's mad and walks right by her.
user1: Emma plays Ryan's Girlfriend
user2: That's sad. So how do they end meeting again?
user2: Ok.
user1: Months later, at a party. Gosling's in a band that covers '80s pop, which he hates. That's when they start to connect, sing that song, "A Lovely Night."
user2: That's great for them! It stinks that he has do something he hates.
user1: Later, after her auditions tank, Gosling talks Emma into writing her own play
user2: Does the play work out? 
user1: Well, first they move in together. He gets a regular gig in a band playing fusion. He takes the job because he knows her mother is concerned about his employability. The band does well, but when she watches them perform she realizes he's not enjoying playing that kind of music
user2: So what does she do then?
user1: Metacritics gave it a 93 rating.
user2: That's really good.
user1: Yes, but Mia's (Stone) play tanks and Sebastian (Gossling) doesn't attend because he's mad at her for telling him he's abandoning his dreams when all he was trying to do is make her happy. 
user2: Oh man. Do they stay together?
user1: Sebastian tries to apologize for not coming to her play, but she won't forgive him. She's unable to pay the theater because her play didn't sell enough tickets, so she moves back home to Boulder City in Nevada. 
user2: That's a bummer! Do they make up?
user1: Well, it's never that easy.
user2: To true. So how do they end up getting back together?
user1: I'm not sure if I should give away the ending, but the last scene was a real tear-jerker. 
user2: That's fine. Gives me an even bigger reason to watch it. Thanks for telling me about La La Land!
user1: Especially if you've lived through something like that -- being too young, crazy in love -- then communication glitches
user1: Yes, I think you'll enjoy it!
user2: Weren't we all?
user1: Sadly so if we're old enough.

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user1: You should really see the movie La la land if you haven't already.
user2: who plays in it?
user1: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play in it and they are very good actors.
user1: John Legend and Callie Hernandez also play in the movie.
user1: It is a musical, drama and romance. I personally do not like musicals but this is a fantastic movie.
user2: Wow  Emma Stone is one of my favorites
user2: Is there any comedy in it
user1: It is considered a romantic comedy by some critics so it does have some comedy.
user1: It also has a lot of melodrama and seriousness as well, so there is a good range of emotions throughout the movie.
user2: I will have to rent it  do you know what the critics have said about it
user1: They say it is a masterpiece. 
user2: Would it be appropriate for a teenager to watch 
user1: it is seriously pleasurable entertainment
user1: hmm...I think it would be appropriate for a teenager. It is a love movie though.
user1: It has a lot to do with music, especially Jazz. I am not sure if teenagers like Jazz much.
user1: It was give 92% by rotten tomatoes and 8.6/10 average.
user2: She likes those romance type movies but I just need to be careful of what she see's   She also loves jazz 
user2: I think I will defiantly need to rent it if it is not still in theaters. 
user2: Do you happen to know if it is still in movie theaters? 
user1: A major scene in the movie is when Sebastian ( Gosling) is playing jazz even though the owner warns him not to. Mia (Stone) comes in and loves it. She tries to compliment him but he rushes out very rudely. They meet months later.
user1: it was in theaters in 2016 so it probably isn't out still
user1: When they meet again she teases him and requests an 80's pop song which is offensive because he is such a good jazz artist. They hit it off afterwards though.
user2: I think we will try to find it on hulu or Netflix and see if we can stream it.         
user2: Does it take place outside of the US 
user1: I think it takes place in the US. Mia is trying to become an actress while Gosling is trying to become a jazz artist.
user1: They have  a hard time getting their careers started
user2: So they both are struggling to become better in both their career?
user2: So once they get their careers started is that when they start their romance
user1: Yes. This is a major theme in the movie. Mia has many failed auditions in the beginning. Sebastian suggests she try a one woman play.
user1: Their romance starts while they are trying to get their careers started.
user2: So does his suggestion help her career take off. 
user1: As you can assume, this is tough to do and they get into some arguments along the way.
user1: He misses her play which is very tough on them.
user2: So they are basically like an everyday ordinary couple experiencing bumps in the road.
user1: It really was a disaster of a play. Yes they are. However this play is a huge set back for them and they break it off after it fails and he doesn't show.
user1: Mia moves back to Nevada.
user2: And after she moves how do they meet up again? 
user1: I think you will have to watch the movie for yourself to find out the ending. I've told you a lot and don
user1: don't want to ruin the whole thing!
user1: trust me it is a great movie
user2: Thanks for all your help

user2: I CAN SEE THIS MOVIE 4 TIME
user2: THIS AMERICAN MUSICAL ROMANTIC MOVIE
user2: FAST REPLY ME\
user2: HELLO
user2: HELLOW
user1: you took long
user1: first

conversation:
user2: So how much did you enjoy the movie?
user1: I enjoyed the movie but not much into musicals.As far this genre of movie goes I guess it was better than average.
user2: Yeah, i like musicals but jazz isn't one of my favorite genres. But overall i liked the story and the actors.
user1: I agree the story was interesting and the acting was good.Did you like any of the musical scores?
user2: Yeah they were fine, like i said jazz isnt my favorite but it depends on what kind of jazz, i really love Ella Fitzgeralds music. The jazz in this movie wasnt supper jazzy so it was fine but i do prefer more pop or melodramatic musicals, what about you?
user1: I thought the story kind of lost interest in the middle.Did you find this to be true? I agree with the idea of a more melodramatic plot.
user2: There definitely were parts where the plot and characters seemed a little dull and  sort of lost interest, but that happens in almost every movie. Overall i think its a fine movie but i dont really get why critics rated it so high i just dont see it as that amazing.
user1: What did you think about the acting? Do you think the characters were true to life?
user2: For the most part the acting was good, some of the writing was a bit dull tohugh, as far as true to life i found it kind of odd that this middle aged white guy was the one saving jazz which is a traditionally African american genre, what did you think about that?
user1: I agree that the ratings seemed a little high for this movie.I dont pay much attention to ratings anyways do you?
user1: I agree jazz was founded by the black culture of the day and probably was influenced very little by white society.
user2: No not usually as long as i like a movie critics opinions dont matter. So what did you thing of the scene where Sebatian was fired for singing jazz instead of Christmas and then met up with Mia again months later, i tohught it was  kind of cute but also pretty typical of a movie like this.
user1: I thought the scene added a little bit of a twist and some dramatic appeal.
user1: I agree the scene was typical of this sort of movie.
user2: Yeah i liked it was well it just seemed a little stale like how the prince saw cinderalla at the ball and the found her and this was like mia was the prince and she found sebastian, i just wish movies like this could think outside the box a little more.
user1: I agree with the Cinderella comparison.I see a lot of reoccurring themes in movies.Do you notice a repeat of ideas across many different movies?
user2: Yeah defintiley, i think that at this point there have been so many films that explore so many different themes that it is rare to find a film that feels truly unique. Everything in some way takes from something else but im generally ok with that as long is done in an entertainng way.
user1: I agree but would still like to see some original ideas on screen.
user1: Do you think this film will become to be regarded as a great success?
user2: Yes truly unique fims are usally the most enjoyable, and i od think it will be considered a success.  How did you feel about the whole scene where Sebastian joins the band even though he doesn't like their music, i feel most people would do the same because they need the money but it is sad when people can't do what they are truly passionate about.
user1: I agree with you about the scene Im sure it was hard for the musician to put aside his passion and compromise his talent because of financial hardships.
user2: Yeah at least he was still getting to play music though, better than having to get an office job that he would hate even more but still i o see how his character would feel defeated over that, and how Mia would feel for him seing him not being happy.
user1: I agree at least he was able to work in his field.I think this scene leads us to examine our own priorities to an extent.Maybe that was its purpose.I often find hidden meanings in movies.Do you?
user2: Yeah i think most people can find things in movies that can be applied to themselves in one way or another. I usually find myself looking for these hidden meaning more often if im watching a movie for a second or third time, how about you?
user1: Yes I often get meaning that I overlooked the first time in a second viewing.Did this movie have any special meaning for you?
user2: Nothing to special just a shared love for music, albeit different genres. How did you feel about the scene where Sebastian missed Mias play so she left him and moved back home. I found it to be sad but yet again this is also something that happens in most romantic movies so i saw it coming.
user1: I thought is was sad also but like you said typical romantic plot.Do you know if this movie was based on any real life people or just the jazz community in general.
user2: As far as i know it wasnt based on anything real just the general struggle of people in the acting and music industries.
user2: Thinking aobut it overall how did you feel about the movie, how would you rate it , would you recommend it?
user1: There have been many movie themes that touch on the struggles of those in the entertainment industry.It must a tough world for performers.
user1: I would recommend it to certain groups of people I know.I enjoyed parts of the movie

conversation:
user1: I have a hard time with wanting to watch a musical. A lot of times, anymore, they don't come out that great.
user2: I don't like the musicals they make these days.  The stories in the older musicals are much better.
user1: I agree. This one seems like it is even worse. They talk about how it drags in the middle and the singing by both actors is not that great.
user2: I agree.  I wasn't even too crazy about the music.
user1: I do like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone though. I would be willing to try to watch it just because I like them as actors but I don't know if I would make it all the way through the movie.
user2: Hailed as the years most pleasurable entertainment.  That kills me.  It's all subjective based on what you like.
user1: I agree. I can't tell you how many times I have seen a rating on a movie and thought "What movie were they watching?" haha!
user2: I agree.  I also agree I like the actors in the movie.
user1: I would just be curious to see if it is really as bad as the critics make it out to be or if they just didn't like this particular movie idea. I don't really understand what they are saying when they say Sebastian is a jazz snob. What is that?
user2: I think it means he is snobby about the kind of jazz he likes.  Like a person is snobby about the kind of designer clothes they wear.
user1: I see. I like the fact that they are both doing what they love in the movie and in turn fall in love with each other because of following their dreams.
user2: I agree, I don't know why people resist love so much though.  They have such animosity for a while when they are so clearly attracted to each other.
user1: Right?! I also find it admirable that they are trying to make a movie based on loving Jazz. To be honest that is one type of music I just can't get into.
user2: No I love jazz but only instrumental.  I enjoy trying to determine the instruments used in the music.  I find it very relaxing.  Like Kenny G playing the saxophone.
user1: More power to you. I grew up loving music but never got into Jazz. I agree with your earlier statement about how it is hard to understand why people resist love so much. Maybe just bad experiences with it?
user2: I also find it amusing how people find fault with others for things they themselves have issues that should be resolved.
user1: Agreed. I hate how in the movie he has to somewhat give into what he doesn't really like just to be able to make things work. It is definitely more like what the real world is like.
user2: Happiness will never be achieved unless there is compromise.  However when it comes to compromising your true feelings instead of lettering your significant other really know how you feel then you will never achieve happiness either.
user1: Couldn't have said it better myself. It is hard to not want to hide your true feelings from the one you love, especially if you are worried about disappointing them in some way.
user2: He chose to play in the band to prove to her and her mother that he was someone.
user1: Right but he didn't really want to play in that band. He hid his true feelings to make her and her mother happy.
user2: If she really loves him she would not want him to do that.  If they don't communicate then this is where they end up, miserable.
user2: All of the things happening in this scene are simply caused from lack of communication about what each person wants.
user1: Yes, you can definitely see where there relationship starts to fall apart. It is when they start being dishonest with each other and covering up  their true feelings in order to appease the other.
user1: Lack of communication is the main reason I feel like most relationships don't work
user2: When you are a couple decisions should be made based on what is best for the couple.  Each side explains how they truly feel and they come to a consensus.
user2: The problem is no one is honest about their feelings.  Sometimes on purpose, sometimes because they don't even know how they truly feel.
user1: I agree but sometimes, in all honesty, life can get in the way. Lack of communication is a problem but sometimes it is not intentional.
user2: That is true and human nature for some reason demands that a person think the worst instead of interpreting things in the positive.
user1: Yeah, not sure what that is all about. I wonder if it is some type of survival instinct?
user2: Yea you are probably right about that.  It is hard to be vulnerable.
user1: That is definitely true. I think that is one of the main points in this movie. Even though the main characters are living together, it is still hard for them to be completely vulnerable with each other.
user2: I agree. I don't know why it is so hard just to say what you think and feel.  If a person truly loves you they will take the good with the bad.
user1: I feel the same way. It is hard to find that though.
user2: I believe we have met the terms of the task.
user1: I think so too. Do we just press finish conversation?
user2: Let's give it a try.

conversation:
user1: Hi! You should totally see La La Land. It's a romantic comedy, but it's got a lot of good music, is set it LA, etc.
user2: Hey there! Cool, what is it about?
user1: It's about a ajzz pianist (Ryan Gosling) and an aspiring actress (Emmas Stone) who meet and fall in love in LA. Trying to save jazz and what not. It got great reviews!
user2: That sounds fun. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Is the movie in theaters or is it out now?
user1: No, it's a 2016 movie.
user2: Cool. Do you know if it's on Netflix or any other streaming services?
user1: I don't, but my guess would be yes. Of course, there are some who pan it, but it got 92% on Rotton Tomatoes, FWIW.
user2: Well I'll have to check it out. 92% on Rotten Tomatoes is pretty good!
user1: I agree. IMDB was a bit less favorable at 8.1, but Metacritics is in line with RT at 93%/
user2: Very nice. I don't know tons about movies and ratings, but I feel like 8.1 on IMDB is pretty good still. Are there any other notable actors or actresses in it? 
user1: Yes - John Legend and Callie Hernandez. It's got some nice jazz improvisation -- you know, the artist is warned to stick to the traditional music, but he improvises instead. You know how it goes, but it's still really fun. 
user2: That makes sense that John Legend is in it. He's an incredible singer. I've never been a huge jazz fan but I think that jazz has a lot of mystery about it, and this movie seems to revolve around that a bit. You said it's a romantic comedy right? So how much jazz is there actually in it, pretty limited? 
user1: I think they might realize that their audience isn't going to be a bunch of jazz heads, so Sebastian (the one who wants to save Jazz, played by Gosling) is playing a 1980s pop band cover, so there's still some variety. 
user2: I see. Is it set in present day then?
user1: Well, it's at least post-80s... :)
user2: Close enough then, makes sense with the pop cover band in the 80s like you said haha. I missed that part 
user1: There's a pretty good variety of music. For example, Sebastian performs at a jazz club, but joins a jazz fusion band and is dismayed by their pop sound, so you can see it's not completely jazz-jazzy.
user2: Yeah for sure. So does the story mostly revolve around music then or does it pay a lot of attention to Emma Stone's role as an actress too?
user1: It pays a lot of attention to her as well. She's an aspiring actress -- Sebastian suggests she write a one-woman play. So she has he own thing going as well as her relationship with Sebastian and her concern for his career ambitions and her wish for him to be able to have an income but also enjoy what he is playing.
user2: Nice, that sounds pretty interesting. I bet it's an interesting dynamic to portray both a young actor and actress and how they have to prioritize their relationships and careers and what not. 
user1: Yes. And John Legend is the one who has the jazz fusion band. He's Gosling's former classmate.
user2: So he recruits Gosling to join his band once Gosling is in a rough patch or something? Why does he go for it instead of sticking with true jazz?
user1: Ah, indeed. Sebastian overhears Mia (Stone) trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career, so he finds success with this band, but doesn't like it, which upsets Mia. During their first tour, they get into an argument over your very statement - abandoning his dreams.
user2: So does he stick it out with the band or quit the band? 
user1: That is left unresolved, but he and Mia break up in the end, because he misses her play -- a disaster (the play) -- due to a band photo shoot. He tries to apologize, but she gives him the bird and moves back home.
user2: Well damn. So it's not your typical romantic comedy with a happy ending then.
user1: Well, you can't win 'em all. It's more of a romantic comedy-drama. Yeah. She's all despondent at the end and goes home to Boulder City, Nevada.
user2: That's good though, I think it's good for movies to have a dose of reality in them sometimes rather than everything just being so perfect. I think I'd enjoy it
user2: Thanks for the summary, I really appreciate it!
user1: My pleasure!

conversation:
user1: What would you like to talk it 
user2: Hello! So La La land got some great reviews on rotton tomatoes!
user2: Do you like musicals?
user1: not really do you ?
user2: Since la la land got such great reviews I've been thinking about checking it out.
user2: I'm also a huge fan of ryan gosling, how about you/?
user1: no because my wife is ga ga over him
user1: I heard the ove was poor 

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hello
user2: Now we are going to chat about la la land?
user2: Director Damien Chazelle done his job well
user2: Hey dude are you there?
user2: The movie got best place in IMDB
user2: In my point of view its a best romance film 
user2: We can watch the movie more than 5 times

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: Do you like musicals?
user2: sometimes
user1: La La Land is a great musical
user2: really? I haven't seen it. what is it about?
user1: It is a romantic comedy drama style movie
user2: who is in it?
user1: Ryan Gosling plays the lead role, it also stars Emma Stone
user2: I really like both of them. Is it a good story?
user1: The story is good it about a jazz pianist and an aspiring actress
user2: So the two of them have a romance?
user1: Yes it a they met lost touch and run back into each other type thing
user2: Like after them become famous they run into each other again and fall in love, right?
user1: no not so much, they both lose their jobs and she runs into him at a party where  he is playing 80's cover tunes
user2: Okay, that's different. I imagine a Jazz pianist playing 80's music. :) So you would recommend it?
user1: yes it has a lot of other stars as well, it is interesting, funny, and romantic
user2: So, it would be a good date movie?
user1: Definitely, at least for the lady..lol...
user2: yeah, but that's important. So nothing really good for a guy?
user1: Well  some guys like these kinds of movies. It also stars John Legend. Something for both I say
user2: Yeah, the music is probably pretty good?
user1: Yes since it is a musical, drama, romance, I think everyone could find something good in it. Do you know what year it came out?
user2: No, what year was it?
user1: 2016 so it is still fairly new, a great video night movie
user2: Well, your information has been really helpful.
user1: Oh and great dance numbers too if you like that
user2: I might rent it for Valentine's Day
user1: That would be perfect!!!
user2: Thanks for sharing

conversation:
user1: Hi.  I'm going to read this and be back.
user2: Hello. I am reading it too (:
user1: Okay done.  We are reading the same description, right?  About La la Land?  Musicals are my least favorite type of film so I can not say that I am excited about it.
user2: Yes we are. I see. Most of the reviews are positive but there are two negative reviews. Do you think this movie is different from ordinary musicals though, given all the themes the movie touches on?
user1: Although it does not sound like your standard musical since it is trying to be an "idiom for being out of touch with reality."  So that makes it a little more interesting.  Still though when people break into song in a movie I want to turn it off.  Oh just saw what you wrote.  Yes it sounds a bit different.  Would you want to see this based on the description?
user2: It does seem a little cheesy and I am a little put off by the comment that "Sebastian is a jazz snob and Mia's character lacks depth." However, since it appears to be different from  other movies and since I generally like Emma Stone as an actress, I may check it out.
user1: Emma Stone's character being described as lacking depth is another big turn-off for me.  Too man one dimensional female characters in Hollywood films for my taste.  I agree she is a good actress.  It is does slow up in the middle, like the one review said, I definitely could see myself getting bored with it.  What else has Emma Stone been in that you enjoyed?
user2: I forgot the name of the first movie she came out with, something about "A", a high school girl. I thought she was hilarious.
user1: I saw that.  Agreed!  
user1: I am not familiar with the director, Damien Chazelle.  Have you heard of them?
user2: I have not. I actually rarely pay attention to director names so I wouldn't recognize his name anyway. What do you think about how this movie discusses the "bittersweet happiness of treasuring things that are vanishing" in LA? Do you like the social commentary?
user1: Yes I like social commentary very much.  If it is just one note, fluff it doesn't interest me as much.  How about you?  I always forget, with the Rotten Tomatoes score is higher better or worse?  
user2: I'm not sure about the Rotten Tomatoes score. I agree with you on fluff. Okay so in the "Key Scene 1" box Sebastian is definitely coming across as a snob as he refers to Mia's song request as "an insult for 'a serious musician'." I feel like he thinks he's above her and everyone else.
user1: Yeah I could see that.  
user1: How many scenes are they giving us?
user2: I am curious as to what the quality of the song numbers are. Without the plot, I feel as though the songs may be good based on the detailed descriptions here. I think they're giving us 3-5 scenes.
user1: I do not know what "black musical genre" is, mentioned in the reviews.  Do you have any idea?
user2: Hmmm that seems kind of politically incorrect. I'm assuming jazz and blues perhaps? I think it's ironic that a Caucasian male is the "seemingly only person who can accomplish such a goal" of saving the "black musical genre from extinction". 
user2: The plot is getting a little more interesting. Sebastian seems like a cynic but his character is developing here as he takes this job for Mia despite the fact that he dislikes it. I am starting to like his character more.
user1: I feel like this is made by people in the business for people in the movie or music business, neither which I have any interest in.
user2: Yes it definitely does seem like an art project / someone's creative expression.
user1: Do you think they end up together in the end?
user2: I enjoy the fact that it is innovative. It may not be amazing but it's opened doors for development on a new artistic subgenre. Of course, I'm no expert to comment on that, it's just my understanding of it.
user2: I think they probably do.
user1: I can appreciate that.  
user1: Ah twist in scene 3.  Well I guess you have to have them fall apart so they eventually get back together on new terms.  Are there any other romance comedies that you enjoy?
user2: Haha that's a good way to look at it. I'm not a huge fan of romance comedies because they're somewhat demeaning to women sometimes and very basic and predictable. However, I like romantic comedies that are extremely hilarious with actors who are know to be very hilarious though.
user2: How about you?
user2: known**
user1: Maybe some from the 80's out of nostalgia.  Yes agreed women are usually used as a prop.  Actually something I can not stand is when the characters fall in love because they are supposed to, but you can't actually see any value in either character or why they would even have a connection.  Sometimes it seems writers are just going through the motions.  But I guess thats why it is a business.
user2: That's a great insight into how the business works. I feel like scene 3 is dramatic in a way that you would see in a school play or a teen movie / disney movie. It doesn't represent real life relationship drama as well as something like Silver Linings Playbook.
user2: However there are still some interesting points they're touching on that could be applicable to many relationships. It's just cheesy with the whole band thing.
user1: Haha agreed!  Yes band thing definitely makes it cheesy.  
user1: I've never heard of John Legend of Callie Hernandez.  Have you?
user1: *of Callie
user1: Shoot I meant Or.
user2: Yes John Legend is actually quite a unique artist in my opinion. You may have heard some of his songs at events / on the radio. He's an African American pianist with a unique voice. His music moves me and it's classical but modern at the same time.
user2: He's married to the model Chrissy Teigen, not sure if you follow that kind of stuff haha.
user2: I think he's won Grammy's.
user2: LOL I really like him.
user1: Awesome!  Sounds cool.  I don't keep up with that stuff but I have heard her name before.  SO maybe the music in the movie is decent?
user2: Yes I have full confidence in John (: I still think it's super weird that Ryan Gosling is the one "saving" African American music though. Maybe it's portrayed that way because he's in a position of power / privilege to do so and has a platform people will listen to more?
user1: Yeah that's always the way.  Like with Orange is the New Black.  If all of the actors were People of Color dumb ass Americans would not have given it the time of day.  I'm white by the way, I just know racism is everywhere.
user2: I haven't seen Orange is the New Black (I really need to get on that) but I kind of know of the context because I studied it in a Feminism class. I think you're right. 
user1: I'm going to have to research this after because I really hope that is not the theme they are going for in this movie.  But I wouldn't be socked if it were.
user2: Haha I think I may just end up watching this movie after. I'm curious.
user2: I'm also making a lot of assumptions and I could be totally off hahah. Although I think we're making pretty solid insights.
user1: Sure.  I think we are done!  Take care!
user2: Yay. You too!
user1: Thanks!

conversation:
user2: Hello?
user2: Are you there?
user1: Yes I am here.
user1: I like the movie. I'm interested in jazz and I appreciate the main character following his passion.
user2: Great thank you
user2: How did you feel about the acting?
user2: Did you enjoy the singing and choreography in the movie?
user1: I thought it was decent acting, although the actors were perhaps not that talented singers or dancers.
user1: I did enjoy the singing and choreography, and the actors did their best given the fact that they are not professionally trained as singers or dancers.
user2: Did you think Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had good chemistry as co-stars?
user1: Yes, they work well together.
user2: Do you think this movie was deserving of the accolades and hype it received?
user1: Do you agree that the middle of the movie "sags badly"?
user1: I think it is mostly deserving of the praise it received.
user2: I feel like it was a bit too long for me, and for a romantic comedy... but overall I agree that it was enjoyable to watch
user2: It was a great date night movie, and my wife loved it
user1: Did you think John Legend did a good job of acting, considering he is more known as a musician?
user2: I thought he was okay.. I agree that the 3 of them (Gosling, Stone, Legend) were all stretched
user2: John Legend with acting, and the other two with musical performing
user2: I do like him though
user1: Did you find the characters likable?
user2: I did, it was different than most movies I usually watch 
user1: How was it different?
user2: I thought it was a nice change of pace with a lot of the other heavy Oscar contending movies
user1: What did you find unique?
user2: I liked how the movie looked, and the feel of Los Angeles as the setting
user1: Do you think any other setting would have suited the movie?
user2: I feel like the homage to Hollywood and California was a big part of it
user2: Maybe Paris?
user2: It reminded me a bit of The Artist, which I really enjoyed a few years back.  It was charming
user2: How do you feel about the ending?
user1: I think it could have worked in another city with an art scene, but I agree that LA is an appropriate setting given Mia's struggles to make it as an actress.
user1: On one had it was sad that Mia and Sebastian did not end up together, but the ending made the movie more interesting and memorable.
user2: And maybe more believable?
user2: In terms of how many people come to be stars and it doesn't work out
user2: And the strain it can put on a relationship when one person becomes more successful than the other
user1: Yes differences in success can put a strain on relationships, when the dynamic changes.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi, how are you? Seen any good movies lately?

user1: but there's a great scene with Ryan playing piano
user2: So, are they love interests? 
user1: yup
user1: it has a pretty high imdb rating
user2: Nice, they did a good job together in another movie (I cant remember the name).  What happens in the movie?
user1: it's also got John Legend in it.
user2: I didnt know John Legend did acting
user1: I know
user1: it's basically about what happens to the two leads
user1: but the critics love the movie
user2: Im hesitant about musicals.  Is there anything that would sell me on the movie?
user1: isn't Ryan Gosling enough?
user1: Ryan Gosling. singing.
user2: HAHA! fo sho
user2: I dont know that I can see him singing.  Emma yes, idk about him.  DOes he have a good voice?
user1: Damian Chazelle directed. Never heard of that person.
user2: I havent either
user1: He does okay.
user2: So, does it end good? I hate a bad ending
user1: haven't seen a jazz-based movie in a minute. so that's cool.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hey! Are you interested in musicals or romantic comedies? I have been reading about a movie that combines both with a bit of drama 
user1: romantic comedies
user1: whats the movie about
user2: La La Land came out in 2016 and features Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. 
user2: It has a rotten tomato score of 92% and is about a jazz pianist and aspiring actress.
user1: whats the story line
user1: who directed it
user2: The two characters are pursuing their dreams. The title plays on both its setting and the idea of chasing dreams. Damien Chazelle directed it. 
user1: how long is the movie ?
user2: Critics seem to love the movie, though some have their doubts due to the underplayed dance and musical numbers, some say it is a little dull.
user2: The movie's romantic comedic elements are portrayed in one scene, where the two characters meet- played by Gosling and Stone. She seems him play piano and is impressed, but he is fired and brushes her compliments off. 
user1: is it on net flix ?
user2: I am not sure on that one, but it features songs like "I Ran (So Far Away)" and "A Lovely Night".

user1: where was the location  where the movie was filmed?
user2: The movie is filmed in Los Angeles, CA. and the title is a play on that location.
user1: does red box have the movie ?
user2: You could check online, but, another key scene for the movie involves jazz music. Sebastian, played by Goslings joins a band in an attempt to make a career for Mia (played by stone) and save the dying genre of jazz music. The band he joins plays jazz fusion.
user1: what other songs are in the sound track ?
user2: "Summer Montage" is another song played by Gosling as he works towards a jazz career. 
user2: "Start a Fire" is played by the band he joins.

user2: The movie is described as bittersweet. Having both loving moments and very true to life heartbreak. 
user1: what did you think of the cast ?
user2: John Legend is in the movie, as well as Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, and Callie Hernandez. Some critics felt the singing and dancing from the cast was a bit lack luster. 
user1: how much did it cost to make the movie?
user2: That is something you would have to research online for. The movie was made in 2016 and was shot in CinemaScope.
user1: who wrote the film?
user2: The film was written and directed by Damien Chazelle.
user1: was it funny?
user2: You should see La La Land and decide for yourself if the movie was great or lack luster compared to other romantic comedy/ musicals!

user2: Well thank you for the information! I look forward to seeing it
user1: THANK YOU 

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello there. How are you? I was just reading about the movie La La Land. Have you seen it?
user1: No, what is it about?
user1: I would love to watch it, may I have more information about it?
user2: If you are into musicals, it is a really classical approach to a new age musical. It stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as two people trying to find their way in Los Angeles.
user1: I love musicals! Especially modern musicals, I am definitely interested in watching it because I love Ryan Gosling. He has a great voice.
user2: Ryan Gosling is a struggling jazz musician and Emma Stone is an aspiring actress. They meet along the way and develop a relationship of sorts. As the movie progresses, you see the main characters go through times of joy and times of struggle.
user2: Yeah, Ryan Gosling sort of disappeared for a little while and then as of late he has been in a lot of movies.
user1: Great, with a touch of romance too. I am definitely interested in watching this. Is this a recent movie or has it been out for a few years?
user2: I've seen this movie and honestly, I think it was definitely worth watching. It gives quite the perspective on the struggle in Hollywood. It came out in late 2016.
user1: Okay. I have a high interest in the Hollywood life to and what really goes on behind the scenes of Hollywood. I know it isn't always what it seems. I will definitely watch this. I can't believe I haven't heard of it. 
user1: Do you have a favorite character in the movie? 
user2: I like Ryan Gosling's character personally. 
user1: After watching it, does it make you look at Hollywood in a different perspective?
user2: So, Ryan Gosling plays the character Sebatian and Emma Stone plays the character Mia. Mia first sees Sebatian when he is playing Christmas songs at the club he works at. This is how the movie starts, but they don't really meet that night because Sebatian is so caught up within himself at the beginning of the movie, that he practically runs Mia over on the way out of the night club.
user2: I'm gonna try not to spoil anything for you, this is in the description of the movie.
user2: When they finally meet at a house party, they have quite the night and that night spans into the scenery of the Hollywood hills. All of this whilst they sing and dance throughout the night it seemed.
user1: Okay, sounds interesting. Were they living two different lifestyles? & were  they in school?
user2: So, anyway, it really gives you quite the insight into Hollywood. I felt as though I had a better understanding of the hustle and bustle of Hollywood.
user1: Okay, I see. What Hollywood careers were they seeking? Like singing acting?
user1: What was the plot of the movie?
user2: Yes, they were living two entirely different lives, separate from each other. When watching the movie, it is like watching two separate stories. Sebastian is living out his life as they both collaborate on a project together. Mia, on the other hand, is working on the collaboration nonstop. In the meantime, they both are falling in love with each other, but it doesn't seem like they really want to commit to each other. 
user2: They weren't in school
user2: Sebatian is trying to get out of the club and start his own band. So, he is gone a lot.
user2: Mia, has a lot of personal issues, so she almost seems sort of lazy.
user2: When it comes to her career that is.
user1: Interesting, was there anything in particular that stood out to you?
user1: & any characters that you disliked?
user2: I sort of didn't like Mia's character in a way. She seemed like she was conflicted, and I don't want to say much more about her so I don't spoil anything.
user2: I love Emma Stone as an actress, but the character was a bit shallow. 
user2: I just know that Mia was more of the type of character to lean on someone like Sebatian, and when he wasn't around, she didn't push herself. Like, she gave up when people weren't looking.
user1: Okay, yes, she is a great actress. It can be kind of difficult at first adjusting to an actor/actress that you like character when they are the complete opposite than what you are used to seeing.
user1: Hmm, I wonder if it could have been because of problems she was dealing with at home although that is no excuse at all.
user2: Don't get me wrong. all of this really adds depth to the story, and the twists that happen throughout. Without it, the story would be boring, and it couldn't do what it does.
user2: Some sort of mother issues going on.

conversation:
user1: This 2016 movie gets great reviews!
user2: It does - it's surprising to me. I had high expectations.
user2: Did it meet your expectations?
user1: I think its very clever how La La Land represents Los Angelese, the sixt note of the major musical scale, and the term for being out of touch!
user1: I actually havent seen it yet.
user2: The title is novel but I thought it was quite overrated. Maybe because I'm from LA - there was a lot of hype.
user2: What type of movies do you like? 
user1: interesting, but rotten Tomatoes did give it 92% that's a very high rating.
user2: Not only was it given a high rating by Rotten Tomatoes, but many friends of mine also personally vouched for the movie.
user1: Ryan Gosling as a Jazz pianist seems like a good fit.
user2: I think it didn't deliver for me personally because I had high expectations.
user2: Ryan Gosling is nice to look at but I don't think he was the best fit.
user2: His dancing and singing was mediacore.
user2: mediocre.
user1: oh, yeah? well, The scene where Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation sounds intriguing!
user1: Apparently he goes on to play in a 1980's cover band!
user2: Sure but it didn't seem like he was really playing the piano.
user1: oh thats disappointing.
user1: some say the movie does sag in the middle.
user2: But you may enjoy it.
user2: It does, but if you like romantic comedies and musicals you may like this.
user2: It has a serious theme but is presented in a light hearted manner.
user1: thats wonderful, looks like its been called the years most pleasurable entertainment.
user2: I don't know about that but everyone's entitled to their opinion.
user1: treasuring things that are vanishing is very relate-able in my opinion.
user2: Sure - the message of the movie is something everyone can relate to.
user2: Do you know of other movies that have a similar message?
user1: im sure some are around, but back to this movie, i see some have called it a little dull. Some even said the singing and dancing were not exceptional, sounds like you may agree with them.
user2: I definitely would in terms of the singing and dancing. I've seen better.
user2: It was good for 2 actors doing it though.
user1: yeah Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone must have worked hard.
user1: What a noble quest the character has,  to save the traditionally black music genre from extinction.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user2: Have you heard of lala land?
user1: I actually have heard of that movie
user2: Dont see it
user1: Why not?
user2: its not worth it at all, I mean emma stone and ryan gosling are great actors
user2: but in this movie they are not
user2: It makes no sense at all and it seems to be just a waste of time movie
user1: I like Emma Stone but have never like Ryan
user2: He wants to save black music genre
user2: but why would they have a white guy doing that, thats dumb
user1: Is that the only big actors in it
user2: Yes
user2: that are worth it
user1: Which music genre is it about?
user2: its about the black music genre
user1: When did it come out?
user2: thats what they call it they dont even know proper terms in the movie
user2: the moviesags badly in the middle, lie a worn out mattress that needs new springs
user1: Seems like something they should of used other actors for
user2: Its not this years most pleasurable entertainment
user2: Its dull, and the leads are NOT exceptional, and sebastian is a jazz snob and mia lacks depth
user1: They could of gotten much better people to represent jazz
user2: Yea i know
user1: Do you know which company produced it?
user2: Its based in LA too
user1: LA is not the center for Jazz so it seems like they did no research
user2: THe performance of ryan was not great at all either
user1: Im sure Jazz started south somewhere around Louisian and Ryan is one of my least favorite actors 
user1: The movie needed someone who was from Jazz culture helping to direct it i thin
user1: So what would you rate the movie out of 10?
user2: I would give it a 2
user2: And thats with me just being nice
user1: With a rating that low I think I will watch something else and not waste my time

conversation:
user2: Hey
user1: hello
user2: Have you seen La La Land?
user1: no, I have not
user2: Are you a fan or musicals with drama and romance?
user1: no not usually
user1: I like music but not musicals
user2: I feel like you might like this one though. It starts as a Jazz-pianist and an actress meeting and going for their dreams.
user2: What type of music are you into?
user1: everything but country
user2: Oh nice, are you a fan of John Legend?
user1: do you think that people were vaild to rate this movie so high?
user1: is it really worth seeing?
user2: I actually do. It was even nominated for Oscars.
user2: I feel like it's a good movie to check out
user2: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were really amazing in this movie.
user1: I think some people think the movie is a little dull, that the singing and dancing are exceptional, what do you think?
user2: The singing and dancing is exceptional. There hasn't been a musical this raved for since Les Miserables. It would be considered dull if you really do not like musicals.
user1: do you think it's kind of sad that Sabastian has to take a job he doesn't like?
user1: it seems like they main actor and actress can't catch a break in the movie.
user2: I do sadly. Sebastian just wanted a better opportunity but he had to do it in expense to his happiness.
user2: I agree
user1: well it's definitely a drama then.
user2: It is especially when Mia accuses him of abandoning his dreams.
user1: how is this movie a romance if they break up in the end? 
user1: it should not be considered one because of that!
user2: Well because they go through a relationship through this movie. They were in love with each other
user1: It just seems very sad, not the kind of ending one would hope for.
user2: Oh I agree but it is refreshing considering most movies end in a happy romantic ending 
user1: I dislike this movie for being so sad, it makes me feel sad.
user1: I think movies are suppose to make you feel happy or good, and this one does the opposite. 
user2: Just because it has a sad ending doesn't mean that the movie is bad.
user1: i think Sabastian should have kept looking to make his dream possible.
user1: He could work but hope one day he could do what he wanting to do.
user2: I agree. If I was Sebastian, I would have looked for a better opportunity.
user1: *wanted
user2: I agree
user1: the same should go for Mia, work but keep trying and hoping for better.
user2: Oh yeah true. Mia shouldn't have given up on her dreams.
user1: she could use the feedback for her play and work on getting better
user1: *from
user2: Yes I would do that if I was Mia.
user1: it's a very serious movie, it deals with things that could really happen to poeple.
user2: It is a very serious movie yet enjoyable.
user1: i think Mia should have been more supportive to Sabastian, he has to make money somehow. 
user2: I agree. Sebastian wanted to provide and he should be given a chance to do so.

conversation:
user1: hey 
user2: hey
user1: i just watched la la land. It is a movie from 2016 starring ryan gosling and emma stone. they are too artists (one actress and one panist) and they fall in love and try to achieve their dreams.
user1: its a great movie 
user2: It's a wonderful movie and got a score of 92% on rotten tomatoes
user1: yes, i think it also won an oscar
user2: Yes but I thought it was a little dull
user1: metacritics rating is 93/100 as well
user1: its pretty critically acclaimed
user2: the two leads singing and dancing weren't exceptional
user1: i suppose it is not for everyone
user2: It also sags badly in the middle 
user2: I like how Sebastian slipped into a passionate jazz despite warnings from the owner.
user1: what do you think of the cover of "i ran so far away?" 
user1: in the movie, sebastian found the song an insult for a serious musician
user2: I don't know, it is considered an insult for serious musicians
user2: not sure why
user1: yeah
user2: The idea of a one woman play was daring
user1: it was interesting how sebastian joined a jazz fusion band
user1: he couldnt find real happiness in any of the bands he was in
user1: its hard 
user2: It is considering she didn't know of any of that
user2: until she attended one of his concerts
user1: yeah, that is daring 
user1: the movie kind of speaks to a lot of people. 
user1: she accussed him of abandoning his dreams 
user1: but sometimes thats what you have to do. 
user2: Not nice that she leaves because he told her she liked him better when he was unsuccessful
user2: The play was a disaster so he didn't miss anything when he missed it. 
user1: yeah, but i dont blame her for dumping him for that 
user2: She should didn't want to support him and she had to move back
user1: id be pretty upset as well
user1: to boulder city
user1: nevada
user2: yes she didn't want to forgive him, I didn't understand that
user1: well because that was a big deal to her and he missed it
user2: if she was with him when he was unsuccessful, she could have supported him to follow his dreams
user2: or other dreams
user1: i suppose that is true
user2: she wasn't successful either
user1: yeah she wasnt
user1: nobody showed up
user1: to her play
user2: so why the big hulabaloo about him
user1: not sure
user2: she was selfish I guess
user2: He missed her play because he had to go for a photo shoot with the band that he had previously missed
user1: yeah but he should have kept better track
user1: and scheduled it better
user2: this shows that he was trying to commit some and follow his dreams although not necessarily like them
user2: so she would be please if he didn't attend the photo shoot a second time, and came to her show
user1: i definitely felt bad for both of them though in that scene
user2: it's more of a do or don't he is still condemned
user2: I feel bad for him because he tried
user2: he tried to get her back by apologizing as well
user2: she didn't want any of it
user1: yeah because she felt like he didnt care enough because he missed it
user1: he's the one that suggested the one woman play
user2: They could have started all over again just like the beginning
user1: maybe so
user2: did she fail because of the one-woman play?
user2: she could have tried something else if she felt that
user1: she wanted to give it a shot
user2: she did and it failed, he did and it failed
user2: they just had to compromise
user2: so they could be together again, which was how the happiness was 
user2: He signed up for the band after hearing her talking to her mom about how he is working on his career
user2: I think he did a lot for her

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user1: I just watched this movie, did you like it?
user2: It seems interesting. The naming of the characters is odd. Sebastian & Mia vs Keith & Tracy. 
user1: Yeah, I found it a bit hard to follow.
user2: Do you know what shot in "cinema scope" means? 
user1: No, I do not
user1: I think it might be uber widescreen or something
user2: I'll Google it later. 
user1: The critical response it incoherent
user1: it's like they looked up words in a thesaurus to put in their reviews
user2: I enjoy Jazz, but piano really isn't my favorite kind. I find pianos to dominate the soundscape and leave little room for other instruments. What do you think? 
user1: I've  never really listened to jazz that didn't have piano in it
user2: Yes, they are getting good use of of their thesaurus!
user2: Sebastian sounds like a real piece of work. He is supposed to play Christmas songs, and instead he improvs? 
user1: yeah, I was think that that would end up badly, but it didn't
user1: they could have used that to good effect, but oh well
user2: He got fired, but met Mia. I guess that worked out for him. 
user1: yeah, always the cliche
user1: something bad happens, but something really good happens to balance it out!
user1: did it seem out of touch with reality? Cause I thought it did.
user2: It must have been so disheartening to Seb as a character when he had to play music he didn't like to pay the bills. 
user2: I don't know, doing something you don't love to pay the bills seems in touch with reality to me. 
user1: Yes!
user2: And, him brushing Mia off when they first meet and then later getting together seems to be in tune with the general idea that "women love jerks."
user1: In touch with reality again!
user2: The argument that ended their relationship seemed quite believable to me, you? 
user1: If I was a musciian I would be ok with playing music I didn't really care for if it paid the bills...
user1: lol, and the ending
user2: I'd be okay with playing most music, for sure. At least it is music. 
user2: Better than being a starving burger-flipping musician that plays gigs a few times a month. 
user1: at least it didn't have a cheesy ending.
user2: Yeah, the ending was real. I enjoyed that. 
user1: yeah, career: skilled musician and fast food worker
user1: had good looking actors, like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
user2: I don't find Emma attractive. 
user1: it had a good rotten tomatoes score, which is in keeping with keeping it real I guess.
user1: Who is Damien Chazelle?
user2: A director I've never heard of. 
user1: white guy saving a black musical genre from extinction...
user2: lol
user2: I tend to not like musicals in general. The plot moves so slowly because of all the music. 
user1: yeah, I've never heard of pieces like "Summer Montage."
user1: I guess it was okay.
user1: the movie did sag badly in the middle. It did seem like worn out mattress to me, too.
user2: The worn out mattress was a very apt description. I can't think of any better way to describe it. 
user1: what other metaphors would you use?
user2: Moves at the speed of a sleepy sloth. 
user1: It seemed like soggy bread to me.
user1: One person said it was year's most pleasurable entertainment. But why though?
user2: They probably really like music. 
user1: But there's ituns
user2: true
user2: Do you normally watch romance movies?
user1: No, well, not willingly, gf dragged me to it
user2: Same. 
user1: continues along the lines of sagging/dragging metaphors.
user2: should we click "finish conversation" I'm not sure what more it wants us to talk about regarding this movie? 
user1: Yeah I'd say so.

conversation:
user2: Howdy
user1: Hi how are you
user2: have you seen this movie?
user1: yes i have
user1: did you see it
user2: nope
user2: didn't seem very interesting from the ads
user1: oh, ok well it was not terrible but I think it was very overhyped
user1: I like the actors but have seen them in better roles
user2: I only know Gosling from internet memes.  haven't seen any of his stuff
user1: oh haha, he is actually a good actor but this was not my favorite movie of his
user1: it was a musical and was about Gosling being a jazz musician
user1: he meets this girl who is an actress and they have a romance set to music with really colorful backgrounds
user1: the scenery was nice at least haha
user2: I'm from LA.  Jazz musicians here (white ones, especially) are mostly self-important prigs.  Is that the character he plays?
user1: yes it was
user1: and you are pretty spot on with that
user1: white guy likes jazz, wow how novel 
user1: that could have been the title of the film
user2: Stone is a good actress.  She can pull off everything from humble girl next door to slutty temptress.
user1: I like her too. She was really good in Birdman
user1: I think she won an Oscar for this movie but I could be wrong
user2: I'm getting the sense that you're an AI.
user1: AI
user1: artificial intelligence
user2: What about it?
user1: oh you said you were getting the sense that I'm an AI
user1: didnt know what that meant
user2: okay
user1: are you an AI?
user2: At least one of us is not.
user1: So Im talking to a bot
user2: AT LEAST one of us...
user1: well Im a human
user2: :)
user1: Im not surprised if you are AI
user2: Both of the people in this movie sound insufferable.
user1: these damn Mechanical Turk hits are always so random
user1: they kind of were insufferable
user1: should we hit finish conversation? I want to make sure we talked long enough to get paid
user2: They both sound like the circle jerk fantasy of Hollywood types.
user1: Hollywood is one giant circle jerk
user2: Was it 15 comments that were required?
user1: At least John Legend was in the movie, he is pretty cool
user1: the end of the film was pretty depressing
user2: how so?
user1: they dont end up together
user1: it was like all that nonsense and romance for nothing
user1: but I guess that is reality
user2: Well, true to life.  Artists tend to find it very difficult to settle down.  Too much self-sacrifice required.
user2: Think we're good?
user1: I see that this filmed scored really well with critics
user1: yeah i think we talked about the film and covered the bases

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi there, Wow, LaLa Land is a musical, I didn't know that.
user2: did you?
user1: Yes, I enjoyed that the actors did all their own singing and dancing!
user1: Do you like jazz music?
user1: Do you think it matters that the movie uses white actors but relies heavily on art forms traditionally associated with black culture?
user2: How neat, seems like a lot of work. 
user2: oh sorry that didn't answer your question, that was a response to your previous remark.
user1: What do you think of it being shot in Cinemascope?
user2: thats a good question & Im not sure. I think jazz speaks to all kinds of people & those who love it know its roots.
user2: I like the use of color thought the movie.
user1: It's very brightly colored, that's true.  Do you think that adds to the mood of the film?
user1: Did you enjoy the scene where the two lead actors first meet?
user2: in the restaurant, i felt bad for him when he got fired. 
user2: it was christmas.
user1: Agreed.  I liked how that scene showed how serious he felt about music.
user2: yes, you are right. did you think it was funny when she ran into at the party?
user1: Yes! I liked that he was in a cover band - it showed how difficult it is to make a living as a musician.
user1: What did you think of his career decision to play in a band he didn't love?
user2: Seems like tough decision, i thought the movie conveyed that well. 
user2: What did you think of her reaction at watching him onstage?.
user1: Yes. Both actors struggled.  I like that they encouraged each other - like when he encouraged her to write a play
user1: It was thoughtful -- it showed she knew him well and wanted him to be happy
user2: your very insightful
user2: Do you think they should have broken up when he missed her play?
user1: I'm not sure.  I think ultimately it was good for them.
user1: It would have been disingenuous for her to act against how she felt -- both of them were such emotional people who made decisions based on strong emotions
user1: What did you think of her decision to go home?
user2: true, i thought it was realistic for her to go home. But i hate that she had given up.
user2: you?
user2: I guess Nevada isn't so far away
user1: I thought it was a nice illustration of what it feels like to lose hope
user1: But also, because it was such a colorful, musical, film I felt confident that it would not end that way for her -- that she would go back and try again
user1: Did you feel that way?
user2: Yes, I did. At that point i was hoping it didn't end like that.
user2: I thought it was very realistic for her play to flop, also. 
user1: Yes, but I felt so bad for her.
user2: understandable but, if it would have been as success, it wold have been to easy. 
user1: What did you think when she overheard people saying unkind things?
user2: That it was rude but typical and a little sad because you felt she put a lot of work into it.
user1: Yes
user1: She tried so hard
user2: she did
user2: I did enjoy the audition scenes she did, that was funny.
user1: I agree!
user2: I liked seeing her against other versions of her type. 
user1: Yes Emma Stone has a lot of range
user2: Ryan too, I didn't know he could sing & dance.

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hello
user1: Our movie is "La La Land"
user2: Great
user2: Is it a comedy movie?
user1: I think you should watch this movie because not only is it about an interesting topic, but it mixes romance and comedy while introducing song.
user1: It doesn't sugar coat the ways of society, it's very real in the traditional black musical genre.
user2: I heard a lot about this movie. I know it had many awards for this movie.
user1: You're right and I believe it deserved all of the awards it was given.
user2: sound really interesting.
user2: It's Amazing to watch such movies
user1: I think so too
user1: I liked the scene where the main character breaks into song despite the warnings of his boss
user1: I thought it really showed persistence 
user2: I definetly enjoyed it too
user2: La La Land grossed $151.1 million in the United States and Canada and $295 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $446.1 million, against a production budget of $30 million.
user2: That's why i feel it's an Oscar winning movie
user1: The way the two meet is very interesting too
user1: It had such high ratings from critics which is hard to get
user2: Sure. I agree with you.
user1: The other main character, Mia played a key role in the movie's plot
user2: I agree with the work written and directed by Damien Chazelle
user2: great
user1: I think it's sweet that Sebastian takes on a job he doesn't particularly like to prove to Mia's mother that he's going somewhere with his career.
user2: True...that's really sweet
user1: But that all fizzles out when he misses the play that she has written for a photo shoot
user1: She finds that she cannot forgive him, which ends their relationship
user2: i felt really sad.
user2: I remeber this scene where Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; she teases him by requesting "I Ran (So Far Away)," a song he considers an insult for "a serious musician". After the gig, the two walk to their cars and lament wasting "A Lovely Night" together despite the clear chemistry between them.
user1: I also felt sad because it really all just seemed to be a misunderstanding
user2: Yes true.
user1: Yes, that was the beginning of the realtionship
user2: A great beginning
user1: Yes, and a tragic end
user2: True
user1: It really is an interesting love story, though
user2: yes with a end like this.
user2: Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and happily married to another man, with whom she has a daughter. One night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Noticing the "Seb's" logo she had once designed, Mia realizes Sebastian has opened his club. When Sebastian notices Mia in the crowd, he plays their love theme on the piano, and a dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what might have been had their relationship continued ("Epilogue"). Mia shares a poignant smile with Sebastian, then leaves with her husband.
user2: Amazing story...But such a difficult situation for Mia
user1: Still a tragic ending that they did not have the chance to end up together
user1: I agree with you, she made a hard choice
user2: definetly
user1: But I think Seb understood
user2: yes.
user2: He must have
user2: I think he had no other option
user1: Maybe he'll find his own happiness 
user2: True
user1: o
user1: I hope he will
user2: That's the way it is
user1: Do you generally like movies like this?
user2: Yes.
user1: I do alo
user1: alsi*
user2: I like the chemistry between both 
user1: I like the comedy part of it
user2: I cherish such movies. I definitely enjoyed the humor involved in it.
user1: Do you base your interest in a movie off of the ratings it receives
user1: ?
user2: Do you want to watch it again?
user1: Maybe sometime in the future, but not right away
user2: no
user2: great
user1: I don't either, I believe critics are too harsh most of the time
user2: I agree

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: would you please tell me the movie name
user1: Hi. The movie is La La Land.
user2: does it look like a good movie to watch? or a waste of time
user1: I think it looks like a good movie to watch. It is a musical, and it is both a fantasy but also a depiction of the harsh reality of life.
user2: a musical about the harsh reality of life.. you find that attractive>
user2: ?
user1: I find it though provoking. And maybe I find harsh reality easier to take with a song and dance.
user2: reality doesn't have to be harsh :P
user1: Well, this is a romantic *comedy*. It's not that harsh. More bittersweet.
user2: ok thanks a lot for the information
user2: and thanks for chatting with me'
user1: Are you interested in seeing the movie?
user2: not so much
user1: Do you like musicals? Or are you passionate about music? Because to a great extent, that is what the movie is about, people who are passionate about their art, and for one of the characters, that art is jazz.
user2: i am indeed passionate about my art.and i do love music
user2: maybe it is worth a try
user2: do you know how to get the finish conversation button to come up?
user1: I think there have to be a certain number exchanges for that button to come up. And I think it is timed.
user2: well i create my own music and i love to do art
user2: its possible i would like the movie
user1: Anyway, I think the movie is definitely worth a try if you're into music and understand the passion for what you do.
user1: One of the characters is desperately trying to "save" jazz, and risks everything for his art.
user2: I prefer good rap music. 
user2: stuff with clean language and motivating
user1: The other character (well, there are more than 2) is an actress, really trying to make it.There's no rap, but there is kind of a fusion thing at one point.
user2: the word fusion reminds me of dragonball
user2: thats definitely appealing
user1: I am not familiar with that.
user2: i love dragonball, its about superheroes and extreme power
user1: Not much like La La Land. Except for the power the characters have to make their dreams come true (or not, don't want to spoil it too much ;-) ).
user2: thats why i do mturk. to make my dream come true
user2: i want enough money in my bank to move to california
user1: So I think you *would* relate to the characters in the movie, as they make sacrifices for their art... and live in California, hence the title, La La Land. ;-)
user2: ok if its in california theres a 99% chance that i would like the movie
user1: It's all about life in Los Angeles. The title refers to the nickname of the city, but also the kind of dreamworld that they characters live in.
user2: ive been to los angeles
user1: I have never been, but I am going this summer. 
user2: i want to move to sunnydale'
user1: Isn't that the place in Buffy the Vampire Slayer?
user2: Yup, i got a ring with buffys name on it
user1: Cool. Is that a real place?
user2: yes
user1: Well, I hope your dreams come true. Good luck.
user2: good luck to you as well, thanks for your time
user1: And check out La La Land for inspiration!
user2: check out dragonball for the nicest superheroes
user1: Will do! Bye!
user2: bye :)

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: hello
user2: I understand you have a document about a movie to read to me?
user1: I think I'm suppossed to answer questions that you ask
user2: Hm, these are my instructions:
user1: The movie is "La La Land"
user2: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me what kind of movie it is?
user1: You ask questions and I akswer them based on the information about the film given to me
user2: Okay. What genre is the film?
user1: It says it's a musical romantic comedy drama.  It sounds awful
user2: I love musical comedies. Who does it star?
user1: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone
user2: Two of my favorites. What's it rated?
user1: There's no information on the rating
user2: What kind of IMDB rating has it gotten?
user1: IMDB is 8.1/10, which is pretty good if you can get around the jagged Oscar the Grouch face of Emma Stone
user2: Maybe the critics like Sesame Street, as do I. Thanks for the information.
user2: Um, who is it directed by?
user1: Damien Chazelle...apparently a white man trying to "save jazz" was an appealing project to him
user2: Who wouldn't love that? What else has he directed?
user1: I do'nt know and I wasn't given that information.  I can only use the information I've been given, I'm sorry.  However you seem interested so I can tell you that there are a lot of dance numbers in this film and it seems like most important sections involve some dance number
user2: That's right up my alley. Any information on who composed the musical score?
user1: While there's no information on who composed the score or choreographed the numbers, Emma Stone is constantly failing at auditions (Which seems pretty dumb to have a musical with good dancers playing bad dancers but what do I know) so that might be fun to watch if you have nothing better to do
user2: I have a thing for seeing Emma Stone overcoming adversity.
user2: Do you know if it has a happy ending?
user1: I'm not sure, but by the third major scene The two main characters are bitching at each other, with Emma Stone complaining that Ryan Gosling is giving up on his dreams.  I'm sure she says hee's not dancing enough WHILE DANCING.
user1: I would imagine it turns out sad in the end, be3cause Emma Stone moves away
user1: sorry, this UI is really clunky and hard to use and the text I've been given is very small so I keep having to resize the screen
user2: :(
user1: I have some infomation about critical response
user2: Well, you've been very helpful regardless. Anything else you can tell me about the film?
user2: That sounds good, what have they been saying about it?
user1: It's a bit mixed, with most saying they enjoyed it and a few claiming things such as lack of character development 
user2: I tend to believe the optimists in this instance. Thanks so much for your help today, Emma Stone would be proud of your perserverance in the face of adversity.

user2: Hello, 
user2: which Movie do you watch ?
user1: HI I WAS WATCH LA LA LAND MOVIE
user2: Interesting Name, What is there in this movie ?
user1: THIS MOVIE DIRECTED BY DAMIEN CHAZELLE AND STARS RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE
user1: RYAN GOSLING PLAYS AS A JAZZ PLANIST
user1: EMMA STONE AS AN ASPIRING ACTRESS
user1: DO YOU KNOW THAT MOVIE
user2: Ok, I know about Emma Stone she is good in acting, But i don't know much about this movie but i want to know ? is it Comedy Movie ?
user1: Yes, its a romantic Comedy-drama flim
user2: can you tell me the story in brief ?
user1: Ryan and Emma who meet and fall in love in los angeles while pursuing their dreams. this movie look like the worls that we dream about, but it also understands the cruelty that can come out of those dreams
user1: R u like the story?
user2: yes i like, as you told me the cast of the movie it seems that i should watch that movie 
user2: how much time has been past to this movie ?
user1: 2 years
user2: So do you like that movie ?
user1: yes i like that movie because they are perfect pair in the movie
user2: Ok, What were there Dreams in the Movie ?
user1: Sorry i don't know the dream

conversation:
user2: I really liked la la land its a musical which i do enjoy
user2: I think emma stone was fantastic in this movie hearing her range in vocals and her musical steps she was amazing
user1: Yes, it is a well crafted film with excellent dance numbers in it
user2: their romance in the film gets a little stale for a bit but it gets back on track and really hums at the end
user1: Emma Stone did do well in the film but I don't think she is an exceptional singer
user2: She really isnt thats why it kind of shocked me to hear her hit some notes 
user1: The film wasn't perfect but it was visually stunning
user2: Yes the visuals were amazing clear crisp the colors jumped off the page it seemed!
user1: I did not find Ryan Goslings character all that interesting. Emma Stone did a better job at grabbing my attention
user2: Exactly i dont dont know if he was told to act a little dull but he wasnt looking into it to me just eh ok in his performance i would say
user1: Although the film had a lot going for it I don't it is really all that good. There are better films
user2: I agree with you I think it was a little overhyped hoping people would be nostalgic about those types of films but it could of been better i agree totally 
user1: It doesn't really make sense that a white male is apparently the only one capable of reviving Jazz, which was traditionally black music.
user2: or how he just so happens to be more passionate about the culture than the people who created it was a little of a stretch
user1: exactly. The film would have made more sense if the cast a black lead
user2: another thing as a child of the 80's dissing 80's pop was not a good moment for those of a certain age like dude i liked that I ran song lol
user1: lol. true. true. Ryan Goslings character wasn't very likable in general tbh.
user2: overall i would give it maybe a 6 out of 10 only because of the visuals and  few dance scenes 
user1: same. The visuals were the best part of the movie. Other movies did a far better job with their story telling
user2: It seems like this movie came out a lot earlier than 2016 mainly because it was so eh bland but the critical respones from a lot of critics hyped it up to be all that. It did win a few awards so eh i guess
user2: looking at the rotten tomatoes rating of 92% seems a little high to me whew
user1: yeah. I think the critics liked it because it is a Hollywood movie that talks about why Hollywood is so great.
user1: It definitely did not diserve to be nominated for so many awards
user2: exactly thats a little why to this day when they laud some movie with saying how great it is i remain reserved to see it
user1: Yeah. That's also why I rely on the audience as well as the critics. Some times the critics just don't know a good movie when they see one and they over hype a bad one.
user2: like at least one critic commented is a jazz snob lol i think that comes across loud and clear lol
user1: exactly. critics need to think more critically about the movies they are watching
user2: have you watched anything else with gosiling in it that you enjoyed
user1: The notebook was good
user1: I think he did a better preformance in that then in la la land
user1: but I think that partly has to do with the director
user2: I agree the storyline and plot to la la land limited his acting chops alot

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello
user2: La La Land may look like the world that we dream about, but it also understands thecruelty that can come out of (or undermine) those dreams; it's shot in CinemaScope, andyet it's still an intimate masterpiece."
user2:  Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user2: ● Rotten Tomatoes: 92% and average: 8.6/10● Metacritics: 93/100● IMDB: 8.1/10
user2: i think the IMDB One it's a bit underrated compared with the others

user1: i have no idea
user2: okey

conversation:
user1: I thought that La La Land was a pretty good film. What did you think about it? 
user2: one of the reviews of the movie said that it was bad in the middle
user2: "sags bad in the middle"
user1: It did lag a little bit. I thought that Emma Stone did a good job though. Are you familiar with her work?
user2: No really. Do you generally watch movies with bad plots like La La Land
user1: Not really, I don't really like musicals all that much. 
user1: I wasn't really a big fan of the ending, to be honest. 
user2: Me neither. Do you agree with the rating the movie got?
user1: To be honest, I think that it's a little high for what the movie deserved.
user2: I feel the same way. Do you like comedy dramas though? I love them
user1: I don't think they're bad, what kind of movies are you thinking about?
user2: Not sure. But in the first scene I find Sebastian sort of full of himself by blowing off Mia. How do you feel?
user1: I agree, I didn't really like Sebastian as a character. I felt he was too arrogant. 
user2: Way too arrogant. It was really difficult to like especially when they introduced him to us this way. I thought that Mia was way too into him when she requested the song, in my opinion.
user1: Yeah, I think that they got too involved in things too fast and I know that was a point of the movie but I think it was a bit unrealistic even for movie standards.
user2: Yes. I agree. Maybe they had chemistry I don't know. 
user2: It's nice that Sebastian finally got a gig though.
user1: Yeah, I think at the end everyone was happy, even if it wasn't with each other.
user1: That's a movie trope you don't usually see because usually the main couple works it out in the end.
user2: I like how this movie deviated away from that.
user1: Yeah, it made the ending really surprising. I didn't see it coming. Not a lot of movies are like that nowadays.
user1: With Hollywood remaking everything, endings are becoming really predictable. 
user2: Yes it was nice for this movie to move from the norm. I really like Ryan's acting though.
user1: Yeah, he's not a bad actor. I think that he was better here than he was in The Notebook. 
user2: Their argument was intense. It felt real almost.
user1: Yeah, I think that was further proof of the good chemistry between the actors. I think that they did a good job casting their roles. 
user2: I wholeheartedly agree. They were perfect.
user2: I did find it heartbreaking when Sebastian said Mia only loved him when he was down on his luck or unsuccessful.
user1: Yeah, I thought that was a really realistic drama element added to the story, like I could see people really fighting about that. 
user2: Yes a Sebastian missing the play. Things spun out of hand. What did you think of Mia's play?
user1: I thought that it was really good, like I like how Mia really put her all into every role that she was in.
user2: She did. I feel like she wanted to be supported the way she supported him.
user1: Yeah, I think that she got that at the end of the play though. 
user2: Yeah you're right.
user2: I'm glad that we were able to see that.
user1: Yeah, it looks like we've been talking for enough time now. It was good talking to you. 
user2: Same

conversation:
user1: What did you think about La La Land?
user2: I thought it was okay. I'm not usually a fan of romantic comedies but this one was pretty good
user1: I am not big into musicals for the most part, but this one was decent. How did you like the setting?
user2: I feel hollywood settings are in general over done, but the movie spoke to me on another level. It was engaging and distracted from the cliche. I understand the movie wasn't really about the setting but about other things like dying dreams or persuing something though you know you might not succeed. 
user1: I think a Hollywood backdrop was ideal for the telling of a story about dreaming, and perhaps losing those dreams somewhere along the way. Ryan Gosling is not the greatest actor in the world. So that is a solid minus.
user2: Yeah, it worked for the story, but I'd prefer another setting occasionally. Ryan Gosling has his looks, but isn't Leonardo. I like him a lot better. I wish Leonardo would have been able to play the role more than Ryan.
user1: I can completely agree with the Leonardo idea. It got pretty good ratings. I do not really know what the percentage on Rotten Tomatoes means for sure tho. 
user2: I guess the rating means how much people like it in general? It looks like it got pretty good ratings from other people. I'm not sure I would have rated it that high personally. 
user1: I would not rated it that high. It seems to be sorta saggy in the middle like most romance movies.
user2: I find a lot of movies actually have this lull period. Romantic comedies do have more than most. I also find it only satisfying based on the ending of the movie. If it's too sweet, I roll my eyes. If its bitter, it's not a romantic comedy at that point. It's a fine balance, which La La Land pulled off decently. I wouldn't say it could go to the Oscars though
user1: I did not really get why Sebastian would play something outside the setlist of Christmas songs. It was to setup the girl seeing his passion, but you are getting paid to play. Do your job.
user2: Yeah, I know right? It makes him seem even more like a snob more than the rest of the movie. He could have just as easily played a christmas song with improv, like Jaz is famous for, and shown his passion through that song. It's what a great musician does. 
user1: I would also assume most women are not wanting to compliment or date a freshly fired man, but romantic comedies also show such foolishness. It is much harder to chat to a random person than I thought. Isn't it a bit odd for you?
user2: Yeah, romantic comedies aren't really known for their rational thought process. A lot of decisions seem based on folly and 'love'. They describe love in a way that would never make sense in the real world. I'm actually okay talking to you. I wrote my thesis on animated films so it's similar enough that I do just fine. 
user1: I would think  a romance that embraced the cold, rational world could actually show emotion better than a sugar-coated tale. I am not an artist so what do I know anyway. Also if the fellow is in a pop cover band. Then I would assume his life of being a serious musician is over.
user2: Yeah. I agree with that one. I'm not in the theater to avoid the harsh realities of the world. I go to see someone overcome the world in a way. To see things can get better. It's my favorite part anyway. A pop cover band does seem a dead end path, so I didn't understand why he would even choose that one. Just because he was fired from one spot doesn't mean he can't go to another? And if the city is so dead, why not move to another city? There were just so many questions left open ended.
user1: They then move in together and the fellow is offered steady pay, and he takes it. I thought this guy was so passionate he would get fired for not following a set list, but he will do this for her. I just do not buy it. 
user2: He did seem to change personalities in the movie a lot. They make it seem like the guy is always required to fill a certain role. Then the girl sees his sacrifice. I'm just not a fan of that particular type of romance. It doesn't feel real. I thought it was fun enough, but these are some of the big pot holes in the movie. Besides, why would she be so 'disturbed' by the fact he was doing it? The intentions and depth of character doesn't seem to be there for me.
user1: Yeah, she would not be disturbed. I could see feeling somewhat guilty. IF the band is being successful just ride the gravy train. Then when you get enough cash do what you want. So many great artists have followed paths like this, but it is rarely in movies.
user2: I agree with you. It seemed more natural to feel moved and deeply connected to him because he would make a sacrifice except his sacrifice was not exactly a sacrifice. I mean, most people would kill for a chance to play in front of an audience. His sacrifice was that he was a snob and he had to 'lower' himself to some station beneath him. This is not the kind of guy to end up with. It makes him seem arrogant. This type of guy usually ends up being the villain but because its a rom com it's okay.
user1: This would be significantly easier if I had actually watched this movie. I can get the idea from this written format, but this is pretty tiring. Did you watch this movie? 
user2: I haven't seen it. I heard it was a rom com and avoided it. I usually prefer suspense, action thrillers, sci fi and the such.This sounds actually kind of bad for a rom com. Maybe it was better watching the movie than reading it. The scenes just sound so bad.
user1: Yeah. This truly does sound horrible, and that is why I avoided it like the plague. So this next scene they get into an argument, he misses her play and the play sucked(surprise). That is some truly horrible writing and setup. I think it would best if these two stay away from each other.
user2: They really don't seem like they should end up together. THough, it would have been ingenius to actually set it up this way and have him realize how stuck up he had been, go and apologize heart felt then try to help her out more. Just missing the play and having her go away seems like it wouldn't influence him out of such behavior though. Then maybe she could agree she hadn't been the best either. Maybe he then tries to 'follow his dreams' in a bit nicer more down to earth fashion and she can follow her dreams in such a way as well. I'm not sure. It sound better that way to me. Not realistic still though
user1: That does seem a bit abrupt, and I do not know what purpose it serves in the narrative. It would feel much more real if she stayed and just wallowed in her guilt while he wasted away doing something he actively disliked. Their love would be keeping them together in the most tragic way possible.
user2: Then it wouldn't be a rom com. It would just be drama. That's kinda funny in it's own way though. Well, in the story, it needs some sort of saving grace. He needs at least to be more grateful and get off this tangent he's on. She needs to say something about it and grow up.

user2: hii
user1: Hi, how are you.  Have you seen the movie La La Land yet?  It almost won best movie's oscar until the mis reading on the card. Still it was quite an unusual movie in that it was a musical
user2: well,i not yet watched that movie
user2: is that movie look like so interesting 
user1: I think its something to see. It stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who actually have been in a few movies together.  It is somewhat a cultural event in that it got a lot of buzz when released. 
user2: wow,really great.emma stone actually played a role in that.that means this will look so good 
user1: Yes, it had amazing ratings.  She was actually an aspiring actress in the movie so that is realistic.  She meets Gosling's character who is a jazz pianist.  
user2: wow,so nice to hear this.and when this movie is released 
user1: It was released in 2016.  It is called La La Land since it is set in Los angeles
user2: what is the movie concept? adventure or romace
user1: It is a romance between the two characters in that she is an actress and he is a jazz player who wants to save jazz clubs because they are fading 
user2: than this movie want to be watched with our love one.than only it will gives a perfect meaning to the movie
user1: I agree. I think its worth it to see it.  Like I said although it was in 2016 it is timely even today. You do not see a lot of adult type musicals out. They are all animated for kids.  It even has some comedy and tension.  When Gosling as his character Sebastian wants to play jazz improvisation songs, his boss tells him to stick to christmas songs.  
user1: Its not all happy and sappy though. In fact after that restaurant scene when he wants to play jazz he gets fired. Stone's character is in the club but he really pays her no attention and they do not meet for months later
user1: Are you still there ?
user1: we need minimum discussions for credit here 

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi
user2: So have you seen lalaland?
user1: Yes, I have, a few times actually. Have you?
user2: Yes.
user1: What did you think?
user2: I love it.
user1: Same here
user2: I see why rotten tomatoes gave it a high score, 92%
user1: The first time I watched it, I wasnt so sure that Id like it. The opening number was kind of boring to tell you the truth.
user2: I am surprised the average is only 8.6
user2: I liked it but fair enough.
user2: Do you like the opening with ryan gosling at his gig?
user2: The christmas music debacle part?
user1: Yes, that was pretty cool. I liked the piano part.
user1: It set up a nice melody which was played several times throughout the movie.
user2: I also thought he party scene was funny.
user2: Yes the music is such an integral part of this film.
user1: Plus also how we got to see how he wished the scene played out if he had been more brave.
user2: Emma's character was certainly brave deciding to write and perform a one woman show.
user1: Yes, the 80's music was fun to listen to. Seeing such an established artist reduced to playing a keyboard guitar at a party lol
user2: Did you feel as mia did about his other band? disturbed?
user1: Yeah, no kidding! I didnt get the impression that she believed in herself that much, but as the movie went on, she grew confidence!
user1: Maybe being in love helped her with that
user2: agreed.
user1: I wish there would be a sequel or a play adapation
user1: adaptation*
user2: Maybe one day. 
user1: To me, it was made for the live stage.
user2: I think it was so wrong of ryan's character sebastien to miss her show.
user1: Well, clearly he regretted that as shown by the montage at the end.
user2: I don't know if It woudl be very easy to stage.
user2: Yes, true.
user1: I don't think it would have changed much though. She would still have gone to paris I think.
user2: It is rather heartbreaking.
user1: Yeah, good movie overall. I listen to the soundtrack on my longruns sometimes too. Puts a pep in my step lol
user2: Damien chazelle as director really did a great job.
user2: I wonder if he wrote themusic too?
user1: Yes, completely agreed.. that im not sure! I'd be surprised. that'd be a lot of roles for one person, dont you think?
user2: Yes, it woudl be alot,
user1: It should have won best picture though.. such a shame what happened at the oscars though.
user2: I am just happy he brought back a musical.
user1: Yes, agreed.

conversation:
user1: Haii
user2: HELLO
user1: where are u?

conversation:
user2: Hey What do you think of this movie?
user1: What was this movie's name again?
user2: La La Land....I've heard of this one.
user1: Right it seems like it would be an interesting movie. It also seems different from the mainstream movies.
user2: 92% is a pretty good rating so the movie must be good.   Yes, I like that it is an idiom for being out of touch with reality.
user1: Wow that is a pretty high rating for a movie. There must be some good actors in the film as well to be so high.
user2: It has a good cast.  Ryan Gosling is a good actor as well as Emma Stone.
user1: I have heard of those actors before. Then the comments must be pretty good about the movie
user2: People are bragging on the movie saying it is a great romantic comedy.  They say it's very touching as well.
user1: So it seems like a movie for me

user1: Do you know of other big actors that are in it?
user2: John Legend and Callie Hernandez
user1: Can I hear more about the plot?
user2: Here's one of the key scenes: 
user2: During a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warningsfrom the owner to stick to the setlist of traditional Christmas songs. Mia overhears the music asshe passes by ("Mia and Sebastian's Theme"). Moved, she enters the restaurant, but Sebastian isfired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes heroff.Months later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; sheteases him by requesting "I Ran (So Far Away)", a song he considers an insult for "a seriousmusician". After the gig, the two walk to their cars, lamenting each other's company despite thechemistry between them ("A Lovely Night").
user2: I haven't seen the movie either
user1: The sounds good is the movie still in theaters?
user2: No it was from 2016
user2: Here's the next key scene:
user2: After more failed auditions, Mia decides, at Sebastian's suggestion, to write a one-womanplay. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club ("Summer Montage"), and the twomove in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in hisjazz fusion band, where he will be offered a steady income. Although he is dismayed by theband's pop style, Sebastian signs after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother thatSebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but when Mia attends one oftheir concerts ("Start a Fire") she is disturbed, knowing Sebastian does not enjoy theirmusic.
user2: I'm not a big fan of musicals but I do like the leading actors
user1: Yeah the actors are good. What songs are in the movie?
user2: Looks like a bunch of original stuff
user1: Who is the director?
user2: "Mia and Sebastian's Theme"
user2: I Ran (So Far Away)
user2: Alovely Night
user2: Summer Montage
user2: Start a Fire 
user2: That's everything I see so far
user1: Okay, what is it rated?
user1: R, PG-13, PG?
user2: Doesn't say
user2: I'd imagine it's not R though
user2: Here's the third key scene:
user2: During the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument; she accuses him ofabandoning his dreams, while he claims she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Mialeaves, insulted and frustrated. Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a band photo shoot thathe had previously forgotten. The play is a disaster; few people attend, and Mia overhearsdismissive comments. Sebastian attempts to apologize to Mia for missing the play, but sheis unwilling to forgive him and ends their relationship. Despondent and unable to pay the

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: La La Land is a critically acclaimed musical starting Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  It has very high ratings at sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritics.
user2: What kind of ratings did it get?
user1: On Rotten Tomatoes, it received a 92% and an average of 8.6/10.  On Metacritics, it received 93/100.
user2: That's really good for rotton tomatoes. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. What is the musical about?
user1: It is a romantic comedy-drama wherein a jazz pianist (Gosling) and an aspiring actress (Stone) fall in live in LA while pursuing their dreams.
user2: That sounds interesting! Is it set in modern times  or in the past?
user1: Interestingly, it is tough to tell.  That may be a cinematic component in the main characters being out of touch with reality.
user2: That would be interesting indeed. I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but would consider going to see it. When does it come out in theaters?
user1: It came out in 2016.
user2: I see. I hadn't heard of it and thought it was something new. Why do you say that the characters may be out of touch with reality?
user1: For example, in one key scene, the pianist, Sebastian (Gosling), slips into passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from his boss to stick to traditional Christmas songs to entertain the restaurant-goers.  This gets him fired.
user2: Wow, that's intense. Was there a specific reason why he defied his boss? Was he trying to impress the girl? 
user1: He just loves jazz that much and he wants to pursue his dream at any cost.  He actually brushes off Mia (Stone) when she attempts to compliment him after he is fired.
user2: So it isn't about the girl at all and he is really passionate about his music. Does it say where love interest comes into play?
user1: Well, there is inevitable chemistry between the two main characters.  You first see it when Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he is playing in a 1980s pop cover band. 
user2: I see. So it seems that the musical is set in the past but not too distant. Was the movie nominated for any awards?
user1: It was, but we were just getting to the most interesting part of the plot!  Inspired by Sebastian's commitment to his dream of becoming a jazz performer, Mia writes a one-woman play.
user2: Is Mia an actress? Does she ask Sebastian to compose the music for the play?
user1: She is an aspiring actress, but like Sebastian, struggling in LA.  He does not compose music for the play, but instead begins to perform regularly at a jazz club.
user2: Does Sebastian get a break in his career? Is Mia's play successful?
user1: Sebastian joins a former classmate's band for steady income even though he is dismayed by the band's pop style.  That band does find success.
user2: How does the relationship between Sebastian and Mia turn out. Do they end up being together?
user1: During the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument: Mia accuses him of abandoning his dreams.  Sebastian, in turn, thinks she liked hime more when he was struggling and unsuccessful.
user2: What does Sebastian do? Does he leave the band to get back to his roots or continue touring with the band?
user1: He actually misses Mia's first performance of her play due to a band photo shoot.  
user2: So there is a struggle between Mia and Sebastian. Do they find a way to make things work?
user1: Sebastian attempts to apologize to Mia for missing the play, but she is unwilling to forgive him and ends their relationship.  Mia then leaves LA and goes back home to Boulder City, Nevada.
user2: Is that how it ends or do they reunite. Is there a happy ending?

conversation:
user1: Rotten tomatoes gave this movie a 92... would you agree?
user2: well. i haven't seen it so i can only judge by what i'm reading here. 
user1: For a person that didn't watch the movie... it seems it got alot of buzz due to the actors
user2: yeah. ryan gosling is great.
user2: and emma stone.
user1: I had no clue that John legend was acting
user2: me either. i also didn't know this movie was a musical.
user2: looks like some critics didn't like it despite the really good ratings.
user1: it says its a romantic comedy too
user2: yeah; that part sounds good if you're in the mood for that sort of thing
user1: I thought the comment that was made towards the movie : worn out mattress that needs new springs.. was hilarious
user2: yeah. lol.
user2: well, it sounds like a cheesy romance - he disses her, then they meet up again months later.
user1: I agree
user1: After being rude.. he gets the girl
user2: lol.
user2: i find it comical when an actress plays an aspiring actress.
user2: i wonder if ryan gosling actually played the piano in this.
user1: I didn't think of that... and its hilarious.. only because she a well known actress
user1: it say he plays the keyboard
user2: well, they're supposed to be following their dreams but it sounds like sebastian isn't entirely following his
user2: playing music he doesn't like - doesn't sound like a dream
user1: I agree
user2: and what does she care what her mother thinks? what is she, 12? lol.
user1: he sound like he doesn't have passion
user1: a job is a job to him
user2: yeah; not for that!
user1: Since she an aspiring actress maybe she is very young out in LA
user2: perhaps.
user2: well, this movie doesn't sound so great so far - they are both failing at following their dreams.
user1: Ryan sounds like a jerk
user2: hahah. yeah. he misses the play he told her to write.
user1: The movie doesn't seem to go... I think I'll pass on watching

conversation:
user1: Hi! So what did you think of the critically acclaimed film "La La Land"?
user2: I found it a little dull
user2: I mean, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are neither singing nor dancing very excaptional
user1: I'd love to hear more! What did find full about it!
user2: What do you think?
user1: I was mixed... I'm not a fan of musicals.
user2: I liked that on the one hand, it seems like a film about the world that we dream about, but on the other hand showed the cruelty of the world as it is
user2: Or more or less about the cruelty that can come out of those dreams
user1: I understand your viewpoint and agree completely. I feel the all in all, It was overrated and didn't deserve the high ratings it received on Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritics and IMDB.
user1: I thought Damien Chazelle did a great job directing. What about you?
user2: Yes! Espeacially in the middle it turned really boring
user2: Agree
user2: I find it exceptional that she managed to create a romantic comedy and a rhapsody at the same time
user1: Agreed. I felt sorry for Sebastian when he was fired at first.
user2: At first?
user1: After he was fired, but then I realized it happened for a reason as it basically introduced him to Mia.
user2: Yeah, I guess in the end we don´t have to be sorry for him anymore :)
user1: Very true. What did you think of the chemistry between the two at first?
user2: Did you find the film entertaining then?
user2: When they walked together to their cars, it was clear for me that there was a chemistry
user2: Even though they didn´t want to accept it
user1: Somewhat. There were aspects I liked and didn't like. Like you, I found parts of it dull. I loved John Legends portrayal of Keith. Were there any characters you favored?
user1: Agreed. It was apparent during the "A Lovely Night" song.
user2: I really loved Callie Hermandez as Tracy!
user2: Btw: Are you a real person?
user1: She did a great job and I loved it as well!
user2: Yes, that was the moment when I think everyone in the cinema noticed there was a chemistry
user2: What did you think about the argument Mia and Sebastian had about his dreams and success?
user1: So true... then it grew deeper, causing them to move in together!
user1: I hate she accused him of abandoning his dreams as I know he felt he was doing the right thing. How about you?
user2: Dunno. In a way, she had a point there
user2: And he just missed her play not long after
user2: If I were her, I´d have been really frustrated, too
user1: And she did I agree. It was justified. 
user1: She had every reason to say that!
user1: How did you feel about the break up?
user2: If I were her, I´d probably also have moved back home
user2: Even though it was very sad, of course
user2: What do you think?
user1: Same here.  I would have as well! Especially if I was unable to pay the theater back!
user1: It's sad how it unfolded though. 
user2: Agreed. Even though the thing with the theater wasn´t his fault
user1: Setting the musical aspect aside, What did you like most about it?
user2: I loved the modd the film creates. Like, the bittersweet happiness of treasuring something, which is vanishing
user1: That is a great point. I liked the romantic comedy aspect of it the most!
user2: Yep. And it really has a fizzy fantasy
user1: Indeed! A fizzy fantasy and hard headed fable!
user2: It´s great how they managed to make the film both, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama at the same time
user1: Is there anything else of note you liked or disliked? Of course, I disliked the musical aspect the most
user2: I also didn´t like the characters too much
user2: I mean, Sebastian was really a snob
user2: A jazz snob :D
user1: I understand. Indeed he was while Mia was trying to pursue a career in acting.
user1: Well, stranger, I think we've reached the end! I enjoyed chatting with you about La La Land!
user2: Me too!
user2: Very nice to talk to you, stranger
user1: Have a great evening! I wish you peace and happiness! I enjoyed this discussion!

conversation:
user1: Did you see La La Land?
user2: Yes I did! What were the names of the main cast again?
user1: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. 
user1: What do you think of the critical responses?
user2: I'm impressed. 93 on Metacritics and 92% on Rotten Tomatoes is quite excellent.
user1: It certainly is. I appreciate that there are positive and negative reviews in the document
user2: Yes, it is great to see a variety of opinions.
user1: Do you know what CinemaScope is?
user2: I don't, what is it?
user2: Do you usually like musicals?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hello
user1: I have seen this film. Even though I don't usually go for musicals this one was pretty good. Looks like it is rated pretty well on the various sites too.
user2: i also saw the movie and i had bigger expectations when i saw the cast
user1: It says it was shot in "CinemaScope", I wonder what that is
user2: i don't either but at least the idea of the movie was great 
user1: The last couple reviews are a bit harsh, but I can kinda agree.
user1: It is a little difficult to not bring outside information into this conversation. 
user2: yea but it's a jazz movie after jazz became unpopular so it's kinda realistic
user1: True
user1: isn't this thing supposed to give us more info to chat about as we go?
user2: yea 
user1: Who is your favorite actor/actress in this film?
user2: they kind of boat are they have a good chemistry
user1: Ya, that is probably what made the film a hit. Speaking of chemistry, new info finally popped up about when they first sorta hit if of
user1: off
user1: These descriptions kinda make Sebastian sound like an ass with a real chip on his shoulder
user2: yea 
user1: Do you generally watch musicals?
user2: no i saw only too musicals
user2: thisone and Les Miserables
user1: I have seen a couple more
user1: Sound of Music (in school), and can' remember the others for the life of me
user1: What a pill, to be successful but not doing what you love
user2: i tried to watch some musicals but i felt asleap
user1: I think in reality he could have simply channeled the bands' success into a side project or been more forceful about fusing his own style into the bands' music.
user1: My problem with musicals is I zone out and don't listen to they lyrics.
user1: Which kinda make up a little bit of the story.
user2: that's kind of true 
user1: whoo hoo! another paragraph of info
user2: they were both extra sensitive
user1: Sheesh, I forgot about this part. He is the one who encouraged her and then left her hanging.
user1: Yes, they totally were!
user2: but he had a career and they were grownups not 16 yo teens
user1: Probably best they split, odds are at least one of them would of wound up a depressed pill popping alcoholic .
user1: Still though, she wasn't completely in the wrong. That was the main focus of her life for how long? And he forgot about it
user2: yea he was an ashole there
user1: all worked out in the end at least
user2: i think it's kind of what if situation for them 
user1: also a little dose or reality, relationships are tough and can suck sometimes
user2: yea they shouldn't be so overdramatick
user1: wait, her name was Mia Dolan. what a crappy name
user1: is that what she used for her stage name in the film?
user2: yea mia and sebastian
user1: terrible names
user1: I am starting to think this hit is a little broken
user2: me too
user2: in the rules it sais that after 3 times we talk a new paragraph loads
user1: so ya, the last name Dolan  sounds dumb
user1: Ya, but it seems to lag a bit
user1: So, do you agree with the ratings this movie got?\
user2: i think so it's a decent movie
user1: I agree.
user1: Do you usually watch movies with only good ratings?
user2: i try to 
user2: but i saw like 70% of imdb top 250
user1: Me too, unless something is highly recommended by a friend.
user1: I think I am probably somewhere in that ball park as well
user1: I am going to click finish conversation and see what happens. We have certainly completed this hit by now.

user1: So their relationship suffers and she tells him they were both happier when they weren't successful.
user1: She breaks up with him when he misses her opening night.
user1: She ends up moving back home when her show fails.
user2: That's really sad. 
user1: Yes it is.
user2: But I guess that's how real relationships are.
user2: Not all are happy endings.
user1: That's right. And because it's a musical it can get emotional.
user2: I just might have to see it.
user2: Thanks and bye
user1: The "Old Hollywood" style is worth it to see.
user1: Bye

conversation:
user2: Hello, do you like musicals or romantic comedy?
user1: Hey! How are you? I do like them occasionally, although I can't say they're my favorites.
user1: Is the movie you have info about a musical or a rom com?
user2: Hey, I'm doing great, thanks. You? 
user1: Doing pretty well!
user2: Yes, the movie I have info on is a musical with a romantic comedy theme: La La Land. Have you seen it?
user1: No I haven't, but I heard a lot of good about it - obviously.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Yeah, I've seen it. It's a great movie that is lighthearted and very pleasurable to watch. The critics seem to all like the dreamlike quality of it.
user1: I know! It won a bunch of awards if I remember well.
user1: From the trailer I saw, it looked like it was very unrealistic in the way things looked. Is that correct?
user2: Yeah, it has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 92% and Metacritic score of 93, which are impressive
user1: Wow! Really impressive. And it almost won Best Movie at the Oscars.
user2: Yeah, I think they were trying to evoke the oldtimey musicals of the past, which is why it was shot in Cinemascope like those old masterpieces.
user1: Aahh... I see. That does explain the look of what I saw in the trailer. Everything looked fake, in a way.
user1: In a pretty way though...
user2: Yeah, the scene when Mia (Emma Stone) first meets Seb (Ryan Gosling) is very memorable, and it comes to a surprising and sbrupt end.
user1: Now you're making me curious :-)
user2: Do you like the actors involved? Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, and John Legend all star in it.
user1: I do! I like all three of them. Although I know John Legend more as a musician than an actor.
user2: Legend plays Seb's former classmate Keith, who invites the struggling musician to play keyboards in his jazz fusion band where he would get a steady income. 
user2: This causes a conflict between Seb and Mia.
user1: Ha ha, conflict! You can't have a romantic movie without some problem between the love birds.
user1: Is it very romantic? Like extra sugary, or is there some bite to it?
user1: Maybe I'm asking questions you can't answer though, because of the rules of the HIT...
user2: It is a drama as well, so there is some tension in there. One critic referred to it as having a quality of "bittersweet happiness"
user1: Bittersweet... That could qualify as not being too sweet I guess.
user1: Cause I'm not crazy about romantic movies unless there is something crazy, or funny about them.
user1: Otherwise I find it really too much.
user1: I bet the movie ends well though...
user2: When Mia goes to see Seb on tour, that's when things get really interesting. She accuses him of abandoning his dreams and he misses out on Mia's play. Typical romcom misunderstanding ensues.
user1: I see... How is the humor in the movie?
user2: I would say lighhearted.
user2: Seb apologizes to Mia for missing the play, but she moves back home to her parents house.
user1: Lighthearted doesn't sound bad. And I can see Gosling and Stone doing that sort of thing.
user1: It does sound like the screenplay is really classic rom com.
user2: Based on the info so far, do you think you would watch this film?
user1: I think you helped me make up my mind about whether I would see it or not. Thanks!
user2: You're welcome.

conversation:
user1: Seen any good movies lately?
user2: Oh yeah. I watched La La Land again the other night. Have you seen it?
user1: I have seen the ads for that, it looks great!
user1: What did you think
user2: It's really good! Damien Chazelle directed it, and he's one of my favorite directors. Always puts a real jazzy theme in his movies, not to mention Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone doing wonderfully as their characters.
user2: It's really a pretty movie too.
user1: I love Chazelle's work! He is brilliant
user1: And who can pass on a Ryan Gosling movie?
user1: lol
user2: Truth!! And look, I know all that stuff at the Oscar's was wild, but it really is a good movie.
user1: What is the basic plot line? I can't get a good feel for it from the ads
user1: Nevermind the crazy Oscar drama!
user1: lol
user2: Well, the two main characters meet in Los Angeles while their both in a point in their lives where they're trying to make their dreams happen. They kind of bond over jazz, and fall in love in an extraordinary fashion.
user1: Wow! The timing sounds amazing! Two people chasing the same dream not only meet but fall in love!
user1: Did they perform together?
user2: They do! It's a romcom/musical so they do a lot of candid singing together, but in the plot of the movie they never performed on stage with each other.
user1: Wasn't a let down to not see them perform together?
user2: Yeah, it ended up being a pretty bitter-sweet thing. No spoilers though!
user1: Ok, you are keeping me intrigued...
user1: Did it win any awards? 
user2: I'm not sure off of the top of my head, you'd have to look it  up, but it definitely deserved one in my eyes!
user1: The Oscars don't always get it right in my opinion. If it were up to you, what award(s) would you give it? 
user2: Hmmm
user2: Probably best visual effects!
user2: It was REALLY beautiful!
user1: Ok, ok, you have me completely sold! I'm going to check it out this weekend!

conversation:
user1: I really think that musicals are fun to watch.
user2: So do I. Especially musicals that have a comedy aspect to them. 
user1: Do you think that Ryan Gosling is a good choice for the pianist role?
user1: I think that romantic comedies are the best.
user2: I believe so. He's charismatic and has a personality that makes him seem like he could pull of the pianist role.
user2: Do you think Emma Stone is a good choice for being an inspiring actress?
user1: I think she's the perfect choice but I didn't know she could sing.
user2: Neither did I. Do you agree with the ratings of the movie?
user1: I think that I do but I haven't seen the movie so it's hard to say.
user1: Aren't we supposed to be moved on ????
user2: I think so. Maybe after a certain number of responses. I think both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were good choices for a romantic movie. Don't you agree?
user1: I do agree.  They seem to be a perfect couple for this movie.  I guess Gosling is a musician in reality but who knows?
user2: Yeah. I'm not sure if he really fits jazz though. It doesn't seem like his genre.
user2: I think the scene with him disregarding the setlist and brushing Mia off is appropriate for his personality as he seems like someone who would be a bit full of himself, not caring about the rules or what other people think.
user1: Gosling's character seems to be trying to ignore the overtures of Mia and making himself "hard to get".
user2: Yeah, I didn't see it that way at first. 
user1: I only know what I'm reading about it and it seems like he really takes his time warming up to her.
user2: Yeah. I think it's a smart decision on the director's part though because the audience wants them to be together. Taking so long keeps them on their toes and makes them want to keep watching to see if they do end up together.
user1: That sounds exactly right.  But now I see that they moved in together.
user2: It seems like they started by portraying him as someone full of himself, then reveal his true character further in, like when he takes the gig to make Mia happy, even though he's not happy himself.
user1: Yes, they both appear to have concern for each other.  He encouraged Mia to write the play and she's upset that he's not happy with his new gig.
user2: It really shows how much they belong together. 
user1: I'm wondering how they ever get to be successful and happy about what they're doing.
user1: She accuses him of abandoning his dreams but he did it for her.
user2: I'm surprised that Mia's play turns out to be a disaster. She probably blames him since he encouraged her to do it in the first place, and that's probably a part of why she is unwilling to forgive him.
user1: It probably bothered her quite a bit that he didn't show up for it.
user2: Yeah, probably. This fight was a good idea to keep audiences wanting them together.
user1: She had to move back home because she couldn't pay the theater back.
user2: After her moving back home, you wonder if/how they'll get back together.
user1: I know--I guess we'll find out in the next paragraph.
user1: It doesn't appear to be an easy "happy ending".
user2: I agree. So far, it seems like a couple of the critics are wrong about the movie. It doesn't seem like it's dull at all.
user2: Although, I normally picture musicals being different. Normally the whole cast breaks into song and dance.
user1: Yes. it seems as if there isn't too much of that.
user1: Where is the 4th paragraph??
user2: II don't see much of the comedy aspect either, 
user2: I'm not sure.*
user1: No, I don't see very much to laugh about so far.
user2: Not by these scenes at least.
user1:  this is getting frustrating.
user2: The last one makes me wonder if Sebastian is going to chase after her or if they're going to run into each other again.
user1: The finish conversation button is available--do you have it as well?
user2: Yes. Does that mean we can exit? The top of the page does say it's the end of the document. 
user1: I guess we can finish--thank you for the back and forth.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: what movie are we talking about?
user2: We're talking about Inception
user2: Oh, sorry, it picked la la land
user1: have you seen the  movie?
user1: I heard it has many songs
user2: Not really, it's the first time I hear about it haha.
user2: Well it's a musical so it probably must have a lot of songs in it.
user2: Like you know, maybe High School Musical or something.
user2: Do you like this kind of movies?You'd give it a try?There's Emma Stone in there :D
user1: I enjoy it if I am familiar with the songs and the artists
user1: This movie seems interesting because of its actors
user1: I like both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: Actually I only know these two
user1: I hear it is pretty long
user2: Nope, not yet.
user1: I would like to see it ob DVD, so that way i can fast forward parts I don't enjoy
user2: Well it is said it gets pretty boring in the middle so DVD could be a good idea.
user2: I don't like to watch boring movies, you know.
user1: some of my friends saw it and said the same thing
user2: But, because of Emma Stone I could try
user1: So, it is kind of discouraging, but like you said the actors make me want to watch it
user1: I wonder if it is purely a romantic story
user1: I think it received several Oscar nominations last year
user2: It could be, I mean.. The jazz pianist and actress.Strange mix, but it sounds fun.
user2: Well it gots 92% in rotten tomatoes
user2: Got*
user1: that is a pretty high rating
user1: But most times these sites are very biased, so can't really rely on them
user2: Like most of these sites , really
user1: If they want to push a movie, they always give good reviews
user2: So, the movie is all about romance and music mixed together.But it doesn't look like a happy ender.
user1: So, how soon do you plant to watch this movie?
user1: Maybe not knowing the ending might entice me to watch it after all
user2: Well, I'll check the trailers then I'll decide.Maybe next week once I get some time.
user2: Though I don't think I'd like to watch it alone.
user1: maybe gather some friends and watch it when the weather is bad and you can't go out

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hi there
user1: Have you seen La La Land?
user1: Do you like musicals?
user2: not really
user2: but I like funny movies
user1: I wanted to see this movie because I like Ryan Gosling
user2: is it comedy movie or not?
user1: It does mention comedy drama
user1: I know there are a lot of songs
user2: Hmmm, it will be great then
user1: Emma Stone has done a great job too
user1: It won many Oscars last year
user2: Really?
user1: Or at least it was nominated
user2: owh
user1: I think there was a mix up in the announcement of best film last year
user1: The overall ratings are pretty good
user2: so have you watch that movie before?
user1: No, I wanted to but couldn't find the time
user1: Maybe will watch it on DVD now
user2: I want to watch it too
user1: Do you like the actors?
user2: can we watch it on netflix or somewhere online premium site?
user1: It would be a good mix of romance, music and comedy
user1: I'm sure it's available 
user2: I don't really know the actors :D
user2: but if it is comedic, it will work for me :D
user1: the problem is that it's pretty long in duration
user2: So I guess I will watch it on netflix
user2: How long?
user1: some reviews suggests that the middle part sags a bit
user2: Hmmm
user1: it can become boring then

conversation:
user2: I have not actually seen this movie, have you?
user1: No.  I'm not generally into romantic comedies, either, and the reviews don't seem that inspiring.
user2: I know what you mean, I am guy... I am not going to watch a chick flick/musical.
user1: Seems like a bunch of sentimental nonsense.
user2: Exactly, even my wife thought it looked stupid. Luckily, she is not roped into these types of movies - I would be miserable.
user1: Yeah, I'm glad my girlfriend doesn't pressure me to watch things like this.  "sags badly in the middle, like a worn-out mattress," that review got some laughs from me.
user2: Yep, that one is pretty graphic.
user2: You can totally understand where the critic is going...
user1: The one about the leads' lack of singing / dancing ability was pretty informative too.  In a movie like this, it seems like these would be the only important factors, and if they're lacking, what's the poing?
user1: ^point
user2: Indeed, if the leads are incapable of performing the basics of their roles, why are they in the movie?
user2: oh, wait, I know why... Rom/com, women dig Gosling, for whatever reason...
user1: Heard the name, can't put a face to it.
user2: Just your typical white bread male actor who is always doing these movies... I think he did The Notebook, another infamous film of this type.
user1: Ah, well, if he's in movies like this, I would probably not have seen him.
user2: Exactly
user2: This scene that just got added at the bottom just sounds awful...
user1: Looking over the "Key Scene 1" synopsis now.  I suppose a jazz improvisation is a bit of an improvement over Christmas music.  Still, the scene seems rather stilted and artificial.  It doesn't seem like this sort of thing would happen in real life.
user1: Yeah.  Are people who write this even human?
user2: Great minds think alike, I guess. I believe that they are 'human', just have horrible tastes
user2: White guy playing jazz is too much of a stretch for me
user1: The responses of the characters just seem so unnatural.
user2: Like you said, artificial.
user2: I would even say, forced, in a way.
user1: Well, I've seen white guys who were into jazz, but someone insisting on traditional Christmas music?  And firing a musician just because he decided to play a bit of jazz?  And then all the other stuff that follows?  It does not seem very believable.
user1: Let's see, left hand side updated again.  It seems there are more awful scenes to look at.
user2: Her play flopped
user2: Go figure
user2: And let the crying commence...
user1: Yeah.  More sentimental nonsense.
user2: You got that right
user2: I am going to need to eat a rare steak to offset all of this estrogen.
user1: It would be hilarious if someone made an adaptation of this that was about a death metal band.
user2: You know, that could work
user2: Anything would be better than -this-

conversation:
user2: What rating does this movie have?
user2: you there?
user1: Hello?
user1: Are you there?
user1: The rating is around 8.6 on rotten tomatoes
user1: I hope to be able to see it someday
user1: Umm.. okay.. I was reading the document.  I was supposed to be allowed to read for 5 minutes.. before I actually ended up chatting.  I read.. about LA LA LA land and then I didn't notice someone was already chatting.  I waited five minutes.. I thought maybe your system would send another.. I waited for another page to be sent.. neither thing happened so I am aborting conversation and asking to be paid.. If you have a user this weekend at a specific time, just email me and I'll come back again for free

conversation:
user1: Hey have you seen La LA Land? 
user2: yes, I have
user2: do you like musicals?
user1: Oh really,  I haven't seen it.  I am not sure though if I would like it is it good? 
user1: Lol auto correct and not really but I heard it was good
user2: It was very entertaining if you like romantic comedies
user2: but I don't think I'd watch it again
user2: overrated
user2: it's definitely slow at timesa
user2: re you planning on watching it at all?
user1: I do like romantic comedies but not musicals.  And I might if it's on cable one day. 
user2: haha, yeah, I hear ya
user1: I do like Emma Stone,  I think she's a great actress. 
user2: I like her also
user2: the musical parts were good scenes
user1: Yeah.  Do you like Ryan Gosling? 
user2: umm, yeah! I actually do
user2: I like him a little more after watching this even though it wasn't the best film
user2: do you like him?
user1: I don't think I have seen him in many movies,  but I'm sure he's good. 
user2: He is super into jazz in the movie and plays piano and sings
user2: what types of movies do you usually watch?
user1: Action,  drama,  mystery, comedy.  What about you? 
user2: drama, comedy, documentary
user2: some sci -fia
user2: just not horror
user1: I like horror and thriller just nothing gory,  yuck!  Haha
user2: well, la la land is definitely not gory
user2: haha
user1: I feel like it got hyped too much.
user1: Wow the critics scores are high. 
user2: yeah, it did. non exceptional singing
user1: They sing bad? 
user2: not bad per se, just not amazing
user2: it's entertaining at most
user2: wow, the critics did give them high scores!
user1: I think the only musical I liked were the high school musicals on Disney lol.  
user2: haha, I have never watched those
user2: this one has a bad storyline. the guy gets successful and she likes him less
user2: and ends up leaving him
user1: Wow, how could you not like someone when they more successful? Was it going to his head? 
user2: I think so. he got his priorities mixed up
user2: I think i started spacing out at this point, but according to this article he missed her play
user1: Well nice talking to you.  :) I might watch it. 
user2: okay :)

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: hello!
user2: How are you?
user1: I'm good! How about you?
user2: I'm great, thanks!
user1: I haven't seen La La Land, but apparently it's some jazz movie. 
user2: I haven't either. I have heard good things about it!
user1: I'm not really into romantic comedies, so I don't think I would be interested in this movie. 
user1: Oh wait, it's romantic comedy drama. Eesh. Ok
user2: I heard it is a musical, too
user2: That both Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds sing in it?
user2: Not really my style or thing.
user1: Me either. I like movies where people pursue dreams and all but this sounds like too much.
user2: I think it's kind of pandering to the Hollywood elite. I like inspirational movies, sure, but this is combining too much of the things I don't really like.
user1: I mean it got a really good Rotten Tomato score, I just don't think I would be interested in it
user2: Many of my friends have seen it and recommended it to me, but I didn't really think it was for me.
user1: I'm not really the melodramatic type, nor do I like fizzy fantasy movies
user2: I prefer action or thriller or horror...which this has none of
user2: How long is this movie, anyway? Two hours? Two and a half?
user1: I love horror movies! And I don't want to judge something I haven't seen, but reading about it just makes it sound so uninteresting. 
user2: I am trying to find a redeeming quality or something that would make me WANT to watch this.
user2: I can't seem to find much. Maybe Ryan Reynolds?
user1: I'm not sure how long it is, but apparently it had 1980's pop music, which is kind of weird considering this is supposed to be about Jazz
user2: or Ryan Gosling
user2: or whoever it is
user2: That is very strange. Why incorporate that style of music into the movie about Jazz. That seems....like it doesn't fit.
user2: Baz Luhrmann can do that (Moulin Rouge!) but I don't see it working for anyone else
user1: lol, yeah. I know it got a really good rating, but this movie sounds bad. 
user2: I just am not sure how I could watch this movie
user1: At least the cast is good. Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone, but I don't think they're enough to get me to watch this movie. 
user2: Right
user2: I wonder about the music
user2: If the actual songs were songs from the 80s that I like...it might help
user1: IT looks like it has a variety of music, Summer Montage, and A Lovely Night. I just hope they don't sing all the time
user2: That would be interesting to know - the singing to speaking ratio
user2: I wouldn't want to get duped into watching a fully no-speaking-at-all musical
user1: That would be horrible. Outside of that it looks like the standard boy meets girl falls in love type of stuff that I really can't stand. I do not like romantic comedies, lol!

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: Hi, I think you should watch LaLa Land. It sounds like it is an amazing movie
user2: Who stars in the movie?
user1: Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend
user2: I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?
user1: Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.
user2: I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.
user2: Where does the movie take place?
user1: He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles. 
user2: Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?
user1: She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams. 
user2: What part does John Legend play?
user1: I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician
user2: What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?
user1: Yes I think it is modern time period
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship
user2: Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.
user1: Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.
user2: Do you know what the play is about?
user1: No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in 
user2: Is there alot of dancing also?
user1: I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical
user2: I do too, if it is done well.
user2: Does Emma Stone sing as well?
user1: When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful
user2: That doesn't bode well for the relationship.
user1: I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!
user2: Does he go with her to Nevada?
user1: No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust
user2: It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.
user1: John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!
user2: I bet you are right.
user1: I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it. 
user2: Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.
user1: I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film. 
user2: Sounds great.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hello, are you into musicals?
user2: yeah, I do like them
user1: then have you seen La La Land?
user2: No, I havent seen that movie, is it good
user1: yes, really good, it has 92% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Oh, thats a pretty good score!
user2: what  about other ratings?
user1: Metacritics is 93/100 
user1: and IMBD is over 8...pretty sepctacular these days
user2: Yeah, it must be, you dont see movies with those ratings any more
user2: what about the cast of the movie?
user1: Ryan Gosling and Emma stone are in it
user1: and John Legend too
user2: I love how they act, do you like them?
user1: very much
user2: what was your favorite scene of the movie
user1: the restaurant scene  when Sebastian (ryan Gosling) is fired for playing his music and not the one he is told to play
user2: sounds like an interesting scene
user2: what about another
user1: The one when Sebastian feels compelled to sign a contract as a keyboardist because he heard Mya speak to her mother about how he was working on his career
user2: Ok, and can you tell me a bit more about the movie
user2: what about critic responses?
user1: pretty positive reviews, they say it is just as much about the dream world we want to live in and the cruel realty of how to achieve them
user2: sounds really interesting, good critics 
user1: mostly very positive, some though say the movie sags a bit in the middle
user1: but very entertaining
user2: Oh I see, well most people dont like musicals
user2: its stragne that a musical has good ratings and critic responses
user2: do you like musicals
user1: I think there are other elements to it: romance, comedy melodrama
user1: yes I very much like musicals
user2: oh I see, I think I will watch it
user2: it seems like a good movie with different elements on it
user2: Im going to give it a shot
user1: great! I convinced you then. I'm glad

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hello
user2: The movie I'm going to be talking about is LaLa Land.
user1: Oh, okay, what type of movie is it?
user2: It is a musical, drama, romance film. 
user1: That sounds fun! Who is in it?
user2: It stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It also features John Legend and Callie Hernandez.
user1: I have no clue who Callie Hernande is  but I like Emma stone and Ryan gosling a lot.
user1: Lol, sorry Ryan... that is
user2: It has pretty good reviews too. It has a 92 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 93/100
user1: Wow that is impressive, did they win any awards?
user2: I'm not entirely sure.
user1: Have you seen it?
user1: hello?
user2: Yes. In it Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist and Emma Stone is an aspiring actress. They meet and fall in love while in Los Angeles pursuing their dreams.
user1: Did you like it?
user2: The critical response has been very positive. Some have called it an intimate masterpiece and the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment. 
user1: Well I guess other people certainly liked it.
user1: Do you know who choreographed the dance numbers?
user1: Was it mandy moore?
user2: Indeed. The story kicks off when Sebastian (that's Ryan Gosling) performing a passionate jazz improvisation despite the owner of the restaurant he's working at demanding only traditional christmas songs
user1: I like jazz and christmas music.
user2: Mia (Emma Stone) overhears Sebastian's improvisation and is moved by it. 
user1: And Emma plays an actress, is that right?
user2: Yes, she plays an aspiring actress.

conversation:
user2: So..how did you like the movie?
user1: Loved it actually.
user1: How about you?
user2: I liked the beginning but I started out spacing out halfway through. Did you find Ryan Gosling believable as a jazz pianist?
user1: Actually yes lol 
user2: How about Emma Stone?
user1: Hey! I was just about to ask you about her!
user1: They are both super talented people 
user2: I think they make a good pair on film. They have great chemistry.
user1: What about John Legend though? We know he has talent. Honestly i think Ryan Gosling makes  a perfect jazz pianist. lol
user1: Oh yes they do! 
user1: So why did you space out HALF way through?
user2: John Legend really has talent. 
user2: I was a little bit tired from all the song and dance. It did not bother you?
user1: I am not the biggest fan of musicals.. However.. Some i can handle...
user2: I get you. I thought it was a bit too....boy meets girl...boy loses girl...and we all know how this turns out
user1: The story of life lol
user2: Did you think that it deserved oscars?
user1: Maybe for the people IN the movie. The actor's.. But not so sure about the actual movie.
user1: How about you?
user1: nevermind, im gonna assume you dont haha  because you were already done before it began 
user2: I think that Emma Stone is really likable, on screen and off, and it may be why she gets nominated so often
user1: That's true. She really is talented. But.. So is Ryan Gosling.
user2: He really is also. I thought the story was a bit too predictable.
user1: Honestly most of the movies i watch any more are. Just like you said about boy meets girl... It always seems to be the same stories every time.
user2: You said it...the movies really predictable. Like when he joins a jazz band...really? Who has a jazz band anymore&
user1: LOL!!! Not me anyway
user1: So do you normally watch MUSICALS? 
user2: Rarely....I usually fall asleep in spite of the music! 
user1: I was wondering how that works for ya lol the music should keep you from yawning.
user2: How did you like near the end of the movie where they argue about him losing his principles? Didn't you think that was a bit cliché?
user1: Didnt really like it much. Very cliche. Seem's to be something that happens at the end of every movie genre like this
user2: Exactly....maybe they want to make a sequel? With chemistry like those two, you try to do more.
user1: Well i wouldnt mind a second one.. Maybe it will end differently this time.

conversation:

user1: It got some excellent rating. a 92% on rotton tomatoes, and a 8.1/10 on IMDB
user2: whats the rating of the movie
user2: wow
user1: It's not your average love story. the two meet after emma stone overhears a song that ryan gosling is playing, but months later they run into each other at a party. The two act like they do not like each other, despite the chemistry between them

user2: That's good
user1: Then the band goes on tour and this causes an argument with the couple. The girl has a play and it is bad. Things aren't going well all around. The girl moves back home.

user2: I might have to look later , or maybe netflix

user1: it says finish conversation so. 
user2: thanks

conversation:
user1: good afternoon
user2: good afternoon, hows it going?
user1: great, you?

conversation:
user1: hey 
user2: hey
user1: i just watched la la land. It is a movie from 2016 starring ryan gosling and emma stone. they are too artists (one actress and one panist) and they fall in love and try to achieve their dreams.
user1: its a great movie 
user2: It's a wonderful movie and got a score of 92% on rotten tomatoes
user1: yes, i think it also won an oscar
user2: Yes but I thought it was a little dull
user1: metacritics rating is 93/100 as well
user1: its pretty critically acclaimed
user2: the two leads singing and dancing weren't exceptional
user1: i suppose it is not for everyone
user2: It also sags badly in the middle 
user2: I like how Sebastian slipped into a passionate jazz despite warnings from the owner.
user1: what do you think of the cover of "i ran so far away?" 
user1: in the movie, sebastian found the song an insult for a serious musician
user2: I don't know, it is considered an insult for serious musicians
user2: not sure why
user1: yeah
user2: The idea of a one woman play was daring
user1: it was interesting how sebastian joined a jazz fusion band
user1: he couldnt find real happiness in any of the bands he was in
user1: its hard 
user2: It is considering she didn't know of any of that
user2: until she attended one of his concerts
user1: yeah, that is daring 
user1: the movie kind of speaks to a lot of people. 
user1: she accussed him of abandoning his dreams 
user1: but sometimes thats what you have to do. 
user2: Not nice that she leaves because he told her she liked him better when he was unsuccessful
user2: The play was a disaster so he didn't miss anything when he missed it. 
user1: yeah, but i dont blame her for dumping him for that 
user2: She should didn't want to support him and she had to move back
user1: id be pretty upset as well
user1: to boulder city
user1: nevada
user2: yes she didn't want to forgive him, I didn't understand that
user1: well because that was a big deal to her and he missed it
user2: if she was with him when he was unsuccessful, she could have supported him to follow his dreams
user2: or other dreams
user1: i suppose that is true
user2: she wasn't successful either
user1: yeah she wasnt
user1: nobody showed up
user1: to her play
user2: so why the big hulabaloo about him
user1: not sure
user2: she was selfish I guess
user2: He missed her play because he had to go for a photo shoot with the band that he had previously missed
user1: yeah but he should have kept better track
user1: and scheduled it better
user2: this shows that he was trying to commit some and follow his dreams although not necessarily like them
user2: so she would be please if he didn't attend the photo shoot a second time, and came to her show
user1: i definitely felt bad for both of them though in that scene
user2: it's more of a do or don't he is still condemned
user2: I feel bad for him because he tried
user2: he tried to get her back by apologizing as well
user2: she didn't want any of it
user1: yeah because she felt like he didnt care enough because he missed it
user1: he's the one that suggested the one woman play
user2: They could have started all over again just like the beginning
user1: maybe so
user2: did she fail because of the one-woman play?
user2: she could have tried something else if she felt that
user1: she wanted to give it a shot
user2: she did and it failed, he did and it failed
user2: they just had to compromise
user2: so they could be together again, which was how the happiness was 
user2: He signed up for the band after hearing her talking to her mom about how he is working on his career
user2: I think he did a lot for her

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: hello
user1: Hello!
user2:  do you like this movie
user1: The movie is called La La Land. Have you seen it?
user1: Yes I like the movie. I saw it in the theater 
user2: i like  yes i have seen
user2: how thet charactor
user1: I liked how Ryan Gosling played Sebastian Wilder
user2: yes i like him
user1: It got great ratings
user2: yes it will be siseare
user1: Sebastian was a very innovative character
user2:  sorry intersting story
user2: still i have to watch more time it is not bouring
user2: are you there bro?
user2: bye
user1: I found it interesting that when Mia runs into Sebastian the she picks the song I Ran (So Far Away)
user2: yes i also intersted
user2: can we finish talk
user1: The film was made in 2016 and I thought it was very progressive. How about you?
user2: i also happy
user2:  nice to talk to you
user1: Mia was a great character with determination 
user1: Very romantic when Mia moves in to live with Sebastian
user2: yes  i will sebastian
user1: Sebastian was also very determined to bring in a steady income.
user1: Sebastian's band was successful!
user1: But I know that he did not like the music that Keith's band played.
user2: yes  i was band play
user2: i like the music
user1: When the band  starts their tour I found it interesting that Mia accuses Sebastian of abandoning hie dreams!
user2: the dreams was sebastian
user2: tthe band  starts like it
user1: Mia's play was sad, in that was a disaster and Sebastian miss the play due to a band photo shoot! 
user2: yes i was the photo
user1: The total movie was very entertaining!

conversation:
user2: I really liked la la land its a musical which i do enjoy
user2: I think emma stone was fantastic in this movie hearing her range in vocals and her musical steps she was amazing
user1: Yes, it is a well crafted film with excellent dance numbers in it
user2: their romance in the film gets a little stale for a bit but it gets back on track and really hums at the end
user1: Emma Stone did do well in the film but I don't think she is an exceptional singer
user2: She really isnt thats why it kind of shocked me to hear her hit some notes 
user1: The film wasn't perfect but it was visually stunning
user2: Yes the visuals were amazing clear crisp the colors jumped off the page it seemed!
user1: I did not find Ryan Goslings character all that interesting. Emma Stone did a better job at grabbing my attention
user2: Exactly i dont dont know if he was told to act a little dull but he wasnt looking into it to me just eh ok in his performance i would say
user1: Although the film had a lot going for it I don't it is really all that good. There are better films
user2: I agree with you I think it was a little overhyped hoping people would be nostalgic about those types of films but it could of been better i agree totally 
user1: It doesn't really make sense that a white male is apparently the only one capable of reviving Jazz, which was traditionally black music.
user2: or how he just so happens to be more passionate about the culture than the people who created it was a little of a stretch
user1: exactly. The film would have made more sense if the cast a black lead
user2: another thing as a child of the 80's dissing 80's pop was not a good moment for those of a certain age like dude i liked that I ran song lol
user1: lol. true. true. Ryan Goslings character wasn't very likable in general tbh.
user2: overall i would give it maybe a 6 out of 10 only because of the visuals and  few dance scenes 
user1: same. The visuals were the best part of the movie. Other movies did a far better job with their story telling
user2: It seems like this movie came out a lot earlier than 2016 mainly because it was so eh bland but the critical respones from a lot of critics hyped it up to be all that. It did win a few awards so eh i guess
user2: looking at the rotten tomatoes rating of 92% seems a little high to me whew
user1: yeah. I think the critics liked it because it is a Hollywood movie that talks about why Hollywood is so great.
user1: It definitely did not diserve to be nominated for so many awards
user2: exactly thats a little why to this day when they laud some movie with saying how great it is i remain reserved to see it
user1: Yeah. That's also why I rely on the audience as well as the critics. Some times the critics just don't know a good movie when they see one and they over hype a bad one.
user2: like at least one critic commented is a jazz snob lol i think that comes across loud and clear lol
user1: exactly. critics need to think more critically about the movies they are watching
user2: have you watched anything else with gosiling in it that you enjoyed
user1: The notebook was good
user1: I think he did a better preformance in that then in la la land
user1: but I think that partly has to do with the director
user2: I agree the storyline and plot to la la land limited his acting chops alot

conversation:
user1: I will go to the movies this weekend. Do you have any suggestions of what I might see?
user2: If you like romantic comedies or musicals, La La Land combines both! 
user2: It features Ryan Gosling and Emma stone too. 
user2: Do you like those types of movies?

conversation:
user1: Hey! Would you say you are a fan of musicals?
user2: No, not really.
user1: Well there's always an exception and the movie La La Land may be that one!

conversation:
user2: Ryan Gosling was a good choice for Sebastian Wilder, do you agree?
user1: Hi, how are you?
user1: I never saw that movie. How was it rated?
user2: The ratings where pretty high, 8.1/10
user2: For a musical it has a pretty good story behind it
user1: What rating system was it? iMBD, Rotten Tomatoes?
user1: Oh yeah, it was a musical?
user2: IMDB gave it 8.1/10, Rotten Tomatoes 92%
user1: Is that the only movie you had to review?
user1: Were you given the % of how many people liked it?
user2: Yes, La La Land is great, you should watch it
user1: I heard about it. How were the ratings on that?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes 92% and average reviews where around 8.6/10
user1: What genre is it? I never watched it.
user1: I'm not a huge fan of movies unfortunately so that is why
user2: The story is about a man named Sebastian who is passionate about Jazz, and he meets a woman who is entranced by his talent
user2: It is a Musical, Drama and Romance
user1: Is there any comedy involved in it?
user2: The movie makes good use of comedy, I would describe it best as a romantic comedy
user1: Who stars in La La Land?
user2: Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, Emma Stone as Mia (The two main characters) and then John Legend and Callie Hernandez
user2: Ryan and Emma are suprisingly good singers, you would never expect it
user1: Oh Sebastian Wilder is the character in La La Land, not a separate movie. Gotcha. I was confused for a second.
user1: That's interesting. Emma Stone being a great singer is awesome!
user1: For someone who hasn't watched it, why would you recommend it to me?
user2: Well, it is considered the "year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment", so of course I would recomend it to anyone
user2: It is a great piece of writing with a excellently written story and has a great cast
user1: I'm interested. Is there a movie that you could compare it to?
user2: I think it is hard to compare it to another movie, it really is unique, but if I had to choose I would say it is almost a modern-day Grease
user1: I've heard about Grease but never seen it. But I've always wanted to watch it so I'll definitely give La La Land a try!
user2: Of course! It is definitely something you should watch at least once, especially to see Emma Stone singing
user2: Do you like musicals?
user1: The only musical movie I've seen is High School Musical about 15 years ago when I was babysitting haha
user1: But I'm open to them. Why?
user2: High School Musical? I couldn't relate La La Land with it, they are drastically different
user2: I am not a fan of Musicals so much, but La La Land is a good movie from 2016
user2: Do you generally watch movies with good/bad ratings?

conversation:
user1: Hi; I'm told you've been reading about a movie.  What's the name of that movie?
user2: La la land. you into musicals?
user1: Yes, I like a lot of musicals actually.  Is La La Land a musical?
user2: yes it is but there is a plot to it which is opposite of a lot of musicals. I like music per se for concerts but when a musical movie comes out I am still on the fence about liking it. But this one is different mainly because of the characters in it
user1: To me most musicals have a plot of some sort; are you saying that this one doesn't have the usual sort of plot?  I like musicals because usually they're lighthearted and the characters are fun.  How are the characters in La La Land different from the norm?
user2: One of the main characters is Ryan Gosling and the other is Emma Stone. To me these are more drama actors but they seem to pull off this type of musical very good. I've never seen Gosling in a musical but this movie is worth watching because I like  to hear piano coupled with a jazz genre. 
user1: Oh awesome, I love that style!  I had no idea that both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone could sing.  Is the whole film done in a jazz genre?
user2: The jazz genre is the theme of the movie but this film is the never ending quest to make it big in Los Angeles. The two lead characters of course end up working together, fall in love and the movie shows their ups and downs within their lifestyle and personal lives. I think this movie comes out a little unrealistic but it allows us to dream a bit and enjoying the musical aspect of it
user1: What do you feel is unrealistic about it?  What kinds of ups and downs do they go through?  The theme is interesting; it's typical of anyone trying to make it in show business, and of course gives more fuel for songs.
user2: The unrealism stems from dance halls from the past that don't exist now except in the movie. It is entertaining though because of the musical aspect of it all. We can only imagine things happening that are within the movie with the struggling actors. As with any movie one has to like the actors to be able to enjoy the moments that seem to sag a little. This movie may give rise to the resurgence of musicals back into the movie mainstream. Do you think that might happen?
user1: So are the dance halls in the movie treated as though they really exist, or are they parts of a set the characters are working on while trying to make it big in LA?  Music does tie everything together, that is very true.  What kinds of struggles do they go through?  I think that musicals can make a comeback depending on the scenes, plot, and type of music.
user2: These dance halls are created for movie effects but they are the mainstay for the main characters trying to break into stardom within Hollywood. The struggles are related to the type of music that they like but getting the directions attention is another story altogether. Do you like it when musicals turn into some sort of dancing theme as well?
user1: Oh I see, so they are sort of the window onto the struggles the characters are having, with music and with their private lives, it seems.  I do enjoy musicals with dancing; I think it adds interest and liveliness.  Is there a lot of dancing in this film? And what types of dancing are there?
user2: There isn't as much dancing as there is singing within the film. It seems that the main characer is trying to save the genre of the music he loves from going away from popularity. That music is themed to the black musical genre that is so pedominant in the Southern States. Do you treasure movies with more emphasis on singng or dancing to make it enjoyable for you to watch?
user1: Does the film give a reason as to why the genre he loves is becoming less popular?  Is it because it is primarily only popular in that location in the US?  I like movies with singing or movies with dancing, or some combination of both, actually.  What kind of dancing is done in La La Land?
user2: Yeah the type of dancing that is done in the movie seems to be done only in a movie setting. In real life, well it's probably just not done but enjoyable to watch.There are moments within the movie where the main character talks about the dying art of the music that he loves but still supports it. Do you think that movies and real life musicals are still a fantasy?
user1: What kind of dancing is only done in a movie?  There are lots of genres of dancing that I've seen done in real life too, so I'm having a hard time picturing the style of dance in La La Land.  What art is dying?
user2: Since I don't dance at all it's hard for me to depict the type of dance that is in the movie. Whether it's in the movies or not, dancing is a foreign skill to me. I know that dances have style names to it but which ones I do not know. Are you versed in the different types of dancing? That is, do you enjoy dancing with different dance styles?
user1: I do enjoy different types of dance, yes.  I would venture to guess that the dance in this movie is jazz dancing maybe.  Is it described at all in any manner?  Is it fast dancing or slow dancing?  
user2: In my vernacular it would be considered Hollywood dancing. But all this is secondary to the main theme of trying to "make it" in Hollywood while romancing each other. A musical romance movie made for the masses. It sounds like your interest is piqued for this movie? Is it?
user1: Hollywood dancing is probably a combination of a bunch of styles.  I think my interest is piqued, yes, but I'm curious to know more about how they're trying to make it in show business.
user2: I think this is a movie where you would go in with no expectations except to be entertained. There is so much drama with the news these days that I think we all need a break from reality. We need just to enjoy some light hearted movie that is good to relax and fantasize a bit. Wouldn't you agree?
user1: I agree, that if it is a movie that's relaxing but has some good music and dancing, then it sounds like something I would enjoy, for sure.  What time period does the movie take place in?
user2: The movie depicts the most recent time period as in today's environment. Which is why it is a bit of a fantasy. But I think the lead actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can save the day with this movie by keeping this type of genre alive in the consumers quest for entertainment.
user1: Ah, which is why you think the dance halls didn't fit because they're way older in history.  I agree that they are both good actors, and I'm surprised to find them acting in a musical...pleasantly surprised.  Does the movie end happily ever after, so to speak?
user2: The movie ends only with the thought that good things can happen with the right attitude and chemistry between people. Keeping the dream alive with hope and inspiration can be tough but so very desirable. This is a movie where people will just want to lsiten to the music and forget the plot altogether. Do you watch movies over again just to watch the actors? I believe this type of movie with its musical aspects is that type of movie that needs repeating.
user1: I do watch movies over again if I want to see particular scenes for enjoyment or study.  So are you saying it's worth watching over again because of the music only, or because of the plot, or both?
user2: The movie would be worth waching because of the music. The never ending quest of maintaiining the type of music that the lead actor wants to keep alive is the main theme here. He is adamant and that shows through his passion for the music and it carrys over to his romancing of the other lead character within the movie.

conversation:
user1: Do you like musical movies?
user2: Hi, it depends on the musical but this one had a jazz pianist so I think having a musical with some jazz is really interesting. What do you think about the musical being tied with drama and romance?
user1: I think it gives the movie emotional depth.  However most musicals are tied to romance.  
user1: I noticed this movie has very good ratings.  When you watch a movie is that important for you?
user2: You're right, I think a lot of musicals are tied to romance or emotional depth. I think musicals are also tied to fantasy, since in real life people don't just start singing, so I think the idea that "La La Land" in part refers to being out of touch with reality goes well with a musical. 
user2: Ratings are not so important, because there are mixed ratings here... some say its pleasurable, another says it sags badly in the middle, so I like to form my own opinions.
user2: It has a 92% score on rotten tomatoes? Would you trust that rating?
user1: When I look at movies I have liked in the past and their rotten tomatoes score in caparison to their IMDB rating I usually agree more with IMDB ratings.  Looking at the cast, would you be more attracted to the movie based upon one or more of the cast them 
user1: *?
user2: I am not experienced with IMDB vs. Rotten tomatoes, but since I don't care much about ratings, yes, I would look at the cast and also the plot. I like Ryan Gosling, but I am not crazy about Emma stone. The plot though seems interesting enough to make up for that, I like that it's called a comedy-drama. Do you enjoy blended genres?
user2: Why would you agree more with the IMDB rating?
user1: I do enjoy blended genres.  I especially enjoy comedies, as well as dramas.  One of the critical responses says that this movie is the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment.  Given that the year of release was 2016 would you agree?

conversation:
user2: The movie is called La la Land, with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
user1: Ah, Ive heard a lot about this!
user2: It has 92 % rotten tomatoes
user1: Emma stone has a lead part i see, thats a great Tomatoes score!

user2: Yes, John Legend!
user2: Overall pretty good ratings.
user2: i think they won a bunch of awards too
user1: I like him, maybe ill watch it. I guess when someone says it "the years most seriously pleasurable entertainment" you have to take notice.
user1: can you relate to Sebastian when he sticks up for the music he loves? i bet i woul!
user2: I think I'll watch it later
user2: I definitely would too
user1: Slipping into a passionate jazz improvisation despite the warning to play christmas songs, I love it!
user2: Perfect love story
user1: oh, yeah? i like a good love story.
user1: write a one woman play, what a marvelous idea?
user1: a love afair based around music, whats not to like. 
user2: Aww and he did it because he wanted her to be happy
user1: and Mia try's to defend Sebastian to her mother, they must love each other
user1: callie hernandez as tracy, how did that go?
user2: I don't even know who that is
user2: And when does she come into play
user1: Im not sure when Calie comes in, Perhaps shes one of Sabastian's former classmates.
user1: Mia and sebation get into a augument on their firsrt tour? typical!
user1: Sounds like she's unwilling to forgive him.
user2: so typical
user2: but they'll find their way back
user1: Guess she moves back home to Boulder City, Nevada!
user1: Maybe not!
user1: I guess the play is a disaster and few people attend..
user2: The struggle
user1: people can be so dismissive.

conversation:
user2: Hello, do you like musicals or romantic comedy?
user1: Hey! How are you? I do like them occasionally, although I can't say they're my favorites.
user1: Is the movie you have info about a musical or a rom com?
user2: Hey, I'm doing great, thanks. You? 
user1: Doing pretty well!
user2: Yes, the movie I have info on is a musical with a romantic comedy theme: La La Land. Have you seen it?
user1: No I haven't, but I heard a lot of good about it - obviously.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Yeah, I've seen it. It's a great movie that is lighthearted and very pleasurable to watch. The critics seem to all like the dreamlike quality of it.
user1: I know! It won a bunch of awards if I remember well.
user1: From the trailer I saw, it looked like it was very unrealistic in the way things looked. Is that correct?
user2: Yeah, it has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 92% and Metacritic score of 93, which are impressive
user1: Wow! Really impressive. And it almost won Best Movie at the Oscars.
user2: Yeah, I think they were trying to evoke the oldtimey musicals of the past, which is why it was shot in Cinemascope like those old masterpieces.
user1: Aahh... I see. That does explain the look of what I saw in the trailer. Everything looked fake, in a way.
user1: In a pretty way though...
user2: Yeah, the scene when Mia (Emma Stone) first meets Seb (Ryan Gosling) is very memorable, and it comes to a surprising and sbrupt end.
user1: Now you're making me curious :-)
user2: Do you like the actors involved? Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, and John Legend all star in it.
user1: I do! I like all three of them. Although I know John Legend more as a musician than an actor.
user2: Legend plays Seb's former classmate Keith, who invites the struggling musician to play keyboards in his jazz fusion band where he would get a steady income. 
user2: This causes a conflict between Seb and Mia.
user1: Ha ha, conflict! You can't have a romantic movie without some problem between the love birds.
user1: Is it very romantic? Like extra sugary, or is there some bite to it?
user1: Maybe I'm asking questions you can't answer though, because of the rules of the HIT...
user2: It is a drama as well, so there is some tension in there. One critic referred to it as having a quality of "bittersweet happiness"
user1: Bittersweet... That could qualify as not being too sweet I guess.
user1: Cause I'm not crazy about romantic movies unless there is something crazy, or funny about them.
user1: Otherwise I find it really too much.
user1: I bet the movie ends well though...
user2: When Mia goes to see Seb on tour, that's when things get really interesting. She accuses him of abandoning his dreams and he misses out on Mia's play. Typical romcom misunderstanding ensues.
user1: I see... How is the humor in the movie?
user2: I would say lighhearted.
user2: Seb apologizes to Mia for missing the play, but she moves back home to her parents house.
user1: Lighthearted doesn't sound bad. And I can see Gosling and Stone doing that sort of thing.
user1: It does sound like the screenplay is really classic rom com.
user2: Based on the info so far, do you think you would watch this film?
user1: I think you helped me make up my mind about whether I would see it or not. Thanks!
user2: You're welcome.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: So hey I just watched a romantic-comedy movie that had a touch of drama about these two aspiring people who want to be a jazz pianist and aspiring actress. It had those two really popular actors ryan gosling and emma stone. have you seen it?  
user2: are u there?
user1: Yeah I'm here
user1: Oh, I forgot the add that the movie was called La La Land.
user2: oh nice
user2: I have heard of the movie but never watched it before
user1: Yeah, it's been given some pretty good critical responses. 
user2: The name lala land sounds funny..what do u think might have inspired such a hilarous name
user2: what's the worst ?
user1: A critic described it as  "fizzy fantasy and a hard- headed fable" think that speaks for why its called la la land
user1: The worst critic response? That the movie was dull, the leads singing and dancing aren't good and that Sebastian, Ryan Gosling character was a massive jazz snob and Mia, emma stones character has no depth.
user1: Would you watch a movie like this? It's a musical.
user2: wow and it still won awards!
user2: interesting
user2: I think so
user2: its not too harsh
user2: and it does not have blood
user2: and its musical

user2: what genre of movies do u like generally
user1: I tend to like musicals. I enjoyed this movies a lot.
user2: I will look watch it then :)
user2: any special scene that u like alot?
user1: Yes, there was a scene in the movie where Mia sees Sebastian at a party
user2: ok
user2: then what happened?
user1: I need to add that Mia has perviously meet sebastian a few months before she saw him at the party. She saw him playing jazz and when she went up to compliment him he simply brushed her off
user2: oh wow :)
user2: is the movie PG rated?
user1: so when Mia sees this jazz player suddenly playing in an 1980's cover pop band she teases him by requesting I Ran So far away a song he considered as insult for a serious musician.
user1: Actually I have no idea was rating the movie was
user1: Would a rating beyond PG not interest you in watching it?
user2: hahaha

user2: Hi, you should definitely check out Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone's Musical Romance movie La La Land.
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user2: The movie is about the celebration of love and music, I loved it.
user2: It has 92% Rotten Tomatoes rating
user2: And an IMDB rating of 8.1, which is really good.
user2: Ryan Gosling plays a Jazz pianist and Emma stone plays an aspiring actress.
user2: The movie is critically acclaimed by various critics. what do you think about the critics?

conversation:
user1: I thought that La La Land was a pretty good film. What did you think about it? 
user2: one of the reviews of the movie said that it was bad in the middle
user2: "sags bad in the middle"
user1: It did lag a little bit. I thought that Emma Stone did a good job though. Are you familiar with her work?
user2: No really. Do you generally watch movies with bad plots like La La Land
user1: Not really, I don't really like musicals all that much. 
user1: I wasn't really a big fan of the ending, to be honest. 
user2: Me neither. Do you agree with the rating the movie got?
user1: To be honest, I think that it's a little high for what the movie deserved.
user2: I feel the same way. Do you like comedy dramas though? I love them
user1: I don't think they're bad, what kind of movies are you thinking about?
user2: Not sure. But in the first scene I find Sebastian sort of full of himself by blowing off Mia. How do you feel?
user1: I agree, I didn't really like Sebastian as a character. I felt he was too arrogant. 
user2: Way too arrogant. It was really difficult to like especially when they introduced him to us this way. I thought that Mia was way too into him when she requested the song, in my opinion.
user1: Yeah, I think that they got too involved in things too fast and I know that was a point of the movie but I think it was a bit unrealistic even for movie standards.
user2: Yes. I agree. Maybe they had chemistry I don't know. 
user2: It's nice that Sebastian finally got a gig though.
user1: Yeah, I think at the end everyone was happy, even if it wasn't with each other.
user1: That's a movie trope you don't usually see because usually the main couple works it out in the end.
user2: I like how this movie deviated away from that.
user1: Yeah, it made the ending really surprising. I didn't see it coming. Not a lot of movies are like that nowadays.
user1: With Hollywood remaking everything, endings are becoming really predictable. 
user2: Yes it was nice for this movie to move from the norm. I really like Ryan's acting though.
user1: Yeah, he's not a bad actor. I think that he was better here than he was in The Notebook. 
user2: Their argument was intense. It felt real almost.
user1: Yeah, I think that was further proof of the good chemistry between the actors. I think that they did a good job casting their roles. 
user2: I wholeheartedly agree. They were perfect.
user2: I did find it heartbreaking when Sebastian said Mia only loved him when he was down on his luck or unsuccessful.
user1: Yeah, I thought that was a really realistic drama element added to the story, like I could see people really fighting about that. 
user2: Yes a Sebastian missing the play. Things spun out of hand. What did you think of Mia's play?
user1: I thought that it was really good, like I like how Mia really put her all into every role that she was in.
user2: She did. I feel like she wanted to be supported the way she supported him.
user1: Yeah, I think that she got that at the end of the play though. 
user2: Yeah you're right.
user2: I'm glad that we were able to see that.
user1: Yeah, it looks like we've been talking for enough time now. It was good talking to you. 
user2: Same

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: La La Land is a critically acclaimed musical starting Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  It has very high ratings at sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritics.
user2: What kind of ratings did it get?
user1: On Rotten Tomatoes, it received a 92% and an average of 8.6/10.  On Metacritics, it received 93/100.
user2: That's really good for rotton tomatoes. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. What is the musical about?
user1: It is a romantic comedy-drama wherein a jazz pianist (Gosling) and an aspiring actress (Stone) fall in live in LA while pursuing their dreams.
user2: That sounds interesting! Is it set in modern times  or in the past?
user1: Interestingly, it is tough to tell.  That may be a cinematic component in the main characters being out of touch with reality.
user2: That would be interesting indeed. I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but would consider going to see it. When does it come out in theaters?
user1: It came out in 2016.
user2: I see. I hadn't heard of it and thought it was something new. Why do you say that the characters may be out of touch with reality?
user1: For example, in one key scene, the pianist, Sebastian (Gosling), slips into passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from his boss to stick to traditional Christmas songs to entertain the restaurant-goers.  This gets him fired.
user2: Wow, that's intense. Was there a specific reason why he defied his boss? Was he trying to impress the girl? 
user1: He just loves jazz that much and he wants to pursue his dream at any cost.  He actually brushes off Mia (Stone) when she attempts to compliment him after he is fired.
user2: So it isn't about the girl at all and he is really passionate about his music. Does it say where love interest comes into play?
user1: Well, there is inevitable chemistry between the two main characters.  You first see it when Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he is playing in a 1980s pop cover band. 
user2: I see. So it seems that the musical is set in the past but not too distant. Was the movie nominated for any awards?
user1: It was, but we were just getting to the most interesting part of the plot!  Inspired by Sebastian's commitment to his dream of becoming a jazz performer, Mia writes a one-woman play.
user2: Is Mia an actress? Does she ask Sebastian to compose the music for the play?
user1: She is an aspiring actress, but like Sebastian, struggling in LA.  He does not compose music for the play, but instead begins to perform regularly at a jazz club.
user2: Does Sebastian get a break in his career? Is Mia's play successful?
user1: Sebastian joins a former classmate's band for steady income even though he is dismayed by the band's pop style.  That band does find success.
user2: How does the relationship between Sebastian and Mia turn out. Do they end up being together?
user1: During the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument: Mia accuses him of abandoning his dreams.  Sebastian, in turn, thinks she liked hime more when he was struggling and unsuccessful.
user2: What does Sebastian do? Does he leave the band to get back to his roots or continue touring with the band?
user1: He actually misses Mia's first performance of her play due to a band photo shoot.  
user2: So there is a struggle between Mia and Sebastian. Do they find a way to make things work?
user1: Sebastian attempts to apologize to Mia for missing the play, but she is unwilling to forgive him and ends their relationship.  Mia then leaves LA and goes back home to Boulder City, Nevada.
user2: Is that how it ends or do they reunite. Is there a happy ending?

conversation:
user1: Hi! So what did you think of the critically acclaimed film "La La Land"?
user2: I found it a little dull
user2: I mean, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are neither singing nor dancing very excaptional
user1: I'd love to hear more! What did find full about it!
user2: What do you think?
user1: I was mixed... I'm not a fan of musicals.
user2: I liked that on the one hand, it seems like a film about the world that we dream about, but on the other hand showed the cruelty of the world as it is
user2: Or more or less about the cruelty that can come out of those dreams
user1: I understand your viewpoint and agree completely. I feel the all in all, It was overrated and didn't deserve the high ratings it received on Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritics and IMDB.
user1: I thought Damien Chazelle did a great job directing. What about you?
user2: Yes! Espeacially in the middle it turned really boring
user2: Agree
user2: I find it exceptional that she managed to create a romantic comedy and a rhapsody at the same time
user1: Agreed. I felt sorry for Sebastian when he was fired at first.
user2: At first?
user1: After he was fired, but then I realized it happened for a reason as it basically introduced him to Mia.
user2: Yeah, I guess in the end we don´t have to be sorry for him anymore :)
user1: Very true. What did you think of the chemistry between the two at first?
user2: Did you find the film entertaining then?
user2: When they walked together to their cars, it was clear for me that there was a chemistry
user2: Even though they didn´t want to accept it
user1: Somewhat. There were aspects I liked and didn't like. Like you, I found parts of it dull. I loved John Legends portrayal of Keith. Were there any characters you favored?
user1: Agreed. It was apparent during the "A Lovely Night" song.
user2: I really loved Callie Hermandez as Tracy!
user2: Btw: Are you a real person?
user1: She did a great job and I loved it as well!
user2: Yes, that was the moment when I think everyone in the cinema noticed there was a chemistry
user2: What did you think about the argument Mia and Sebastian had about his dreams and success?
user1: So true... then it grew deeper, causing them to move in together!
user1: I hate she accused him of abandoning his dreams as I know he felt he was doing the right thing. How about you?
user2: Dunno. In a way, she had a point there
user2: And he just missed her play not long after
user2: If I were her, I´d have been really frustrated, too
user1: And she did I agree. It was justified. 
user1: She had every reason to say that!
user1: How did you feel about the break up?
user2: If I were her, I´d probably also have moved back home
user2: Even though it was very sad, of course
user2: What do you think?
user1: Same here.  I would have as well! Especially if I was unable to pay the theater back!
user1: It's sad how it unfolded though. 
user2: Agreed. Even though the thing with the theater wasn´t his fault
user1: Setting the musical aspect aside, What did you like most about it?
user2: I loved the modd the film creates. Like, the bittersweet happiness of treasuring something, which is vanishing
user1: That is a great point. I liked the romantic comedy aspect of it the most!
user2: Yep. And it really has a fizzy fantasy
user1: Indeed! A fizzy fantasy and hard headed fable!
user2: It´s great how they managed to make the film both, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama at the same time
user1: Is there anything else of note you liked or disliked? Of course, I disliked the musical aspect the most
user2: I also didn´t like the characters too much
user2: I mean, Sebastian was really a snob
user2: A jazz snob :D
user1: I understand. Indeed he was while Mia was trying to pursue a career in acting.
user1: Well, stranger, I think we've reached the end! I enjoyed chatting with you about La La Land!
user2: Me too!
user2: Very nice to talk to you, stranger
user1: Have a great evening! I wish you peace and happiness! I enjoyed this discussion!

conversation:
user2: Would prefer another movie
user1: Are you not a fan of musicals?
user1: I don't usually love musicals but this one sounds pretty interesting.
user1: I like the story line

conversation:
user1: Hello there! How are you?
user2: Doing well! What was that movie that you mentioned you saw that you really liked?
user1: La La Land- have you seen it?
user2: I haven't, but i've heard a lot about it. What did you think?
user1: Oh man, it's excellent! You should really watch it. It's a musical romantic comedy starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the two main characters
user1: It is very touching, and feels really authentic. Ryan Gosling is a struggling musician, and Emma Stone is an aspiring actress. They are both living in the Los Angeles area
user1: Does it sound like a movie you'd be interested in?
user2: oh that sounds pretty interesting and like it'd be right up my alley. Was it suspenseful or predictable? 
user1: I'd say it was fairly predictable, but very pleasurable entertainment

conversation:
user2: Hey
user1: HI
user2: How are you?
user1: GOOD THANKS
user2: Great. Have you seen La La land yet?
user1: Actually, I haven't.
user2: Me either
user2: What is it about?
user1: I think you're supposed to tell me..
user2: Not really
user2: You chose the film
