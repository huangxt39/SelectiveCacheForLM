James Marsden as Lon Hammond, Jr.

critical response:
striking in its rich, saturated effects' and 'actors are blessed by good material.
Gosling and especially McAdams give all-star performances, doing just enough to hand the reins over to the pros, who take what's left of the film and finish the audience off with some touching scenes that don't leave a dry eye in the house.
the scenes between the young lovers confronting adult authority have the same seething tension and lurking hysteria that the young Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood brought more than 40 years ago to their roles in Splendor in the Grass.
Never mind that McAdams and Gosling don't for a minute call to mind 1940s America; they're both suitably attractive and appealing. Gosling, who delivered a searing and largely unseen screen debut performance in the 2001 drama The Believer, is particularly convincing as a young man who charms his way past a girl's strongest defenses.' 
Amid the sticky-sweet swamp of Jeremy Leven's script, Rowlands and Garner emerge spotless and beatific, lending a magnanimous credibility to their scenes together. These two old pros slice cleanly through the thicket of sap-weeping dialogue and contrivance, locating the terror and desolation wrought by the cruel betrayals of a failing mind.
Audiences craving big, gooey over-the-top romance have their must-see summer movie in The Notebook.
already one of the most intriguing young thesps, Gosling extends his range to pure romance without sacrificing a bit of his naturally subversive qualities, and even seems comfortable looking beautiful in a manly American way. The head-turner is McAdams, doing such a different perf from her top bitch in Mean Girls that it's hard to tell it's the same actor. She skillfully carries much of the film's emotional weight with a free and easy manner.

description:
In 1940, Seabrook Island, South Carolina, Noah Calhoun is smitten with 17 year old heiress Allison 'Allie' Hamilton after seeing her at a carnival, and they have a summer love affair. Noah takes Allie to an abandoned house that he intends to buy for them. They try to make love, but are interrupted by Noah's friend Fin with the news that Allie's parents have the police looking for her. When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, Allie's mother Anne calls Noah trash and they ban her from seeing Noah. Noah walks out and Allie chases after him. The ensuing argument between the two ends in a break up and the next morning, Anne announces that the family is returning home to Charleston.  
Noah writes to Allie every day for a year but Anne intercepts the letters and they never reach Allie. Noah enlists with Fin to fight in World War II, where Fin is killed in battle. Allie volunteers in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets officer Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money. The two become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents.  When Noah returns from the war, his father has sold their home so that Noah can buy the abandoned house. While visiting Charleston, Noah witnesses Allie and Lon kissing at a restaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will come back to him. Allie is startled to read in the newspaper that Noah has completed the house to the specifications she made years before. 
Allie returns to Seabrook to find Noah living in the restored house. The two renew their relationship and make love. In the morning, Anne appears on Noah's doorstep, warning Allie that Lon has followed her to Seabrook. Anne reveals that in her youth she had been in love with a lower-class young man and still thinks of him. She then gives Allie the letters that Noah wrote to her, admitting that she hid them from Allie. Allie confesses to Lon that she has been spending time with Noah, and tells him she knows she should be with him, but she remains indecisive. Ultimately, she goes back to her relationship with Noah.

user1: Now is the 52% based on critic reviews or users?
user2: I don't know. I thought everybody loved this movie lol!
user1: To me the older versions of themselves really struck a chord with me.
user1: Maybe it wasn't as great based on its technical merits
user1: Sometimes movies can be enjoyable regardless
user2: Possibly. To me it's just the perfect example of two lovers forever struggling to be together.
user1: Yup I agree with that
user1: Thats actually a great way to put it
user1: Did you have a favorite scene?
user2: The older versions of themselves was just the most touching part of this movie. Till the end they stayed together even when she no longer knew who he was. It's just so touching.
user1: Yeah, it was so sad at how alzheimers just eats away at your memory like that. 
user2: I don't have a favorite lol. I just loved this movie as a whole. Some parts and scenes were more touching than others but it's just an overall love for the entire movie.
user2: Yes it is.
user2: I can't imagine losing my counterpart like that.
user1: I can't believe that its been out for 14 years though! I saw it at the theaters too lol

user2: No I don’t
user1: The movie we got is The Notebook.  Do you know it?
user2: What do we chat about?
user2: I’ve seen it but a while back.
user1: Since you didn't get the document, I have to give you info to respond to.
user2: Okay cool. So whats this movie about?
user1: This was a love story between a man a woman who is now in a nursing home.
user1: We see them both in their older days and younger days.
user2: How romantic. I like movies like that. Who acts in it?
user1: This movie made stars out of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.
user2: Ryan Gosling is the best, so this is the movie that made him big. Is it a period piece?
user1: you could say that, because it starts in 1940
user1: in the U.S. south
user1: one thing that might surprise fans is that it didn't get great reviews from critics.  they thought it was too sappy
user2: Yeah I don’t really listen to critics as most times they get it wrong. Did you think it was too sappy?
user1: i remember liking it, that it felt like a real love affair
user1: they feed me more information the longer we chat.
user2: Nice. Do you know who directed it?
user1: the director is named Nick Cassavetes.  his mother actually plays the older version of the female lead
user2: Wow that is amazing but maybe would be tough to direct your own Mother. Do you know what rating the movie got like on Rotten Tomato?
user1: 52%
user2: That sucks. What was your best scene?
user1: the next scene they mention is how the girl's mother hides the boy's letters from her, because she doesn't want her daughter to be with him
user2: What wouldn’t they want them to be together? Is he a bad boy?
user1: she's from a rich family.  he's not.
user1: final scene to discuss:  the mother admits what she's done and gives her daughter the letters
user2: Okay get it now. I guess that ended up well. 
user1: by then, her daughter had gotten engaged to someone else
user2: Oh no, so how did they get back together?
user1: her mom shows her what became of lower-class boy she loved once (he's still lower class).  she didn't want her daughter to struggle with money
user1: the daughter just has to decide what's important to her
user1: in the end, she chooses the lower class guy
user2: I guess she made the right choice then, to chose her happiness and get with him?
user2: Sounds like a fantastic movie.
user2: Do you know when it was released?
user1: 2004
user2: That was a while back.
user1: yeah
user2: Was there any critical reviews or responses about it?
user1: they praise the performances, but criticize the "sappy" writing
user1: are you a love story fan?
user2: Do you consider it to be one of the classics? 
user2: I like Love stories
user1: not exactly a classic, maybe.  but pretty good.  
user1: i'm surprised the task hasn't ended yet
user2: I know.
user2: It makes me want to watch the movie again.
user2: Was there anything about it that you didn’t like?

conversation:
user2: good morning!
user1: Good morning!
user2: say, do you like romantic drama?
user1: I believe I am the only person who has not seen this movie!
user1: I do, but my wife enjoys it more for sure!
user1: I'm surprised the Notebook only got a 50% rating, it has become so popular.
user2: indeed, its gone down as a great, for some reason 
user2: ryan gosling was just too convincing i suppose
user1: I do like the actors, both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.
user2: great thespians to be sure
user1: Have you read the 1994 novel?
user2: i have not!
user1: I do like period pieces though, so being set in 1940 appeals to me.
user2: indeed. gosling has a knack for them! big fan of gangster squad myself
user1: Yes that is more down my alley also.
user1: So I guess they play the young lovers, who then become the older people narrating the story?
user1: I assume you've seen it.
user2: i guess so! all i have is this document, and that scene where ryan gosling is in the rain. thats all i know!

user2: needs more time travel
user2: seabrook eh
user2: ever been to the carolinas?
user2: i went to the outer banks once in North carolina
user1: No all I know is from Dawson's Creek lol
user1: It seems like a great spot to set a romance movie though
user1: I may have to actually watch this, I'm slightly intrigued
user2: pretty beaches
user2: yeah, i feel like its one to cross off the list, heh
user1: Now we know the ending though. The mom shows her the intercepted letters and all is forgiven.
user2: clearly gotta see it all go down, right?
user2: some day, some day.
user1: Wow so this must have been one of Gosling's early movies. I didn't realize it was that old.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: Are familiar with the movie The notebook?
user1: I have heard about it but have not seen it
user1: What is it about?
user2: Its a romance movie based on the 1996 novel with the same title by Nicholas Sparks
user1: Who are some of the actors in the film?
user2: Ryan Gosling as the main actor and Rachel McAdams
user1: Interesting. I'm a fan of his work, what are your thoughts on the movie?
user2: I actually cried when I first watch it. It is awesome. Got 52 percent in rotten tomatoes but I will give it a 100 
user1: Really? Would you say it resembles the book well?
user2: There are some changes but pretty much. I only care about the ending anyway. Ryan Gosling play as Noah in the movie, he is poor while Allie is from a rich family and she is engage with someone else but fell in love with Noah 
user1: Oh wow that seems really interesting. I will have to check it out for sure. Do you know if its available on netflix? 
user2: Hmm not sure. It was released year 2004 so it probably is
user1: Ahhh okay, So based on what you know about the movie are their cheesy or cliche elements portrayed in the film?
user2: not at all but that is for me. it is heart touching and will make you cry. if made me cry. Allie got Alzheimer and she doesn't remember Noah but he still visits her everyday and they died together  
user1: omg!!! thats so crazy honestly kind of excited to see this movie now 
user2: Yes, its an art, love the book but I love the movie more
user1: Thats how i felt with the fault in our stars. Great book but movie was incredible.
user2: When he enlisted in the army he writes to her everyday but her mom intercept the letters so she was devastated for a year
user2: I love that movie too!
user1: Damn so this movie is like a mix of saving private Ryan, me before you, and possible other movies
user2: Somewhat but much better. I don't know why it got low rating, it is one of my favorite movie
user1: I mean rotten tomato is pretty picky on certain movies which i dont get cause some films are brilliant but do not get the credit they deserve
user2: I know. It probably on personal preference. Others might not like it
user1: Side track how long is this task suppose to be?
user1: But i agree that its a personal preference
user2: Not sure but we have to talk about the movie till we can click the finished conversation button 
user2: Are you familiar with the director? Nick Cassavetes
user1: i am not
user1: what are some of his other movies?

conversation:
user2: Howdy.
user1: Hi there!
user1: The movie we have been assigned is "The Notebook." I love this movie! You should see it! Ryan Gosling is in it!
user2: How old is it? When did it come out?
user2: I don't think I've heard of it. What is it about?
user1: I am not sure when it came out, but I do know that it is based on the Nicholas Sparks novel written in 1996.
user1: It is about a young couple who fall in love in the 40's
user2: Ah, I've heard of Nicholas Sparks. I'm pretty sure my wife likes his stuff. 
user2: So, a love story?
user2: And I assume you mean the 1940's. Not in the future.
user1: Oh well, Rachel McAdams, is in it....might be more appealing to you LOL
user2: Ah, yes. I do like Rachel McAdams.
user2: Did you just see it, or was it a while ago when it came out?
user1: Yes, 1940's lol. Yes, a love story with some break ups and make ups
user1: No, its my go to drama/romance movie...
user2: Rachel McAdams has the best smile. But, that's probably not the point of this conversation. So, that's your whole argument for me seeing it? It's a love story? Or, because it has Rachel McAdams in it? Anything surprising in it? A twist?
user1: There are some twists...the parents ban them from seeing each other....she moves away
user1: It is just beautiful, it is narrated by the future man who has loved her all of his life....
user2: Wow...you're a real person. And, I'm guessing, a woman (since I mostly admitted I'm a man).  I think that might be a first for me in this situation on MTurk! Wait...so, the male protagonist throughout the movie isn't the one narrating it?
user1: Meaning the older character played by Ryan, his name is Noah
user2: Hmmm...would you characterize this as a "chic flic"?
user2: (Apologies if that's offensive.)
user1: I am! Every day, after Allie (Rachel) leaves...No not offensive, if you consider American romantic dramas, chick flicks..then yes LOL but my husband loves it LOL don't tell him I said so
user1: Noah writes a letter to her for a year
user1: They are 17 and he knows then how much he loves her. But, her mom keeps the letters from her and she becomes engaged because she doesn't know!!
user2: I like most movies. I lean towards science fiction and fantasy, but I will watch whatever is available. When I'm watching with my wife...she bans any and all of my preferred genres and we watch things like...The Notebook (at least, based on your description, that's the kind of thing we watch). I know she has read a bunch of Nicholas Sparks books. I will MAYBE mention this movie to her to see if she's interested.
user2: Meddling parents. I was just going to comment on how old-fashioned that is, but you said it's from the 40's, so, that answers that.
user2: Of course she'll be interested, actually. There's no debate about that. And being as I will watch anything, there's really no reason for us not to watch it, so I may as well just rent it from Amazon or whoever has it and call it a date.
user2: Does it appeal to all ages (well, all adult ages)? How old are you and your husband (who, apparently, loves it)? How long have you been married?
user1: The story is amazing to watch. I wish I would be able to find out what you think LOL No man walks away without tears in this one. I think it does appeal to all ages. I am 40 and my husband is 31. We have been married for 3 years
user2: NO MAN WALKS AWAY WITHOUT TEARS!?
user2: Pretty strong words.
user2: This May is our 30th anniversary. Now, I have watched "Lost" twice, and both times, during the finale, I did cry. Well, there were tears. No, it was definitely crying. But, that was "Lost".  The best serial drama on TV EVER. So, you're trying to tell me that "The Notebook" is the equivalent of "Lost"?
user2: And since you were forthcoming, my wife and I are 51.
user2: She is 27 days older than me...and won't let me forget it.  "Respect your elders", she says.
user2: How long have you been turking?
user1: I am not sure if we are done with the task or if I will get rejected for going off story, but what evs...I have been turking for about a month.
user2: Seriously, I don't think I've ever been paired with an actual person before. This is kind of cool. Not that it should be; chatting online is nothing new. But the novelty of a survey that's not based on deception and that has a real person on the other end is so rare (for me) that is is, indeed, a novelty.
user1: Very minimally. I have a 18 month old, so I get MAYBE and hour on here. 
user2: I don't think we'll get rejected, so long as you don't give me more information than was in whatever you read.
user1: I am surprised that turking is an actual paying thing...I have been looking for work from home work for so long and its all scams! I work, but wanted to make just some extra...
user1: I do not think I did LOL
user1: And the end result was that you will watch it!! So WINNING! LOL
user2: Congratulations on your 18 month old.  All mine (three girls) are grown (though the middle one, 28 years old, still lives with us). I started in September or October of last year, and made about $800. So far this year I've made about $320.  Well, I see the Finish Conversation button is available. It was a real pleasure chatting with you.
user2: Yes, I am DEFINITELY going to watch "The Notebook". You're very persuasive.
user1: You as well sir! Good luck in life to you! Thank you for making this fun!
user1: RI out!
user2: Have a good night!  Bye...

conversation:
user2: Hey!
user1: Hello!
user2: This movie received mixed reviews
user2: What do you think about it?
user1: I think I might be the only girl who doesn't like the notebook
user1: I liked the timeline of the film but there were unnessasery amount of screen time spent on pointless moments.
user2: Haha okay. I really like Ryan and Rachel so I'm assuming this movie is good. I haven't seen it yet though because the trailer looked cheesy.
user1: Both actors are excellent in the film 
user2: I haven't read the book either.
user2: Nice
user1: I think I just have a biased opinion with Nicholas sparks books Made into films
user2: Do you read his books?
user2: I think it's cute that he tries to buy her a house in scene 1
user1: When i was 15 I read a few 
user2: Allie's mom seems rude
user2: What do you think of scene 1
user1: Upper class family's in films always appear to be rude
user2: Yeah
user1: The ending I think really does it for alot of people 
user2: Okay so this is during the WOrld Wars
user1: I like the vintage look in the first scenes
user2: It's getting sad at this point
user1: I think is 50/50 either you love it or hate it
user2: It seems like Noah's kind of like Gatsby in this scene since he's convinced a house is what will bring Allie
user2: back to him
user1: Material things 
user2: Anne interferes too much
user2: I'm glad Allie ends up with Noah
user2: I feel bad for Lon
user2: What do you think of the last scene?
user1: Eh, this film is like the love in titanic 
user2: Hahah
user1: There are great moments but over all the film is a bore
user2: I see
user1: The ending is one of those great moments 
user2: That's good to know
user2: It looks like we're done
user2: Nice talking to you

conversation:
user2: Have you ever seen the 2004 hit The Notebook starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAadams?
user1: No I have not seen that movie.
user2: Do you enjoy romance movies in general?
user1: Yes, I really love romance movies Does the movie involve two people who fall in love?
user2: I don't want to spoil this movie, but yes it is an epic romance that takes place over the lifetime of two young people from days gone by.
user1: Does the romance movie have funny moments like a romantic comedy would have or is it a serious romantic movie?
user2: I would say there is a healthy amount of both. There are moments of pure drama and some sadness, but there are also moments of pure elation that can be felt very deeply by the person watching. 
user1: Did you like the movie enough that you got absorbed into the story line?
user2: Yes definitely. It almost feels like you are in the movie with them. I especially loved one of the scenes in the middle where they are fighting and it seems like they hate each other but they end up kissing. It feels very realastic. 
user1: Is there any foul language or sex in the movie? What is the rating?
user2: There are some sensitive scenes and mild foul language, but nothing that would be more than a PG 13 rating.
user1: So would you recommend a teenager watch this movie if I took my daughter to it?
user2: Every teen is different but i personally saw this movie when i was a teenager and i still love this movie to this day. The romance between the two main characters Noah and Allie is such a classic love story. 
user1: Was there any religious theme to the movie regarding God or morality?
user2: No there isn't much regarding religion in this movie. It is more of the "wrong kid from the wrong tracks" falls in love with a wealthy girl and her parents doesn't approve of the match, but that doesn't stop their love story from unfolding. 
user1: Did they have any children together in this movie?
user2: Yes but you find that out later on in the movie.  While watching you realize alongside Allie and Noah that their relationship might be to hard to keep from falling apart and they both move on from each other, even though their love is still very much a part of them.
user1: How did a rich girl meet the poor boy from the wrong side?
user2: They met how many people did before internet dating. They met at a social gathering among friends at a carnival. 
user1: Did both characters realize right away that it was love between them?
user2: In their relationship Noah is the sure and steady one. He knew right away he had to meet this girl. Allie was smitten but was more reserved than Noah.
user1: What made Allie realize that Noah was the one for her?
user2: I think it is Noahs persistence and tenacity. I personally really like the continuing theme of houses throughout the m ovie. As a labor of love Noah completely rebuilds Allie and his dream house, it becomes his obsession even after they broke up because of the pressure of Allies family, particularly mother. 
user1: Is it a superficial material love since Noah builds Allie a dream home to win her heart?
user2: Oh no it is anything but a superficial love. Noah's father sold his tiny home to buy Noah the run down dream home that he knew his son and Allie both treasured. Noah after returning from the war decided to fix it up, not knowing if he would ever even see Allie again. If he couldnt have Allie because she was to be married to another man then Noah figured he at least could fix up the house. But Allie did come back.
user1: So when Allie came back and saw what Noah did it touched her heart? Would that be the main climax of the movie?
user2: Yes, that is when she realized he was still very m uch in love with her just as she was with him.
user1: So was that the end of the movie?
user2: Not quite, the few last scenes of the movie show a much older Noah and Allie rehashing their love story. only Allie cannot remember most of it.  Noah spends day in and day out trying to "bring his Allie back to him"
user1: Does he ever get her back? Is it a happy ending?
user2: In many ways it is a happy ending, only not a typically hollywood happy ending. Allie remembers Noah and their life together. 
user1: Sounds like a wonderful movie that I will go and see. Thank you so much for the information and sharing.

user1: Nicholas Sparks is a great novelist.
user2: Yeah I love his books1
user2: And me either, I was surprised and always thought that was the coolest "twist".
user2: Do you like Rachel McAdams or Ryan Gosling much in other movies? I don't but I liked them in this one.
user1: I like Gosling in other movies but they were really great together in this one. 
user1: I agree with you.
user1: Who else was in this movie?
user2: I don't recognize their names, but the sheet says Joan Allen and James Marsden. 
user2: I agree too, they had really good chemistry. 
user1: Oh that's right. Joan Allen was the main character's mom.
user2: I think the Notebook is like such the classic romance film, all the ones since (Nicholas Sparks included) haven't had the same vibe. 
user1: It's definitely a romcom shoe in
user2: Oh yeah, I don't know any other roles she's had haha. 
user1: It's a big gooey over the top romance film
user2: Yeah and funny too because Rachel McAdams had done more goofy roles like Mean Girls but after this movie she did a lot more similar novel-based romance film roles, like time travelers wife and stuff
user2: people must have really liked her as a romance character
user1: That's true.
user1: It's funny how the film got such crappy reviews.
user2: Yeah haha you'd think people who aren't into that kind of thing wouldn't bother watching at all right?
user2: I mean I guess there are like really cool art films and new wave and stuff but when it comes to block buster movies, it's not like there are a ton of super amazing romances- this one definitely is one of the best even if a little cheesy.
user1: I think that people love to hate these movies
user1: They're the nickelback of films
user2: Hahahaha
user1: It's weird that they referred to the script as sticky sweet
user2: But you could probably  "hate" watch this movie much easier than listen to nickleback hahah
user2: I know haha, that seems like sort of off- I guess they meant saccharine?
user1: So true
user1: Haha I guess...these reviews are so over the top
user2: I know haha but you know a lot of my favorites get bad reviews, and I think you're right people just like to hate
user2: a lot of "classic" movies still get really bad reviews on those websites probably from people who want to seem smarter and more patrician than the average movie watcher :p
user1: That's true! Nice talking with you. Have a good one.

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello
user2: Have you seen the movie The Notebook
user1: Not yet. Is it any good?
user2: It is a good movie.It stars Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling
user1: Wow, nice.
user2: Yes, it is a love story about a young couple who fall in love in the 40s but it is told in present by an older gentleman in a nursing home
user1: I like classic movies. It sounds very interesting. 
user2: It is definitely a mush love story. Classic movies are great too.
user1: I see.
user2: The characters names are Allie and Noah
user2: James Garner and Gena Rolands are also in it so it has a pretty good cast.
user1: Okay. I'm not familiar with them. 
user2: The music is really good also
user1: Okay, nice
user2: It is considered to be a dramatic romance movie
user1: Sounds interesting, I must say. 
user2: I like Rachel McAdams in this but also loved her in Mean Girls
user1: Nice. You said the name of the movie was Notebook- I wonder why that name?
user1: Any idea?
user2: Well the movie is about them meeting at a carnival and falling in love and having a summer love affair. Her parents were rich and did not want him with her so maybe she wrote about it in a notebook
user2: I think it is a different name for a movie
user1: Oh, okay, 
user1: Names matter to me in movies. 
user1: They have to flow. 
user2: It's a different name 
user2: so it sounds okay
user1: interesting 
user2: Yes I think a name is an important part on whether you would see a movie or not
user1: Yes
user1: Indeed 

conversation:
user1: Hi! 
user2: Hello
user2: We get to talk about The Notebook.  Have you seen it?
user1: I haven't seen it. Tell me about it.
user1: It sounds really interesting!
user2: It's striking in its rich, saturated effects and the actors are blessed by good material
user2: It has a rotten tomatoes score of 52%
user2: It stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams
user1: That's an okay score for rotten tomatoes. I usually don't base my movie choices off of their scoring system.
user1: Ryan Gosling is a great actor! I love everything he plays in.
user1: What's the plot? Love story?
user2: Me too!  This movie was out in 2004 so I'm surprised you didn't see it
user2: It's a romantic drama
user2: Written by Nicholas Sparks
user1: I know right? It sounds like something I would definite be interested in.
user1: I was a senior in school in 2004, and a movie hopper. I'm surprised I haven't seen it either.
user1: Is it a movie you would watch repeatedly?
user2: If you crave big, gooey over the top romance, it's a must see movie
user1: Will it have me on the edge of my seat?
user2: Gosling and McAdams give all-star performances
user1: I don't doubt it! Is the movie predictable in anyway?
user2: The scenes between the young lovers confronting adult authority have the same seething tension and lurking hysteria that the young Warren Beaty and natalie wood brought more than 40 years ago to their roles in Splendor in the Grass
user1: Sounds juicy. 
user1: Is there anything about the movie, one would consider triggering?
user2: The head turner is McAdams doing such a different performance from her top bitch in Mean Girls
user2: It's hard to tell its the same actor!
user1: Oh wow!
user1: Is it a tear jerker?
user2: Noah writes Allie every day for a year but she never gets the letters
user2: Then Noah goes off to war and Allie gets engaged to someone else
user1: I can imagine her heart ache thinking he may have forgot about her
user1: oh no
user2: Do you like this type of movie?
user1: I do. I love romantic stories

conversation:
user2: Hi there! What are your thoughts on The Notebook?
user1: I don't normally go for romances, but I'm a big fan of James Garner. He really made it feel less like a romance more... I dunno, more interesting though.
user1: What do you think of it?
user2: I agree. He reminds me of my grandfather, and my grandmother died of Alzheimer's so that move is really hard for me to watch. I thought the reviews were interesting. I didn't think of it as sappy, more sad. It's strange to me that the reviewers did.
user1: Sorry about your grandmother. Reviewers can get it wrong, sometimes. It didn't feel like a '40's film, makes me wonder how much of this was in Garner's head.
user2: Yeah, it didn't seem like it was set that far back to me either. I love Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, though!
user2: And thank you!
user2: I had forgotten than James Marsden was in it. Did he play her husband? 
user2: Or fiance, whichever it was
user1: They act well together, it makes me happy seeing them on the big screen. James Marsden, I think he was the fiance yes. The missus is a big fan of him, ever since Buffy lol
user2: I've never seen Buffy! I didn't realize he was in that. 
user1: I believe he played Spike, a vampire and main love interest of the vampire hunter. ^^
user1: Might have been a different guy though.
user2: Ah gotcha. That show was out when I was pretty young, so I only know it by reference. 
user1: Fair enough. I've only caught bits and pieces, I've only really paid attention to Joss Whedon's later stuff... Dr Horrible's Sing Along Blog had me dying, I swear.
user2: Yeah, I'm more of a sci-fi person, too. I'm not a big fan of any of the Nicholas Sparks movies because of that. While I didn't find The Notebook to be sappy (probably because of personal stuff), I can't stand the rest of his movies. 
user2: Well, movies based on his books anyway
user1: I can agree there. Sci-fi is good for me, even if hollywood doesn't seem to big on it. I haven't read much of Nicholas Spark's books, been meaning to read the Notebook though, just for reference.
user2: Ah, they updated the page. I didn't realize it was set in South Carolina! 
user1: I read Charleston and thought West Virginia, that's news to me. Hmm... Yep, definitely the fiance, he caught her kissing Marsden
user2: I knew southeastern US because of the accents, but didn't pay much attention to that detail. 
user1: The accents should have been a dead giveaway, I never really thought about it. ^^ 
user2: I can't imagine this movie without them. I'm from the Midwest and I don't think the star-crossed lovers has the same effect with our nasal accents
user1: I've traveled a little bit, but I'm more south-west. That Annie, she was a mean one, huh?
user2: They wrote her perfectly. A character you love to hate is the best!
user1: You aren't wrong, and Joan Allen nailed that role!
user2: Yes! She was the perfect choice for that character
user1: I can't imagine any other actress quite pulling it off.
user2: They really did a great job casting the whole thing. I totally believed that James Garner was Noah (once you figured that part out lol) 
user1: lol Yeah, at first glance I might have thought Lon but... that wouldn't make sense once you get further into the film. All in all, I feel 5.7/10 wasn't a far review. I'd have said at least an 8.0
user2: Agreed. It definitely wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but that's a pretty low score. I'm sure it was another one of those movies where the critics bashed it because it wasn't serious enough.
user1: Sounds just about right. Well, it was great meeting you! 

conversation:
user2: Hi there how are ya today?
user2: So the movie we are going to chat about is "The Notebook" directed by Nick Cassavetes. 
user1: This is an american romantic drama
user2: yes it is, Have you seen it?
user1: Both the main actors gave allstar preformances
user1: Yes
user2: What did you think of Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun?
user1: It is narated by an elderly man
user1: He was great
user2: I thought Rachel McAdams did a great job as Allison Hamilton. Did you know the movie was based on the 1996 Novel by the same name?
user1: No
user2: Yes the author was Nicholas Sparks. The elderly man you spoke of that narrated was James Garner.
user1: What did you like about the movie?
user2: I enjoyed the scenery and lifelike storyline. The movie was set in Seabrook Island South Carolina. 
user1: It only got a 52% on rotren tomatoes.
user2: yes, I dont trust rotten tomatoes, I dont even know how that became a rating system
user1: The name of the movie is the notebook.
user2: Yes you are correct
user2: So the characters Noah writes to Allie everyday, can you relate to anything like this?
user1: Yes. I liked he was so devoted.
user1: Its sad his letters were not delivered.
user1: Dont you think
user1: He even fixes the house thinking that would fix the problems in his relationship.
user1: Can you relate to any of this?
user2: I certainly can, military life was almost the same. Being seperated that is.
user2: It was definately sad, I cried did you?
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user1: No
user2: Do you usually watch movies with good or bad ratings? Or do you just not pay attention to the rating?
user2: Are you still here?
user2: if ya answer we can finish the conversation
user2: ALlie eventually returm
user2: ns to be with him (Noah)
user2:  She confesses to LOn that shes been spending time with Noah

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you seen the Notebook yet?
user1: I have, it tugged at my heart quite a bit. How about you?
user2: Yes it I cried when I watched it, Nicholas Sparks usually does that pretty well.
user2: I enjoy Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams acting in this movie.
user1: Yes, all of his books are pretty spectacular but this one especially so.
user1: Some people call it over the top, but I very much liked the plot and thought it fit well
user2: I don't think it was too over the top, it was believable
user2: Nick Cassavetes did a great job on directing, I never read the book though.
user1: Agreed, You would think that this was an entirely plausible thing to happen in real life
user1: I haven't read the book either, but I heard that it earned some awards
user1: Not unlike the movie
user1: The ratings though on this movie can be seen as misleading if you are a big fan of the romance genre
user2: I believe that, I don't know if you ever saw Mean Girls but it's amazing how well she acted compared to how she acted in that movie
user2: I love how the movie is kind of centered around the house he remodels because of her.
user1: Yes I have, quite a different part to play for the actress for sure
user2: Although I couldn't believe how her parent's treated him, it's amazing how much money and class had to do with people's relationships back then
user1: Yes and it all began after that fateful trip to the carnival that one night
user2: Yes, I had almost forgotten about the carnival.
user1: True. Parenting was so different back then, banning offspring from seeing other people
user1: It's so touching when he starts writing the love letters
user2: I found it despicable that her mother hid all those letters from her, things would have been so different.
user1: Yeah totally gave him the wrong impression. Still he goes and buys that house they were in anyways
user2: Yes he does, he looked past what her parents thought of him in the end. 
user1: Even after seeing her kiss someone else
user2: I'm glad she didn't stay with the man she was to marry, I think she would have been unhappy all her life, like her mother
user1: Most definitely. She reunites with Noah, and sparks start flying
user1: It's like falling in love all over again
user2: The sparks fly right away!
user2: I think her mother felt guilty in the end because she was still in love with the man she couldn't be with
user1: At the end of the day, she puts money aside, tells her fiance she is in love with Noah, and goes back to her true love
user2: He let her go pretty easily, I was afraid that there would be more drama involved with that
user1: That's a good point. I'm glad it was resolved as easily as it did though
user1: You can tell they were definitely not meant for each other, Lon and Allie
user1: Great performance from the actors'actresses to convey that
user2: No they weren't, they had many different interests and it seems that he didn't put her first like Noah did
user2: Yes, everyone did such a great job acting in this film
user1: Yeah Noah was all for her and that shows true dedication
user1: Something that is hard to find in life today. That's why i think the movie has such broad appeal

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1: as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s.  Their story is narrated from the present
user2: What movie is this?
user1: The Notebook
user2: oh ok, I have seen bits and pieces of this film. I am not really into romantic movies, being a guy and all.

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: hello
user1: have you seen the movie?
user2: wh
user2: yes
user1: what was your fav scene
user2: the scene at the ferris wheel
user2: yours?
user1: gosh thats hard, it was agreat movie
user2: indeed! 
user2: the story really portrays true love..do agree?
user1: i just got dumb founded on the movie at hand lol whats the name
user2: the notebook, a romantic film
user1: ok i could picture but couldnt name it, and yes it does, they have a great vibe together
user2:  The performance of Ryan Gosling was stellar
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user2: still there?

conversation:
user2: Hey there.
user2: Based on the movie we were assigned how much do you like the Notebook?
user2: I'm not the biggest romance fan but this movie was pretty great, their performances were on point don't you agree?
user2: 1940's didn't have phones so none of this texting flirting that's been standardized 
user1: The movie sounds great. I love Rachel McAdams, I will see any of her movies.
user2: They actually have real connection y'know?
user1: Do you enjoy movies based on novels? 
user2: Both actors are very easy on the eyes I'm sure that added to a huge factor
user2: Not necessarily 
user2: When it comes to novels, I prefer the books over the movies but this was great.
user2: Do you generally watch romance movies?
user1: I agree with you there, books have way more detail. It sounds like the notebook was a great adaptation.
user1: I love romance movies. Mostly romantic comedy.
user2: Yea no doubt
user2: To reiterate I'm not a big fan of romance movies but
user2: The Notebook was just great
user2: Their performance was just
user2: Woow
user1: I have to admit I have not seen the notebook, but it does sound great.What most did you like about it.
user2: Really it was the portrayal of emotions 
user2: It says a lot about a person when they're able to display a whole scene with just their emotions alone
user1: Yes I have to agree with you. I like the blurb in hey scenes. It does a good job of portraying what the movies about. 
user1:  I didn't realize Allie was only 17. That's young for a summer love affair. I assumed she was older than that. 
user1: I enjoy movies that are in based in the early 1900's to 1940's like this, do you? 
user1: I also love flash backs like this movie. How the old man is telling another nursing home resident about the past. 
user1: The critics seemed to really enjoy the movie. The movie must be great for them all of them to agree.
user1: Do you watch a movie based on what a critic says? or do you ignore them? 

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello
user2: are you ready or still reading?
user1: I'm ready
user2: okay perfect!
user2: Do you like the Notebook?
user1: I love this movie!
user2: so you should be good at answering all the questions :)
user1: I hope so. How did you like it?
user2: honestly, i thought it was a little sad.
user1: I though Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams made a great pair for this movie.
user2: what type of movies do you like?
user2: are you the one changing the slides?
user1: We are supposed to only chat about the present paragraph, and no I have no control over this task, just what I say.
user1: It was very sad when Allie's mom made her and Noah stop seeing each other.
user2: wow they had a love affair was this when Noah was 17?
user2: How old is Noah?
user1: I'm not sure, but I believe he was close to Allie's age. How did you feel when Allie moved back to Charleston with her parents?
user2: good since they are young and have may more years to live!
user1: Oh no, it made me very upset. I was also upset when Allie's mother was hiding all of the letter from Noah.
user2: Allie then Becomes a great nurse in WWII
user2: which is better than falling in love at 17 
user1: I don't think so, she only volunteered in the hospital. She met another man there.
user2: wow, noah saw allie! with the guy :(
user1: Yeah, he did. She still loves Noah though. She was just unaware of all of the letters. Her parents encouraged her to be with Lon.
user2: she read in the paper that noah finished building the house.  I think the real hero is his father!
user2: selling their land for him to get the girl back.
user2: Allie then goes to Noah
user1: That was a very touching part of the story. It finally made Allie's mom give her the letters.
user1: Her mother realized that she couldn't stop Allie from seeing and being with Noah.
user2: okay, so allie is not with her lover.
user1: I am glad that Allie ultimately chose Noah, they belong together.
user2: i hope so!
user1: Lon didn't seem all that upset anyway. Noah treated her much better.
user2: yeah very nice story 
user2: very touching and love at real sight!
user1: It sure is

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Have you seen The Notebook? It is a very good romantic film.
user1: Yes I hear it is a really good romantic drama, but I have not seen it yet.
user2: Ryan Gosling definitely became a popular actor after it, even more so than before.
user2: A total "Hunk of Hollywood" people would say.
user1: The movie came out in 2004, I should have seen it by now. Looks like I am missing out on the "hunk"!
user1: Is Rachel McAdams a popular actress?
user2: She certainly is! She is very beautiful and very well versed in dramas.
user1: Seems like this movie will make me cry!
user2: Their chemistry on screen was perfect.
user2: It definitely made me cry!
user1: Sounds interesting, I love a good love story for sure!
user1: Rotten Tomatoes score is 52%, I would expect much higher
user2: I haven't read the novel it is based off of yet.
user1: Oh my it is based off a novel? I wonder if I should read the novel or watch the movie first?
user2: Nicholas Sparks wrote The Notebook and also wrote A Walk to Remember
user1: The movie is set in the 1940s, that may be affecting the rating.
user2: A Walk to Remember was also made into a film!
user2: True
user2: Especially for being in 2004.
user1: I believe I have heard of the director, Nick Cassavetes, before.
user1: I would still think Ryan Gosling would bring a higher rating.
user2: Yes, he directed My Sisters Keeper.
user2: I would think so too!
user2: He was recently in the new BladeRunner
user1: Allison is an heiress, that sounds so cool!
user1: This movie is set in South Carolina, such a beautiful place!
user2: It is!
user2: It adds to the romance of the film.
user1: Awww Noah writes Allie letters every day for a year, how sweet!
user2: There is a scene where they kiss in the rain.
user2: It has become an iconic scene.
user1: I can see that, South Carolina is very romantic.
user2: World War II love stories are also very romantic!
user1: The scene where Noah walks out seems very intense!

conversation:
user1: How romantic did you find The Notebook? It's definitely a movie that has been talked about in most regards because of it's strong romantic ties. Did you think Ryan Gosling extended his range? 
user2:  I beleive his performance is excellent. And yes, I found this movie very romantic
user2: What´s your opinion about Rachel McAdams acting?
user1: She's stunningly beautiful, I found that she had more charisma in the movie than Ryan Gosling did. What's your favorite scene? Mine is the swamp scene where it starts raining. Did you like the theme of it being in the 1940's?
user2: My favorite Scene is that one two! it was remarkable!. I did like the 1940´s  ambience. It added more romantic to the hole story
user2: Did you find ussefull the fact that the story was tell on the present days?
user1: Yeah I enjoyed that it shifted back and forth from the time they met through the time they spent at the nursing home. Are you surprised that it didn't get better reviews from the critic websites like Rotten Tomatoes? For a movie that's talked about a lot I'm kind  of surprised by that. 
user2: me too. I don´t get it! for me the notebook is much better movie from all points of views. But who can understand critics?
user1: Have you gotten the new document?

user2: Yeah it does.
user2: What do you think of the storyline?
user1: I think it's beautiful. I definitely cried a gallon of tears

user2: When they shared memories in the old persons home.

user1: Pretty much. LMBO
user1: My mom refuses to watch it. She watched once, and say's no more. lol
user2: how come nobody likes these hits
user1: She hates every minute of it. Find's it depressing. Make's me wonder, if in her past, she dealt with a similar situation? lol
user2: There was another movie that did the same
user1: Not sure. I do lol-- So what did you think about the MOM calling NOAH trash?? And banning Allie from seeing him?
user2: Typical mother.. 
user2: She reminds me of mine
user2: Of course it back fires 
user1: Of course
user2: Than he breaks up, and starts dating emma stone
user2: wait wrong movie
user1: OMG LMBO
user1: We have to talk about Notebook NOT Lala Land haha
user1: What did you think Ryan's role?
user2: Think he was better in notebook than that new movie thats for sure
user2: The lumber accident was nice
user1: Agreed.
user1: Well i guess it's time to end the convo. Great movie though. have a nice night :)
user2: you too

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: hi
user1: like?
user2: what?
user1: the movie
user1: The Notebook
user2: is that the one with ryan gosling
user1: yes
user2: and rachel... whats her name
user1: mcadams
user2: ah
user1: yes
user1: nice
user2: yeah
user2: sappy
user1: love story
user1: good story
user1: yeah
user1: "Audiences craving big, gooey over-the-top romance have their must-see summer movie inThe Notebook."
user2: hmm
user2: lolz

conversation:
user1: I thought Gosling and McAdams had a real connection in real life and it made it believable in the movie! 
user2: do you think they gave an all star performance also?
user1: I do! I think they were fantastic.
user2: I thought they did a great job also, very interesting 
user2: did you enjoy both of them the same amount?
user1: Yes, I thought each character was very imperative
user2: I felt they both did a great job throughout the movie 
user1: I never read the book but I think the movie was worth the watch
user2: I never read the book either , but the movie was good
user1: I'm wondering how they gotten a rotten tomatoes percentage of 52. That surprises me because the people around me who saw it loved it. 
user2: I love carnivals, and its awesome that is were they first meet
user1: Yes, I felt that it was something that could actually play out in real life which is what made it so powerful for me. 
user2: I like how they get interrupted because the police are looking for her
user1: I'm reading the document and I think it's true when they state, "McAdams carries much of the film's emotional weight...." She had to because she was the girl, lol
user2: yeah Its interesting they point that out
user2: I also feel that The 1940's were an interesting time, a lot was going on 
user1: Yeah, it gives perspective on how they talked. How people interact with each other. How they dressed back then. 
user1: people "courted" each other then.
user1: That doesn't happen too often nowadays.
user1: It was a very emotional rollercoaster. Allie's parents ban her from seeing Noah. It rarely works like that anymore

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello. The movie we will be talking about is called The Notebook.
user1: Oh how interesting!
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: This movie has Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as main actors. They are known for their good acting skills.
user1: Yes I like them both! What are the ratings for this movie?
user2: The movie is about a young couple in the 1940s who fall in love. 
user2: The ratings are 52% on Rotten Tomatoes and a metacritic score of 53/100.
user1: Ok, No the highest ratings. I what part of the country does this take place?
user2: They are not the highest ratings, so it might not be a good movie to watch. This is an American film.
user1: What state does this take place in?
user1: What time of year does it take place in?
user2: This takes place in South Carolina. The main character, Noah falls in love with a 17 year old heiress named Allie. They have a summer love affair.
user1: How romantic! Do they continue their relationship after summer or do the end their relationship! Is there tragedy in the movie?
user2: Allie is prevented by her parents from seeing Noah further. The two get in an argument and break up.
user1: How sad! There must be a twist in the movie??
user1: What was the reason that the parents would not let them see each other?
user2: Allie's family ends up moving to Charleston. Allie's parents call Noah trash. Overall the critics say the movie is good for people craving over-the-top romance. It does have rather low ratings overall though.
user1: I see! There must have been some type of "class" difference. Or was it that Noah was truly "trash"?
user1: How long is the movie?
user2: I'm not sure. I do know though that Noah wrote letters to Allie daily for a year but Allie's mother intercepted them. Noah enlists in WWII and Allie becomes engaged to another man.
user1: Oh how sad! Who directs the movie?
user2: Nick Cassavetes. This movie is actually based on the 1996 novel The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. The story is narrated from present day by an elderly man telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident.
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user1: How interesting! So it is movie that is shot in third person narrative?? 
user1: It sound like the rating of the movie is rather low and I could understand. It sound like the movie is very slow!
user2: Maybe you can look that up online. The rating is rather low, but critics do say the main actors are suitably attractive and appealing.
user1: From what you have read, would you go see the movie?
user2: There are low ratings yet positive reviews from critics. I think I would give it a shot. What about you?
user1: From what you have written I would probably go see the movie. Did the paragraphs indicate when the movie was filmed?
user2: The movie was filmed 2004. Do you generally like romance movies?
user1: Yes to a degree! If they are to slow and "sappy" I will get bored! How about you? do you like romance movies?
user2: I agree. I like romance movies as long as they keep moving and aren't too over-the-top.
user1: I need to get back to work! It was nice chatting with you!!!

conversation:
user1: The Notebook is one of my all time favorite love story movies
user1: It really gave Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams their starting point into movie stardom
user2: Yes I think they both did a great job acting in the movie
user2: I almost didn't recognize Rachel McAdams
user1: Even better was that it followed the book very closely, unlike how most book to movie movies go. They kept it pretty true.
user2: That's good to know. I haven't read the book, but after seeing the movie I want to
user1: Its really good. Most of Nicholas Sparks' books to movies are like this. I have read a couple of his books and seen the movies.
user1: What was the part of the movie that got to you the most?
user2: After seeing this one I think I will watch some of the other movies adapted from his books.
user2: The scene at the end with Gena Rowlands and James Garner. How about you?
user1: That part made me cry. It is such a powerful scene. True loves until the end
user2: I agree
user2: It was an amazing movie
user1: It was. it was very well made. I would watch it again and again.
user2: It was my first time watching it, but I would definitely watch again
user1: Plus Noah's house! I love it. If I lived in South Carolina, thats the kind of house I would want
user2: I was amazed that an abandoned house could look like that

conversation:
user2: What's the name of the movie?
user1: The Notebook
user2: How long is it?
user1: I'd say it's an average length movie, about 2 hours
user2: Is the plot good?
user1: It's great! It's set in 1940 and tells the story of young love and how their lives grow.
user2: when did the movie originally come out?
user1: It was released in 2004.
user2: Did it get good reviews?
user1: It has above average reviews.
user2: I think I want to watch this movie.
user1: That's great! There's a great scene in it where the young couple meets at a carnival. 
user2: What happens at the carnival?
user1: That's where the 2 main characters meet. They start a summer romance while they are there.
user2: How does it end?
user1: I can't give away the ending! You'll have to see it!
user2: okay, okay haha
user2: How does it begin?
user1: It begins with them meeting at the carnival but Allie (the young lady in couple) is told by her parents that the man is trash and they take her away from him. He goes off to fight during WWII and writes her all the time. But Allie doesn't know because her mother hides the letters before she sees them.
user2: that's not very nice of her, how does she find out about him writing to her?
user1: A few years later Allie and Noah (the young man in the couple) run into each other.
user2: Where do they run into each other?
user1: After he comes home from the war, they run into each other while he is visiting Charleston SC. Allie lives there. 
user1: Allie then follows Noah back to the town where they first met, where Noah lives. And they start seeing each other again.
user2: Do they stay together from that point on?
user1: Allie, is currently engaged to another man but yes, she leaves him to be with Noah.
user2: Doesn't she end up losing her memory at the end?
user1: I don't like giving away endings! But wouldn't it be so sad if she did?
user2: yeah that would really suck!
user1: And her mom is a hypocrite! She tried to keep Allie from Noah because she had fallen in love with a man of lower class when she was younger and got hurt 

conversation:
user2: HI
user1: Hey!!!
user2: Did you see the Avengers?
user1: We're assigned The Notebook.
user1: The love story.
user2: Hmmm, that's weird, I selected Avengers. Anyway, yeah I've seen that one
user1: Have you ever seen it
user2: What did you like about it?
user2: Or dislike heh
user1: I like that they found love at such a young age
user2: Yeah, I saw it with my ex girlfriend haha
user2: I don't have particularly fond memories of it :D
user1: They were able to grow up with one another and live to an old age.
user1: They die together in the hospital due to old age at the end.
user2: Was there anything you didn't like about it though?
user1: I saw it with my boyfriend, who is now my husband!
user1: Heck no! I'm living that story now.
user2: Oh wow, really?
user2: Haha that's cool :)
user1: Dated my guy for 10 years and have been married for 10.

user1: You don't believe in true love, huh!?!
user1: Lol, yeah they have
user2: Well, yes sometimes but at times people have to go their own ways in life
user1: What did you like/ dislike about the movie?
user2: doesn't mean we don't love them heh
user2: Well, to be honest I'm not a huge romance guy :)
user2: But I liked the chemistry between the two people
user1: I get that, not too many guys are. 
user2: Allie and Noah
user2: Haha :)
user2: But also I thought that the cinematography was amazing
user1: I did too. One of my favorite parts is when they are at the ocean and Noah asks Allie what she is and she says, I'm a bird.
user2: Lol!
user1: And he says back, well, If you're a bird I'm a bird too!
user1: Ahh, now that is how you know someone loves you
user2: Hahah, the dialogue in the film makes it
user2: Lol!!
user1: It does, so romantic! 
user2: I need to rewatch it :), I think I'll try to stream it later
user2: Does your husband like it?
user1: I think he tolerates it for me. 
user1: Now I want to rewatch it too! Lol
user2: My ex absolutely loved it - it's really not that bad if you have an open mind :)
user1: No it is not!Hey, thanks for chatting with me! =)
user2: Thank you too!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hey
user2: What movie are we supposed to discuss?
user1: The Note Book
user2: oh, okay. I've seen that one. But it was a while back. I can;t really remember how it ended
user1: yes it came out  in 2004
user2: Yeah, I know it is a sad romance. but I can't remember too many details about it. Can you?
user1: It was based on a 1996 novel by Nicholas Sparks.
user2: How did it end?
user1: they died in their sleep together.
user2: I hate movies that end like that. I think that is Nicholas Sparks' specialty
user1: Same here, I agree
user2: What is your favorite movie genre?
user1: I like more Drama movies
user1: Like urban stories
user2: I'm more into action. What was the last movie you saw in theaters?
user1: Last movie I saw was 50 Shades Freed
user2: I wanted to see that one. Was it any good? The last one I saw was Black Panther
user1: It was okay, a lot more action in this one.
user1: Yea I still need to see it.
user2: It was so good. and yeah I liked the first 50 shades movie but the second one was kind of boring. I was hoping the third was better than both of them
user1: Yea I think this was the last one, so no more after that.
user1: Most movies come from novels, like this one.
user2: Yeah, and now I'm looking forward to seeing Red Sparrow with Jennifer Lawrence. Have you heard of that one?
user1: No I haven't, what is it about>
user2: It's about a girl that gets recruited to this "Sparrow" program that trains gifted young women to become spies and master decption. It's supposed to be really good. I think that's what its about but I could be worng
user1: Sounds interesting, I've not sure I know who Jennifer Lawrence is
user1: What other movies have she played in?
user2: Have you ever seen the hunger games?
user1: No, but I know it's very popular.
user1: Is that where she's from?
user2: Yes she stars in that series
user2: I prefer movies like that then movies like the notebook
user2: I don't think I'll watch that one again 
user1: I will give it a look, 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!  I LOVE this movie! Do you?
user2: I did like it! I usually like Dramtic with romance movie
user2: and thought this one was pretty good
user1: I do too! I'm not sure how the rating is so low, I would think a lot of people would appreciate this movie!
user2: I know! The Rotten Tomatoes score is 52%
user2: thats a pretty low score
user1: That's crazy!
user2: And the Metacritic score is also low
user2: 53/100 
user1: It really is!  Whoever rated low must not have been much of a romantic haha.  
user2: Im sure the movie should be at least a 85/100 
user2: yeah lol
user2: they must have hated romance
user1: I couldn't agree more!  This movie would make for a great date night though, well, at least for the girl. lol
user1: What did you think of Ryan Gosseling's performance in the movie?
user2: I liked his role as Noah Calhoun I thought it was a pretty well acted
user2: what about you?
user2: did you like his performance
user1: I agree ,I really like it too.  I don't know if they could have picked a better actor.  He came off well as both young and wild but then later on as thoughtful and romantic as well. 
user2: Yeah I agree, what about Joan Allen?
user2: did you like her?
user1: Oh man, she was fantastic! What are your thoughts?
user2: I liked her acting as well but liked James Marsden better
user1: Did you have a favorite part in the movie?
user2: Overall I think the cast of the movie was great 
user1: I couldn't agree more!
user2: my favorite part is when Noah returns from war, 
user1: That part made me cry!
user2: what about yours
user2: what was your favorite scene
user2: and yeah it was a touchy scene
user1: I really liked the boat scene for some reason.  It may not have been the best part, but it was so dramatic!  The rain just really made that scene something special!
user2: Yeah it was a good scene, what do you think of the critic responses to the movie
user1: Well, I agree that it is "must see" for those who enjoy mushy-gushy love stories. 
user2: I think that they dont really fit the rating given by rotten tomatoes and Metacritic Score, the critic responses put the movie in a better light
user2: I agree with them as well
user1: You're right about that.  The critic responses are much more positive and ACCURATE!
user2: Yeah! well the movie deserves it. 

conversation:
user2: I absolutely love Ryan Gosling!
user2: He’s such a good actor.
user1: Really? What's the name of his movie?
user2: The Notebook
user2: It was a summer romance type movie
user1: Ok, sounds interesting.
user1: Any intense love scenes mentioned?
user2: Do you like the genre of movies?
user1: Yeah I don't mind that genre.
user1: And you?
user2: It’s also a drama, which I don’t always enjoy.
user2: Sometimes that genre makes for sad movies.
user1: Yeah, I agree with you there.
user1: What is The Notebook about?
user2: Teenagers that fall in love and have to overcome obstacles that get in their way.
user1: Sounds like high school drama.
user2: Apparently it’s set in the 1940’s, which I didn’t know.
user1: For most teenager couples.
user2: I think it would appeal to a young crowd.
user1: Is the relationship of these teenagers interracial?
user2: Especially wit( the actors in it.
user1: Was racial segregation one of the main obstacles they had to overcome?
user2: It doesn’t mention that, at least that I see.
user2: It says that a character goes off to war.
user1: Which character? 
user1: The main character perhaps?
user2: Ryan Goslings character apparently buys his love interest a house.
user1: Wow, how thoughtful. 
user2: Yes, it says Noah.  That is Ryan Gosling’s character.
user1: Sounds like a good movie.
user2: I wonder how many people saw this movie while it was in the theater?
user2: Yes!
user2: Nice talking with you.  Take care!
user1: You too!

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: Hi, Batman Return movie seem to be average one according to the rating. Do you agree? 
user1: Hi, Batman Return movie seem to be average one according to the rating. Do you agree? It had pretty good cast: Ryan Gosling, Joan Allen, and the rest. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi! Have you seen any good movies lately?
user2: No, I feel like movies are just getting worse and worse - how about you?
user1: Well generally I enjoy movies. They give me a break from reality.
user2: I can appreciate that. Have you ever seen the movie, The Notebook?
user1: I haven't seen that one yet.
user1: Who stars in it?
user2: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. They both do a fantastic job, but I think the real power of that movie comes from the story itself. If you want an escape from reality, that's the movie to check out.
user1: Hmm I do like both of those actors. Can you tell me a little about the plot?
user2: Without ruining it, all I can say is that it's a love story set in the 1940's.
user1: That sounds like a very interesting movie. Do the actors get along well?
user2: That's what's great about it, in a way they get a long, but there is also a lot of tension there because of events that happen in the movie.
user1: It sounds like it's dramatic. I do like those sort of movies. How does the supporting cast work ini t?
user2: The supporting cast is good. Everything fits into place nicely, James Marsden, and Joan Allen. I don't want to ruin anything by telling you too much about their roles, but they all give respectable performances. 
user1: I can understand that. What's the general setting of the movie?
user2: It's set most in South Carolina, and you can feel the southern warmth it has. Honestly, when my girlfriend first told me a about the movie, I wasn't all that interested in it, because typically I don't like romance movies, but this one got me.
user1: That sounds more pleasant than the nice freezing weather I'm experiencing here. How long is it?
user2: It's been a while since I've seen the movie, and I can't remember the actual run time, but I think it's a little bit longer than a normal movie. The thing is, when it ends, you don't want it to end, so... it doesn't feel too long or anything.
user1: Oh I love movies like that really drawing you in. Are there any musical numbers in it or other special events?
user2: Honestly, every event in it has meaning. But, I don't want to ruin anything by walking you through it. All I can say is that everything fits together nicely. 
user1: So it's kind of like a complicated puzzle movie? This is really sounding intriguing!
user2: I wouldn't really call it a puzzle. It's there is nothing that you have to really figure out as you watch it, but it is very dramatic, and events do drive the story. 
user1: Well it sounds like there's different pieces that all do have to work together. So it's not just a very simple love story.
user2: Exactly. There are elements from family members meddling, and how that impacts the development, and why the meddling is thought to be necessary. 
user1: lol that sounds like it would make for an interesting and very thorough movie. So everybody is able to all fit together in such a short time?
user2: Yeah everything makes perfect sense. Surprisingly it comes off as very heartfelt, and it's easy to understand everyone's perspective.  
user1: Well I can understand how a good ensemble cast can really work together and a good scriptwriter can certainly incorporate a number of people into one movie.
user2: Yeah, I guess this movie was based off a book, so everything has been really thought out.
user2: Do you think you'll watch it?
user1: It can confusing with movies based off books. Sometimes they can be really good but other times they can be really bad.
user1: Yes I'll probably check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!

conversation:
user1: Hello! 
user2: Howdy. What did you think of Ryan Gosling?
user1: Love him.
user1: and Rachel McAdams, how about you?
user2: Me too. I don't like her. Hate her actually. 
user2: Especially in this movie.
user1: At least she moved you..even if it is hate. Did you like this move in general? 
user2: Yeah it was good, I guess.
user2: Did you like it?
user1: It is a long watch, didn't like it as much as I thought I would. 
user2: I can't last more than 2 hours tops on any movie before I fall asleep, lol.
user2: Did you think the movie was better than rotten tomatoes says it is?
user1: I would rate about the same.
user2: What did you think of the script?
user2: I liked it.

Although at first Allie is not interested in him, Noah insists that he spends time together and as he and Allie fall in love.
user1: oh okay so its a romantic movie(chick flick)?

user1: very good point. Would you watch it?
user2: I consider myself a romantic lover, I think if I would
user1: oh okay good to know. I am not super romantic so I'm not sure I would watch it.

user1: What kind of movie is it?
user2: Its a romantic drama
user2: it stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAmams
user2: oops, McAdams
user1: Oh, interesting. I like those people. Does it have a happy ending?
user2: I'm not sure about that
user1: When does it take place?
user2: In the 1940's
user2: it's based in SC
user1: Hmmm. What year did the movie come out?
user2: 2004
user2: it starts as a summer romance
user1: Then what happens?
user2: her mother doesn't approve of him
user1: Sounds dramatic
user2: i agree
user1: Would males and females like watching this movie?
user2: it's probably better suited to females
user2: but I don't want to be sexist. I'm sure there are plenty of men who would enjoy this film also
user1: did it win any awards or anything?
user1: I'm sure. i don't take offense. 
user2: good question.  I'm not sure that it got any awards
user1: are they any sad parts? will i cry?
user2: i think you might
user2: apparently the mother interferes in their romance to the point of nearly ruining it
user1: I don't know if i like crying movies. How long is it?
user1: sounds like i'll hate the mother then.
user2: yes i believe so. She even hides the letters that he writes to her from the army
user1: do they end up together in the end or does someone die?
user1: OMG!
user1: that's awful
user2: it is! She volunteers at a hospital where she meets another guy and falls for him, becoming engaged. Guess this guy is from money and is ok with mom\
user1: was it well received at the box office? 
user2: yes for sure
user2: i think they end up together tho
user1: what would the age range of the viewership be for the notebook
user1: ?
user2: hm hard to say, but guess it's appropriate for any adults and teens
user1: ok cool
user2: ya... you should probably try to see it on Netflix or something
user1: so it's on netflix?

user1: I was worried, I was talking to myself. Falling in love in the 1940s, I wonder what that was like. seems like an interesting movie. 
user2: haha my bad its my first time(; I know right seems like those were the days.
user1: You know the sooner you respond the sooner we can be done:) But the ratings are not so good though 52%. I wonder why.
user2: yea maybe the actors didn't do very good?
user1: The story is narrated by an elderly man.
user2: yea that problobly gears it to an elderly audience
user1: It described as a must see summer movie hmmm!
user2: yea I saw that gooey and over the top
user1: Actors are blessed by good material! I doubt it
user2: yea every every movie needs some comedy....
user1: The ratings are disappointing.
user2: ye only 5 stars out of 10
user1: But the critical response seems to say it's a must see movie. 
user2: yea it doea at THt
user1: I rarely cry but critical response says everybody cries that watches the movie. Makes me want to see what's all about.
user2: yea the hype is big but the ratings are low
user1: It's super old though. Based off of 1996 novel. That seems like a long time ago.
user2: yea the times have changed so much
user1: I have never heard of the actors. Do you know any of them? 
user2: I have no idea who they are
user1: 17 seems so young for a love affair
user2: yea back then that was probloby pretty normal
user1: But I guess those were the old days.
user2: i guess it love
user1: Wow Noah wrote to Allie everyday for a whole yeah. That's super romantic. 
user2: agreed that love!!!

conversation:
user1: Do you know what other movies Ryan Gosling played in?
user2: The Believer. Do you know what other movies Rachel McAdams was known for?
user1: No, do you know?
user1: Does he remind you of Warren Beatty?
user2: Yes he does and she reminds me of Natalie Wood.
user2: Do you think this is more of a romance or comedy?

conversation:
user2: Hi, Ive actually seen this movie a while back. I liked it, even though it is a chick flick and I am a boy
user1: I haven't seen it, I usually avoid this type of movie
user2: Why is that?
user2: Too depressing? 
user1: I don't like movies that make me cry lol
user2: I agree haha
user2: I like comedies and action
user1: I agree
user2: For how many females like this movie, I am very surprised at the ratings from Rotten Tomatoe and Metaric Score
user2: I would have expected it to do better. Mainly because of 2 famous actors and its success over the years.
user1: I was surprised by that as well.  So many of my friends loved this movie when it came out
user2: Ya, which makes me question those rating websties anyways.
user2: I have seen so many movies that I love and those websites rate them so low. So i am starting to ignore reviews now
user1: me too, I usually just watch movies that people recommend to me
user1: the document does mention that the script is "sticky-sweet" so maybe that's where the movie went wrong
user2: haha ya probably 
user2: It was a bit cheesy
user2: Not going to lie though, made me a bit sad lol
user2: the ending is pretty messed up 
user1: I do like Rachel McAdams though she is great
user2: so I dont like those movies. Id rather be happy
user2: Ya agreed! Shes great, very sweat 
user1: I hate sad endings...
user2: sweet*
user1: that is why I don't want to see it!
user2: Ya unless you want to be depressed, dont watch it haha
user2: Have you seen her in MEan Girls?
user2: That is a great movie
user1: I do like the history in it though
user1: yes, it is really funny
user2: Like it says in the document, McAdams played the role of a bitch in mean girls and in this movie she is such a sweetheart haha. 
user2: Which comes to show how good of an actress she is
user1: definitely..I feel like Ryan Gosling sort of always plays the same character though...
user2: Ya agreed. 
user2: the only one that is a bit different is Drive
user2: other than that its mostly drama movies lol
user1: I see that this movie takes place in Charleston, that is such a beautiful city.  A perfect setting for a romance movie
user2: Ya agreed haha
user2: It is very beautiful
user2: I remember the house in the movie very clearly
user2: Very beautiful setting
user2: Ive never been to South Carolina, but I bet it is beautiful
user1: I have never read any of Nicholas Sparks books or seen any of his movies, lol
user2: Neither have I

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you?
user1: Hello, I am great! How are you!?
user1: Do you like Romantic Comedies?
user2: Fine thank you! I love that genre!
user1: Have you seen The Notebook?
user1: It stars Ryan Gosling, he is super cute!!
user2: Yes I have and he really is. Now I sort of recall the movie being real cheesy. Was it?
user1: I honestly didn't think so, I enjoyed it. But I love this genre anyway
user1: Did you know it was based on a novel?
user1: I read it, it is great as well!
user2: Would you say there book was better or the opposite?
user1: I think they both were equally great, but I really enjoyed the movie more.
user1: And Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are not bad to look at.
user2: Oh wow! Maybe I should watch it again. Who is the leading lady
user1: I also enjoyed the fact the movie was set in the 1940's although being told in today's time.
user1: Rachel McAdams, she's gorgeous!
user1: Have you heard of the director Nick Cassavetes, I believe he is pretty good as well.
user2: Oh yeah cause her character was sick and he was telling her their past. What rating did this film get?
user1: Critics say McAdams gave an all star performance!
user1: But the rotten tomatoes score is only 52%
user1: The Metacritic score is 53/100
user2: Aww! I guess it’s about how the audience film. It’s becoming a classic anyway
user1: There are still great critic responses
user1: Definitely a classic, and I can't imagine many girls who won't fall in love
user2: Lol! How would you rank this amongst other romantic films?
user1: The movie is set in Seabrook Island in South Carolina
user1: Hmmm good question!
user1: I would have to say it is in my top five for sure!
user2: His films always need to be set in some unknown beautiful land btw
user1: It came out in 2004 and has been on my list ever since!
user1: Right, totally agree!
user2: Any romantic film that beat it?
user2: From being the number one?
user1: Now that I think about it, no! I may watch it again tonight!
user1: Noah wrote Allie every day for a year, how romantic is that!?
user2: Lol! That’s so delightful! Almost like a Disney fairytale!
user1: Too bad she never got the letters thanks, but yes it's such a fairytale!
user1: Then Allie and Noah finally get back together in the old house and make love!
user1: It's so sweet!
user2: Better than the love scene from the Titanic!?
user1: Comparable, but n my opinion, yes! What do you think?
user1: in*
user1: I'm also glad this fairytale ends with them together!
user1: Would have broken my heart for them to break up!
user2: Yah! They still stuck with each other so point 1 for the Notebook

conversation:
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: Hello, how are you?  I have seen this movie.
user2: Great, you? I have seen it too. 
user2: It's one of my favorite go to movies when it's rainy out.
user1: What was your impression of the movie?
user2: I Loved the development of the relationship between the characters. How about you?
user1: I did too, although I grew frustrated at the back and forth dynamic coupled with the "spoiled rich girl persona" that McAdams carried throughout the film.
user1: I'm glad she finally gave in.
user2: I agree completely! I really thought she'd end up sticking it out and staying with who she was "supposed to" because that was the right thing to do but she didn't.
user2: Other than that I found much of it predictable in the sense of movie storylines.
user2: I thought Gosling did a great job of promoting displays of emotion from male leads. What do you think?
user1: The ending made me incredibly sad.....I've had too much personal experience with dementia and what it can do between family members who were once connected so strongly.  It is devastating to those that are mentally left behind.
user1: He really works his way into your heart, doesn't he?
user2: Yeah it is. I used to work in the Alzheimer's ward at a nursing home. I've seen it firsthand but never had it in my family. He was so tender and loving. He's definitely a fan favorite for women!
user1: I'm forgetting who the male lead is later in the movie.......he is incredible though.  I also worked in a nursing home with Alzheimer's patients.  Interesting!
user2: Oh the old man version of him. Yes. I don't recall his name either but he was amazing! I cannot imagine what i would do in his shoes but he captured unconditional love completely.
user1: James Garner......that's it.
user2: I love also that it was set in the south which in my mind is an ideal location for a drama/romance film.
user1: I agree.  Not much romance takes place up here, in Minnesota.
user1: Too cold!
user2: Not much here in Nebraska either. I couldn't imagine it being set here.
user1: Is there anything about the film that you would have changed?  Plotline?  Characters?
user2: I cannot remember who played her mother but I remember thinking she wasn't right for the part.
user2: And to be honest I likely would have st it back just a tiny bit more in history maybe in the 1920s?
user2: Joan Allen.. that's right.
user1: That would have been more historically interesting, for sure.  Their relationship seemed to be a little volatile for my taste, at times.  I remember a couple of times in the movie when McAdams's character physically assaulted Gosling's character when they were in conflict.
user2: I had forgotten about that! You are right. 
user1: Passion doesn't have to hurt! :)
user2: How did you feel when you found out that Allie's Mom was intercepting the letters?
user1: I think in that situation I would have disowned my mother, or at least distanced myself from her for a GREAT while.  That was the ultimate betrayal of a daughter by an unhappy mother in an unfulfilling relationship herself.  She didn't know what real love was, so she assumed that she knew what was best for her daughter.  
user2: I think I would have likely reacted the same way. Do you think that somewhere deep inside she really did think she was doing the right thing?
user1: She might have been thinking about Allie's physical welfare, but she neglected to think about her emotional well being.  That is ultimately most important.
user1: I found it incredibly sweet that Noah finished the house to Allie's specifications, and that he'd spent years doing it.  That was truly a labor of love.
user2: Yep. I agree. How awesome is that his father made that possible? I couldn't imagine that kind of gift. His father was a true romantic. That's probably where Noah got it from.
user1: That was great, I agree.
user2: While I don't agree with cheating on her fiance, I do love how the movie ended.
user2: True love prevails!
user1: I almost found myself having to shut that off; I had so much strong emotion going on at that point I could not handle watching those birds gliding across the lake.  I was crying like a baby.
user1: True love lasts even after we shuffle off this mortal coil.......
user2: Yes!

conversation:
user1: Hi, How are you?
user2: Fine.  And you?
user2: Have you seen The Notebook?
user1: I'm great. I was just going to ask you the name of the movie. No, I haven't seen this one.
user2: It may be interesting.  Do you like romantic drama?
user1: Sometimes, when it is not overly "mushy"
user1: Who are the actors?

conversation:
user1: The reviews on this movie seem to be quite good, but the ratings seem low.  
user2: Yeah, how weird. I really liked it.
user1: I agree.  I thought it was really good also.  I thought Rachel McAdams was very good.
user2: She was great. Completely different from Mean Girls. What did you think of Gosling?
user1: I thought he was very good as well.  He was very convincing and charming.
user2: I agree!
user1: James Garner was the best though.  What did you think of him?
user2: He broke my heart. Gena Rowlands did too. Did you find their storyline depressing?
user1: I wouldn't say depressing, necessarily.  To me, it was more heart breaking as well.
user2: I guess that's true. Do you think the movie was an accurate portrayal of the 1940s?
user1: I think the movie did a good job, but Gosling and McAdams seemed a little odd at first for that time frame.  I think they pulled it off though.  This was definitely a tear-jerker movie for me.  What did you think?
user2: I'm embarassed to admit that I cried two times. Did you cry when they got separated?
user1: For me, it was more so for the scenes in the nursing home when you discover the issues between Garner and Rowlands.
user2: Yeah, that was so devastating. But on a scale of 1 to 10, how much did you hate Allie's mother?
user1: Yah, that's hard to judge.  Do you normally watch movies that were from Nicholas Sparks books?
user2: Nope. What about you?
user1: I loved the fact that Noah finished the house for Allie.  What did you think?
user2: I didn't like that. Noah was too obsessive. Were you super sad when Fin died?
user1: I thought that was sad, along with the fact that Allie became engaged to Lon during that time.  
user2: I didn't mind them together, actually. Do you like movies with love triangles?
user1: Sometimes, but generally love triangles frustrate me.  lol  I really didn't like Allie's mom.  Do you think Joan Allen played the part well?
user2: She was great! There wasn't any bad acting in this movie, was there?
user1: Not at all!  Everyone was great.  I was glad to see though that Anne gave Allie the letters.  Did that make you like her a little bit more?
user2: I definitely felt for her! Do you think it was right for Allie to ditch Lon?
user1: I think she would've been unhappy in the long run had she stayed with Lon, so it was good to go back to Noah.   Do you think she should have stayed with Lon?
user2: No. Allie and Noah should have ended up together. 
user1: I also really enjoyed the scenery of Seabrook and Charleston in the movie.  What do you think of the way they showed South Carolina in the movie?
user2: Very quaint. I think they did an okay job portraying South Carolina. Unrelated, but have you seen any other films written by Jeremy Leven?

user2: Are you into watching American romantic dramas?
user1: Sure, why not? What is the name of a good one?
user2: This film stars ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, are you familiar with them?
user1: Yes, I am. It is an older film?
user2: 2004, Would you consider that an old film?
user1: Not new, but not an older one. What is the film about?
user2: A young couple who fall in love in teh 1940's.
user1: That sounds like it could be interesting. Have you seen the movie?
user2: This story is narrated from the present day by an elderly many telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident. 
user1: I think this is a sad romantic movie? I forget the name, but I think I have read the book...
user2: It is the Notebook
user1: Oh, yes. That is the name. Are there other famous actors in the movie?
user2: Sure! Joan Allen plays the part of Anne Hamilton and James Marsden plays Lon Hammond, Jr. 
user1: I wonder if this movie has won any awards?
user2: I'm not certain that it has. I do know Rotten Tomatoes gave it an average rating of 5/7/10
user1: That seems pretty good. Is it a very long movie? 
user2: I don't think it is a very long movie, but I'm not certain of the exact time
user1: Have you seen the movie? Or if you have not, do you think you would enjoy it?

user2: Uh, no I haven't, what's it about?

conversation:
user1: Hello! Have you ever seen The Notebook?
user2: I have not. Have you?
user2: Would you recommend it? 
user1: Yes, I have. It was a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys romantic films. Are you familiar with any of the actors? Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, Joan Allen, or James Marsden?
user2: It's not really my chosen genre for film - to be honest, I read the book, and like stories that don't leave me crying. I did enjoy Rachel McAdams in Dr. Strange.
user1: I've never read the book. I know it's by Nicholas Sparks, who happens to be one of my favorite authors. Although you don't like stories that leave you crying, I would still suggest watching it. It really is a great film all the way around in my opinion. I also really like the fact that it's narrated by someone else who is re-telling the story to a nursing home resident. That really sparked my interest.
user2: A frame story, so to speak. It gives a good perspective to the plot.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1: I'm okay. How are you?
user2: What movie are we discussing today? I didn't receive the movie title. 
user1: The Notebook
user1: Have you seen it?
user1: It's a tear jerker
user2: And I'm good by the way :)
user1: :)
user2: I have heard so much about it though pop culture, but I've never seen it. 
user1: It's a romantic drama.
user2: Have you?
user1: Yes, it has been years since I've watched it though.
user1: It's about a couple who fall in love in the 1940's.
user1: Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man telling the story to a fellow resident in the nursing home. 
user2: What do you think about it?
user1: It was a good movie.
user1: It's based on a book.
user1: The book was written by Nicholas Sparks. I've never read it
user2: It sounds good, but I'm not a big fan of romantic dramas.
user2: Are you?
user1: not necessarily, but it was still a good movie.
user1: I don't really like watching movies that make me cry.
user2: I didn't even realize it was based on a book.
user2: Are you a fan of Nicholas Sparks' books?
user1: I'd imagine there are a lot of differences in the book and movie. 
user1: I've never read any of his books. 
user2: Did you cry a lot while watching the movie?
user1: Yes, I did. lol  I'm a cry baby sometimes
user2: Did the movie make you cry because it was sad or touching?
user1: Both, love stories can be both and this was one of them. 
user2: Do you prefer romantic dramas like the notebook or romantic comedies more?
user1: I'd say romantic comedies. I love to laugh.
user1: What about you?

conversation:
user2: hei
user1: hello
user2: Do you like romance movies?
user1: I do like romance movies and I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. How about you?
user2: I Have not seen it before but the ratings are quite low
user2: 5.7/10
user2: oh well, I like them when there is a bit of comedy attached 
user1: That is fairly low but I find that I tend to enjoy most movies more than the critics. 
user2: good on you. means u will know how to love and treat and woman right,,,hahaha
user2: the director nick cassavetes , i dont know him
user2: do u know any other movie he directed?
user1: I don't know him either. I don't think I've heard his name before.
user2: hahaha maybe thats why d ratings are low
user2: so the movie is about a young couple that fell in love in the 40s
user1: yeah that could be lol. I never realized this was based on a book. Might need to read that since the books are always better.
user1: Yes, the couple falls in love in the 40's in South Carolina.
user1: Do you like ryan gosling as an actor. He's a very handsome man
user1: Are you still here?
user2: I think it tiring reading a book though..
user2: u have any special thing that makes u hooked on reading?
user2: *tip
user2: So in the movie..mother advises son to break up with his sweet heart..and he does..lol
user2: hi are u there?
user1: yes. The conversation is loading strange. It is lagging badly.
user1: The mother seems like she's a bit pushy to me.
user1: Not sure what else to say about the movie.
user2: yes im here ...
user2: i think it might be my connection
user2: really bad
user2: but anyways..the chat will end soon
user2: lets just hand on for a while
user2: But the main character Ryan Gosling seem to be a popular name
user2: let me google him and see 
user1: He wrote to her ever day for a year...I can't write one letter a year let alone one per day.
user1: I'm no expert on love or anything but wouldn't it have been easier to just say the words "I love you" to her rather than taking all that time to restore a house.
user2: i would say its not worth watching 
user2: wow really?..everyday for a year..thats crazy
user2: Guess wrote I wrote a love letter on the 14th...I just felt like pouring my heart out the old fashion way and she loved it..so i can just imagine someone writing everyday for one year
user2: I know right 
user2: oh well, sometimes what is destined to be ..no matter what you say if it's bound to fail it will fail. if the story were real..lets just say he tried but thats how fate wanted it for them
user1: Nice job on the letter. yeah seems like the whole thing could have been 5 minutes long if the parents minded their own business and Noah spoke his feelings.
user1: That next part is great. Allie shows up and says nice house, let's sleep together. 
user1: The relationship resolution between lon and allie seems odd. She already slept with noah but she's still indecisive about who to be with.
user1: It's been about 10 minutes since I got a message from you. Are you still here?
user1: I don't think we can finish this unless we respond to each other. 
user1: well i guess I lost you....the movie wasn't that bad lol
user1: kind of lonely in here
user1: I don't really care for the ending of this movie because it makes the woman seem weak and like she has to have a man

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: hi there
user1: The Notebook is hands-down one of my favorite movies EVER!
user2: I think mind is trading places
user1: Have you ever seen The Notebook?
user2: No I have never seen this movie. I am going tod try it out now
user1: It was a heartwarming story of young love.  The main characters are played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.
user2: Ok this sounds nice. I think Ryan is a good actor
user1: For all the praise it received, I was surprised to see that it only got a 5.7/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.  
user2: That is interesting. They never get the rating correct.
user1: Ryan is a great actor, as well as Rachel McAdams.  The story goes back and forth between present day and the past.  Older Ryan is played by James Garner and older Rachel is played by Gena Rowlands.
user1: Yeah, Rotten Tomatoes never gets the right ratings..LOL
user1: I always like to see the ratings but if I want to see a movie, I will watch it even if it has a bad rating.
user2: I think I  am the same way and I will watch it no matter what.
user1: One of the best scenes in the movie (without spoiling anything) is a big fight that Ryan and Rachel have one night when her parents couldn't find her and they have the police search for them.
user2: ok
user2: what happen
user1: Do you want me to spoil it?  LOL

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: So, what is the movie we are to talk about? I cannot see it at the moment.
user1: Hi. The Notebook is the film available at this time. 
user2: Cool. Have you ever seen it?
user1: I believe so. How about you? 
user2: I have. I disliked it, but I bet it got good ratings.
user1: Surprisingly no. At least not according to Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. 
user2: What were the ratings?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it 52% and 5.7/10. Metacritic Score was 53/100. It was a romance film so maybe males just didn't dig it as much?
user2: Yes, and I think it just wasn't an overall good movie that made much of a difference.
user1: It had Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in it so I'm a little surprised it wasn't rated better. The info given doesn't really match those scores either though. The critical responses are mostly positive.
user2: I remember watching it and finding it corny. 
user1: It says it was set in the 1940's. I don't think I did see it.
user2: Yes, I'm not sure if there was a point to setting it there either. It didn't really factor into anything. 
user1: The key scenes set it in 1940's South Carolina. He falls for her at the fair. It sounds like she was rich and he maybe wasn't.
user2: Yes, that's what it is. Who was the director?
user1: Nick Cassavetes. Are you familiar with him?
user2: No, I don't know him
user1: It was based on the book of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. 
user2: That is interesting
user1: I see now that it was narrated sort of as a flashback from present day. James Garner was in it as well. Quite the cast to get such bad ratings.
user2: He did a good job
user1: New scene info here describes Noah writing Allie but her never getting them. He then went to war. While he was gone she met a richer guy that her parents liked. So it was rich girl/poor boy. I could see how that was cheesy.
user2: Yes, it definitely was. Anything else interesting about the film?
user1: Eventually she finds out about the letters. A relative had been intercepting them. She eventually was given them and they rekindle a relationship.
user2: Yeah, and there is that other guy too. She just goes for a new guy then goes back to her old guy.
user1: I wonder what else Nick Cassavetes has directed. It doesn't say here. Information is limited.
user1: I was thinking it was really sad as well. None of that is portrayed here in the scenes they describe.
user2: I wish I could add more
user1: Ah, the critics did hit on that a little. They say Gosling and McAdams do just enough to hand the film off to the "pros" that don't leave a dry eye in the house. 

conversation:
user1: Did you ever see The Notebook?
user2: Hello, Not completely 
user2: Some parts
user1: same. I am relaly not sure i seen the entire thing. I know the basics tho- mainly it's a love story lol
user1: I didn't realize this movie was so old. the doc says it came out in 2004
user2: Yeah? Who are the starring?
user1: Ryan gosling, rachel mcadms
user1: So many people love ryan gosling 
user1: i'm not too much of a fan.  the lady doesn't seem to get as much hype as he did in the movie
user1: I forgot this was a book by Nicholas Sparks. I might read it if and when I ever get time. 
user2: I see. But tell Does it has a happy ending?
user2: tell me*
user1: let me see if the doc tells that because i can't remember
user2: lol I know, take your time 
user1: I think i remember that it does. SO far the doc does not tell me
user2: great, but tell me more about the movie. What else do you know>
user1: Apparently the story is based on characters that are in a nursing home currently (they narate it I guess)
user2: It sounds boring. What else do you know buddy?
user1: hahah it really does sound boring lol
user1: I didn't know that the female was in Mean Girls lol
user2: Wow, Really? Oh yeah I remember
user1: im surprised. they say that her character was way different in this movie then mean girls- and i agree on that for sure
user2: Ha ha ha I guess the movie is interesting 
user2: but I should watch it my girl
user1: i think so
user1: in fact i think i need to watch it again
user2: or I'll be fallen asleep in less than half second
user1: hahaha!  true
user1: that happens to me in pretty much any movie! i cant sit still like that lol
user2: So do you?
user1: yeah
