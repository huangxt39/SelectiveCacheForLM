critical response:
Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle
In one of Jim Carrey's best films he plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter that nurses hopes of one day becoming an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor.

Tom Shadyac

description:
Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. He is in a relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from an unaired segment by Bruce while accepting the promotion on air. 
Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering the body of Jimmy Hoffa, earning him his job back, or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off. Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her about his promotion (disappointing her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them. Bruce creates an e-mail system to receive prayers and respond to them - but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle, even with the use of his powers. So he sets the program to automatically answer 'Yes' to every prayer, thinking this will make everyone happy. 
God appears and tells Bruce to pray for what he truly wants; Bruce prays for Grace to find a man that would make her happy. God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being miraculously revived by the doctors. Grace arrives and the two reconcile. After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field of reporting, but takes more pleasure, in simple stories. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live television. The film ends with a homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages that Bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be God.

user1: hey, what was your fav scene of the movie
user1: yes
user2: Hello, I have just seen the film. It is hilarious don't you think? Jim Carrey is very funny.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi.  Bruce Almighty is the movie we will be talking about.  It is a comedy starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman.
user1: Have you seen this movie before?  I have seen this back when it first came out!
user2: I have.  It's very funny. Carrey is hilarious and I love Morgan Freeman.
user1: Yes, Jim Carrey was much more hilarious back in the days.  Morgan Freeman will always be the sound of "God" to me.
user1: Would you rewatch the movie?
user2: Honestly.  I love Freeman's voice.  Jennifer Anniston was also very good.  But I did feel sorry for her character.
user2: Yes, Bruce Almighty is one of my go-to movies.
user2: The cinemascore for this movie is an A.  I'm not surprised at all to hear that.  All of the actors did a fabulous job.
user1: Yes I feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her Friends days.
user1: I do not think I would rewatch this movie.
user2: Yes, I agree that her character was very much a Friends style role.'
user2: Oh??  Why not?  Do you not like comedies?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes has a rotten score for it, so I think i am swayed by that.
user2: Oh but the CinemaScore is an A.
user1: Comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that I have favored in awhile.
user2: Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.
user1: Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles
user1: However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years
user2: Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.
user2: And Jim Carrey has bombed in so many.  But he outdid himself in this movie.
user1: It seems like I will have to rewatch it in the end.  
user2: I like how he uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events'
user2: I don't like how he embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character Evan was such an ass.
user1: Lol, very true.  It sure makes the situation crazier that it should be 
user2: I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'
user1: Likewise, I kind of wish I had his powers so I could do the same lol
user2: And of course, God  (Morgan Freeman) steps in to save the day and tells Bruce what he should do.
user1: Seriously!  Did you know it knocked off The Matrix Reloaded from the box office during its first week?
user2: Noooo I didn't know that.  I enjoyed the first Matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the  hit the first one was.  Saying that I can see why it knocked it out of it's place.
user2: When it all comes down to it, this is one of my favorite movies.  I'm not a big movie fan but this is one I can rewatch many times.
user1: True that.  Pretty impressive for Jim Carrey's career!  I hope you didn't watch Evan Almighty lol

user1: when he brought the moon close to her

user1: n wen he made her boobs big with her knowing
user2: did jennifer aniston know that he has god powers? I do not remember that part
user1: not at first she didnt
user2: I like the way he was responding the prayers by email :)
user1: i think he told her tho i cant remember
user2: letting everyone win the lottery
user1: yea that was cool
user2: I am not sure about that part either, I think he did not tell her
user2: I did not like the end of the movie though
user2: it was too dramatic for a comedy movie
user1: lol i mean he was playing god so it had o be a lil dramtic
user1: dramatic

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi, how are you?
user2: Good. Have you heard of actor jim carrey
user1: Yes, he's quite good.
user2: One of his best movies is Bruce almighty, have you heard of him
user1: I've heard of it. Whats it about?
user2: Jim Carrey things nothing goes right for him and complains to god. Morgan freeman plays god and lets him play god for a week
user2: I.T is a Science fiction comedy hybrid
user1: That sounds funny, I like Morgan Freeman
user2: Morgan is the man. 48% on rotten tomatoes but it’s much better than that
user1: Im suprised its so low
user1: I mean not rated well
user2: Yea film critics are too stiff. You should watch this movie
user1: It sounds like it would be my kind of thing
user2: Additionally, Steve Carroll and Jennifer Aniston are in I.T too
user1: Oh, I love Steve Carroll!
user1: I can take or leave Jen Aniston
user2: also, Steve carrell is the main character in the sequel, Evan almighty
user1: I didn't know that
user1: So, I should see Bruce Almighty first?
user2: So do you think you will watch this movie
user2: Yes you definitely should
user1: I think I will!
user1: And the sequel as well
user2: Good clean fun for the entire family
user1: I like things I can share with my parents
user2: Any other questions about the movie?
user1: Do you know when it came ou?
user1: *out
user2: 2005
user2: Do you like old movies
user1: I do, classic hollywood is a favorite
user2: Wait I.T was actually 2005! I’m sorry
user1: no problem
user2: I️ meant 2003

conversation:
user1: I hope that Morgan Freeman is actually G-d in reality, if there is one.
user2: Yeah same here, looks like Rotten Tom atoes and Metacritic didn't score the movie very well...
user1: I've never heard of CinemaScore but they seem to think highly of it
user2: I'm more familiar with Rotten Tomatoes. But they do say Jim Carrey is hilarious in this movie 
user1: I've never heard of Lisa Ann Walter, but I assume she plays Jennifer Aniston's sister or mother in this. It doesn't say if they find out if he is G-d or not
user2: Same here, never heard of the side characters. I have no idea who Philip Baker Hall is. He isn't sharing any simiar character last name so I'm guessing he might play a friend
user1: Do you know what it means to "get bogged down in treacle"? I don't know what to make of that review
user2: I have no idea what that word means, but I'm assuming they are trying to say the movie lacked in substance or Carrey's acting ability? It seems the second review doesn't think Jim is a real actor "...Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" Both reviews don't seem to like his acting skills....
user1: I'd still see it given the cast. Never heard of the director though
user1: Hello?

conversation:
user2: Hey, there's this movie called Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey in it, have you seen it or would you like to?
user1: I haven't seen it.
user1: Have you seen it?
user1: What's it about?
user2: I have seen it, it's really funny. It's a comedy made in 2003 about a down on his luck tv reporter who complains to god and in return becomes god for a week
user1:  I like comedies. Is Jim Carrey pretty good in it?
user2: it is known as one of his best films, so I would say yes, it is very slapstick comedy
user1: Is it also a romance?
user2: no, it's a comedy
user2: no it is not
user1: Too bad. I like romantic comedies.
user1: Does being God work out for him?

conversation:
user2: Hi
user2: what is the name of the movie?
user1: Bruce Almighty 
user2: what is the movie about
user1: The movie is about a tv reporter who complains about Gods presence in his life guidance and so is offered the chance to do his job for one week
user2: That sounds interesting.
user1: It is a well written comedy, have you seen it?
user1:  It features an all star cast of Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Lisa Ann Walker and Phillip Baker Hall. 
user2: Not the whole thing just bits and pieces.
user2: I like comedies with Jim Carrey in them
user2: I have seen Even Almighty it similar to that one?
user1: me too! 
user1: I am not sure I at liberty to disclose that lol?
user1: re: the rules
user2: Ok
user1: but I will tell you a little more about the movie
user2: ok that would be great
user2: I keep meaning to watch it but seem to always forget
user1: So Carreys character, Bruce Nolan, is a reporter. Hardworking, but not very successful. He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him
user1: He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers
user2: So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with.
user1: More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered"
user2: oh ok
user1: Bruce starts responding with yeses to all the prayers he receives, and as you can imagine that's were a lot of the conflict AND comedy come in to play
user2: I enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line.
user1: oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with Jennifer Annistons character as well
user2: Would you recommend this movie?
user1: oh yea 
user2: From what you have said about Bruce Almighty it seems like a very good movie.
user1: I actually forgot about it, and how well written it is now that I really think about it
user1: its a bit of a tear jerker too lol
user2: I am looking forward to adding it to my list of movies to watch.
user2: I like feel good movies but do cry easy during movies that are tear jerkers.
user1: I would add this one, its worth watching
user2: I hope my movie store has it.
user1: also seems to be a bit of a classic especially with it being Jim Carrey
user2: or I will have to find someone that does.
user2: I have netflix I will check there
user2: Thank you for telling me about this movie I appreciate it.
user1: you still have a movie store lol which one??
user2: Family Video
user2: Its the only one in town
user1: I don't believe Netflix has it, but worth checking
user1: also red box..
user1: oh yes, we have one too I forgot about that
user2: oh yeah i forgot about red box
user1: they should have it, again it is a classic
user1: either of them might and youre welcome!
user1: I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

conversation:
user1: Hello - what is the movie we are discussing?
user2: Hello, Bruce Almighty
user1: Ah interesting - i just watched a clip of that on youtube last night
user2: Yeah it is a really funny movie with Jim Carrey
user2: what did you think of the clip?
user1: Do you think Jim Carrey was well cast for the role?
user2: Yes, he was perfect.
user1: It was funny, "oh mighty smiter"
user1: Can you give me a brief summary of what it's about?
user2: yeah great scene!
user2: It is about Bruce who works as a news reporter but is wanting to become something bigger in his employment. He then becomes very powerful to teach a life lesson as the role of God
user1: I like the idea of it, but it almost seems like it could be a sort of dark movie
user1: instead of a light hearted comedy
user2: it isn't at all. 
user1: Do you think it could have been made that way?
user2: no I don't think the movie could have been made dark. the comedy in it was a perfect fit for the script.
user1: Like, imagine if Groundhog Day (if you've seen it) was made but wasn't a laughy comedy
user1: well, imagine what someone could/would do if they've been given Godly powers, I think it's an interesting idea
user2: I am sure some people would try and use it for evil. But in a sense it teaches you to be grateful for everything if used properly
user1: who else is in the movie?
user2: Jennifer Aniston she plays his grilfriend
user2: and Morgan Freeman plays God
user1: Cool. Did the critics like the movie?
user2: They recieved a 5.7/10 Rotten Tomatoes
user1: oh wow, that's pretty low
user2: And a cinemascore rating of an A
user2: I think it a movie that appeals to people with Jim Careys comedy
user2: I personally crack up at his films. He has a dry humor that I love
user2: Other Critics have said that this is his best film
user1: Yeah me too, I loved Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber...but I also thought he was excellent in slightly serious comedies like Truman Show
user2: Yeah he excels in his films and truly becomes the character. 
user1: I think I would just like a movie like this to take itself just a little more seriously
user1: Ok good conversation!

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user2: I haven't seen Bruce Almighty for some reason, but I do love Jim Carrey.
user1: I haven't seen this one either, but I have heard that it is pretty funny.
user2: It's a pretty great idea. I'm sure it's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but he is really funny and so is Morgan Freeman.
user2: Jennifer Aniston annoys me a little though, I gotta say
user1: I really do like Morgan Freeman, most of his movies are good. I think I might have to check this one out.
user2: I look at Rotten Tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though, and 48% is pretty low. It has been out for a while, though.
user1:  I don't know why, but she has annoyed me through the years too. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, I just don't really like her very much.
user1:  Yes, it has been out for quite some time. Maybe it's on Netflix.
user2: Do you like comedies like this, or are you more into dramas?
user1:  My favorite movie genre is science fiction, but I do like a good comedy, or a good drama. If it's a good movie, I really don't care what genre it is.
user2: That's true. The first review under the "critical response" section is pretty harsh. I'm not sure I really ever read or care about movie reviews, just the ratings % online
user1:  When looking at movie reviews, I put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then I do official critics.
user2: True. Looking at the Key Scenes, I feel like the plot might have been a little paint-by-numbers and relying on Jim Carrey's personality too much, which is probably why it wasn't better recieved.
user1:  Yes, I can I didn't get that impression.
user1:  Sorry, this is supposed to say that I did get that impression.
user2: I guess that's part of his appeal, he can take any kind of material and make it funny. Also Steve Carrell is a great, funny actor too and I can see him being a good villian.
user1:  Yes, he is pretty good in everything he does.
user2: I haven't even heard of Metacritic or CinemaScore, to be honest. But it's weird that it's 46/100 on Metacritic and and A on CinemaScore. Those are pretty different scores.
user1:  That's true, I'm not sure how they score these things.
user2: The part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply "yes" is pretty funny and says a lot about religion.
user1:  Sounds pretty funny, I will have to put it on my list.
user2: I do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with Jimmy Hoffa's body sound cheesy. I'm not sure!
user1:  I agree with that statement.
user2: I do think if I had the power of being God I'd use it for better things!
user1:  For sure!
user2: Interesting. I mean, the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard.
user1:  I agree, however, it might be worth a watch.
user2: The best part of the movie is probably the middle section where he's testing out all of his powers. Seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description.
user1:  I'm not the hugest Jim Carrey fan, but I'll give it a try.
user2: Yeah I think he is so out-there that this is a perfect film for him.
user1:  Yeah, he always seems to play some crazy out-of-control guy.

conversation:
user2: Do you like comedies?
user1: yes i enjoy them very much
user2: Bruce Almighty is a great comedy. It's got Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman. It's one of Carrey's best films
user1: I like both of them Jim has a lot of range
user2: Definitely. It's great. Morgan plays God and gives his divine powers to Jim for a week.
user1: If anyone could play God it would be Morgan
user2: Yeah. It only has a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes which is weird. But it got an A on cinemaScore.
user1: Is it very funny?
user2: Yeah it's hilarious. High-concept comedy.
user1: sounds like one to watch
user2: Absolutely. Carrey plays this TV field reporter, Bruce Nolan. His rival at the news station is played by Steve Carell.
user1: I love Steve Carell.
user1: Sounds like this movie has a few stars in it
user2: Yeah, so he gets a promotion over Nolan and steals his line on air, which basically pushes to the brink.
user2: Definitely a lot of stars
user1: wow what a concept
user2: It has Jennifer Aniston as Nolan's girlfriend, Grace
user1: another well known star.
user2: When he gets God's powers, he does hilarious stuff, like find Hoffa's body
user2: And  he gets Carrel's character fired
user2: and gets his job back
user1: Lol thats funny
user1: how was the chemistry between Carrey and Aniston
user2: Things were going well. She thought he was going to propose, but at that dinner he started hearing a bunch of voices that he realized were PRAYERS
user1: Thats interesting 
user2: So since he's God, he just says to every prayer
user1: thats right he has gods power 
user2: idk, it came out in 2003. it's a fun movie
user1: I am going to have to look for that film
user2: Yeah it's one of my favorite comedies

conversation:
user1: Jim Carrey is a great actor that has had a lot of major roles in movies. What is your favorite movie with Jim Carrey?
user2: I enjoyed Liar Liar the most. He has a lot of good movies though. What did you like about Bruce Almighty?
user1: I enjoyed that Bruce Almighty was a comedy because I enjoy a good laugh. I also liked how the movie introduced God, which not many movies do. What did you like most about Bruce Almighty?
user1: Do you think that the movie deserves the rating that it received?
user2: Yes I liked the role of Morgan Freeman as "God" also. I also like the setting of the movie which is memorable to me because Im from Buffalo. 
user2: I think it was rated pretty low. What score would you have given it?
user1: Oh that is interesting! Morgan Freeman is another great actor. His voice can be used in many settings and roles. 
user1: I think that it should have been rated higher. It seems like rotten tomatoes always gives low ratings though.
user1: Wasn't there a sequel to this movie?
user2: Do you feel like this movie was a breakout movie for Jim Carrey?
user2: Im not 100% sure. But it did have like an open end to the movie
user1: I think that he has a lot of recognition for being in this movie. But I am not sure of other movies he was in before this one. 
user2: I think Ace Ventura and the Mask may have come out before this. Not sure 
user1: I also enjoyed him in the Grinch movie. He is able to perform many different roles across many genres of movies. 
user2: Has he played any serious movie roles like a drama? 
user1: I am not sure about that. He seems to be more of a comedian type actor. 
user2: Do you know any other movies by this director?
user1: If you were in a similar situation as Bruce (like in the key scene mentioned), would you feel frustrated as well?
user1: I have not heard of any other movies by this director. 
user2: Yes I think his frustrations are very relatable in many aspects of life
user1: I agree. I would feel the same way if I were constantly experiencing bad luck
user2: Would you want to play "God" for a week? What would you do?
user1: I probably wouldn't, only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world. But I would like to eliminate suffering in people. What about you?
user2: Same here. I would probably end up like Bruce and end up saying yes to everyones prayers since it would be so overwhelming
user2: Do you think that was the best way for him to answer prayers through email?
user1: I agree. I think the email system was less personal than how God would actually answer prayers in reality. However, at that point I'm sure he was overwhelmed. How would you answer everyone's prayers if you had to be God?
user2: Maybe through some type of app which is more modern now.  Do you think Bruce and Grace made a good couple?
user1: I think that the fact that they came back together and reconciled proves that they were always meant to be together. 
user2: What do you think he learned the most about being God for the week?
user1: I think he learned about true happiness and how much people need prayers and responses by God. I think that he now understands that importance of not complaining. 

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello! Have you seen Bruce Almighty starring Jim Carrey?
user2: Yes I've seen it. 
user2: but it's been a long time. 
user1: I think that it is one of Jim Carrey's best movies. Morgan Freeman plays God.
user2: Yeah I liked it too. Very funny movie. Morgan Freeman is great. They couldn't have picked a better person. 
user1: He is wonderfully relaxed and kind.  Jennifer Aniston is  it also as his girlfriend.
user2: Oh I don't remember that. Awesome though I love her. 
user2: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user1: She is just so patient. I thought they were funny together
user1: I loved the part where he wanted sex and he pulled the moon closer then the next morning found out there were all kinds of weather repercussions.  Also where he got the dog to flush the toilet.  how about you?
user2: The monkey part. hahah
user1: do you remember Steve Carell as the anchorman that steals the promotion from Bruce?
user2: No I don't. It's been a while since I've seen it. I may have to watch again. Forgot there were so many stars in it. 
user1: He steals dialogue from Bruce. He then accepts the promotion that Bruce wanted on air.
user2: ohhh okay
user1: Catherine Bell was also the other anchor that Bruce had a mild crush on.
user2: I'm not sure who that is. lol. 
user1: Bruce starts earning his anchor job as he makes incredible events happen while he is covering silly everyday cookoffs, etc. He made a meteor land, He found the body of Jimmy Hoffa, etc. 
user1: Bruce also keeps running into Morgan Freeman to ask about doing his job?
user1: Do you remember the prayers ringing in Bruce's head?
user2: yeah

conversation:
user1: Hello? is someone there?
user1: Have you ever seen Bruce Almighty? It's a Jim Carret movie I actually like
user1: Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston are also in it, 
user2: Hello im here. Im reading the paragraph quickly
user1: Oh I thought you didn't have it sorry!
user2: No problem! Yeah, I guess we both got it
user1: Have you ever seen Bruce Almighty? lol
user2: Haha I have! I actually like it a lot too
user1: I actually do as well, it's weird haha I definitely think there are worse Jim Carrey movies
user2: I can't believe it is from 2003! It doesn't seem that old
user1: Shooooooot
user2: I agree. Like Cable Guy lol
user1: I had forgotten that Jennifer Aniston was in it too lol
user1: wow I feel old bahaha
user2: I know, what an odd pair!
user1: I mean, with this movie, I get the rotten tomatoes score but the concept was good I think
user1: omg it only got scored a 46 out of 100
user1: yikes
user2: I think it was too. Yeah, raunchy comedy, but the premise was good
user2: And Morgan Freeman helps make it legit haha
user1: that's very true, he's a national treasure
user1: what is happening with the document on the side?
user1: oh wait I get it lol
user1: I had forgotten about the email prayer scene thing lol
user2: It took a while for mine to come through after the first page. Finally got it
user1: classic stuff
user2: Hahaha yes!  
user1: It's also my worst fear.....reply all to the whole world?! no thanks
user2: And the Jimmy Hoffa bit was good too
user2: Omg can you even imagine ?? In this day and age? Total anarchy
user1: The way they broke up these paragraphs makes it seem like he reconciled with grace way earlier than he did
user1: at least if I remember correctly
user1: it's like your typical "I learned the error of my ways, I really have changed" and then the movie ends with everything being okay
user2: Yeah I agree
user2: I just laughed out loud remembering him messing with Steve Carrell's character even on air poll
user1: omg
user2: *lol
user1: classic stuff
user1: didn't he plant weed in the van too?
user1: so good
user2: Haha! I don't remember that part. Hilarious
user2: I need to watch it again soon
user1: I think I remember Carrey like getting back at Evan in some way by planting a crap ton of weed in his news van
user2: That is so funny. I almost felt bad for Evan when he was just speaking gibberish on live air hahaha
user2: But not too bad
user1: I was going to say, not bad enough bahaha
user2: Imagine having that power and responsibility he is given. No way. I will just take care of myself thankless
user2: *thanksss 
user1: Yeah omg that type of power could go to someone's head way too quickly
user2: The stress ugh
user2: Well I think I found the next movie I'm going to watch!
user1: right binging this weekend thank you very much
user2: Hahaha sounds good to me
user2: Was fun chatting with you about this one
user1: right? I feel like I had a good partner lol the first one quit on me
user1: good luck friend! Happy turking
user2: Same here! I was hesitant to come back
user2: Thanks you too!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello!
user2: I hope you are doing well tonight. 
user2: I just got through watching a funny movie with Jim Carrey in it .
user1: Same to you! I haven't seen Bruce Almighty in forever.
user2: I haven't either until tonight. It was hilarious. 
user1: It has really funny parts, but I agree with the first couple of ratings. It's not his best.
user1: It has a great cast, though.
user2: Yes.I like Morgan Freeman
user2: Did you watch Jim in his new movie about Andy Caufman? It was very starnge
user1: Me too. No I haven't, what's it called?
user1: I can't believe it's been 15 years since this one has came out. Crazy.
user2: Jim and Andy the great beyond. Its more like a documentary
user2: wow 15 years yes it has been awhile. that makes me feel old
user1: Yeah me too, haha. That last review is funny, "Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" Lolll
user2: lol
user2: I cant believe it says its one of his best films 
user2: Some of it was over the top
user2: I like Jennifer Aniston.s role as Grace . She is a good actress in everything she does.
user1: Yeah it was over the top. Me too, she helps balance him out a bit.
user2: Yes finding Jimmy Hoffa in the movie was a bit far fetched lol
user1: I love the scene it's talking about in No. 2 when he's trying to go through all the emails and gets overwhelmed.
user2: Lol Yes and he just agrees with every one of them
user2: The voices in his head drove him crazy and then he checked out Graces Prayer That was a good moment in the movie
user2: And Evan was such a Jerk and he got the promotion instead 
user2: Are you still here lol
user1: Yeah sorry lol. 
user2: its ok I didnt know if you got disconnected
user1: I'm trying to think of anything else to say about this movie or the scenes but honestly it's not an easy one to talk about.
user1: I don't actually remember much about the end of the movie, I could stand to rewatch it if I had more time
user2: yeah I know what you mean. Its pretty cut and dry . He didnt get a promotion he became god for a week and then leanred a lesson and  lived happliy ever after when he was done
user2: he had a girlfriend grace but he was crushing on another woman too
user1: Which is lame because Jennifer Aniston is super hot haha
user1: I wish I could remember what the homeless man's sign says at the end
user2: I think so too. 
user2: he had alot of those signs during the movie lol
user2: r ewe blind lol
user2: thy kingdumb come
user1: Those are pretty good lol

conversation:
user1: hi, have you seen the movie, Bruce Almighty?
user2: I have
user2: It's pretty good
user2: Have you?
user2: I can't believe that it came out in 2003!
user1: Yes, I have. I LOVED it. I know, seems like it hasn't been out that long. 
user1: Jim Carrey is one of my favorites. 
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: I really liked the part when Morgan Freeman appeared.
user2: Sorry for the delay, my computer froze.
user2: I haven't seen Jim Carrey in any movies other than this one.

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hello how are you today?
user2: Doing great how about yourself?
user1: The movie today is Bruce Almighty, starring Jim Carrey.
user2: Great how was the movie?
user1: Im doing ok, a bit under the weather but alive...lol
user2: God bless! Did you like the movie?
user1: Well according to rotten tomatoes it only scored 48%, have you seen this show?
user2: What was it about?
user1: I have seen it, I enjoyed it, It is a comedy directed by Tom Shadyac.
user2: Who played in this film?
user1: Jim Carrey plays a man named Bruce Nolan, and Morgan Freeman plays God
user2: What happened in this film?
user1: Jennifer Annistanis also in it and plays bruces girlfriend interest
user2: What is the plot of this movie?
user1: So bruce is a news reporter with hopes of becoming an anchor, but is not seen as mature by co workers
user2: Jim plays as Bruce who is a news reporter
user2: ?
user2: He plans to become a news anchor?
user1: He suffers from chronic bad luck, and he breaks when he is passed up for a job by his rival evan baxter
user2: Haha
user2: So what happens next?
user2: ?
user1: So he somehow finds God and is given powers of from god because he does nothing but complain to him how he isnt doing his job right..God isnt, so bruce now has god powers
user2: Wow! So Bruce finds God?
user2: And he was given power?
user1: So Bruce finds all these different ways to make miraculous events occur so that he can cover the news story
user2: What happens to his girlfriend? What did she say?
user1: he starts to hear voices and finds out it is peoples prayers, so he starts answering those prayers and all lets loose
user2: He fears people's prayers?
user2: *hears
user1: his girlfriend Grace is disappointed in Bruce, see bruce finally gets the anchor job by deceit and takes her to a fancy restaurant
user1: she thinks he is going to propose but instead  he talks all about just himself
user2: Was she disappointed?
user1: she was, and then she leaves him
user2: Interesting her name is called Grace
user2: What happens next?
user1: so he sees god again because nothing is working out for him still, and god tells him to pray for what he truly wants
user2: Awesome. It was great talking to you!
user1: so he prays that Grace to find a man that would make her happy

conversation:
user2: Hello!  How are you?
user1: Just watched Bruce Almighty! Pretty okay movie
user1: How are you?
user2: Great!  I saw it and don't understand why it didn't score higher on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: I understood unfortunately :/
user1: I liked what they were trying to do, and I liked the celebrity cast, but it was too low brow for a 'high concept' comedy
user2: At least CinemaScore gave it an A.  I thought the concept of Carrey getting to play God for a week was very original.
user1: It didn't want you to think. 
user1: Yeah. Carrey kinda saved the film for me. He's a pretty insane character actor
user2: That he is!  I love his stuff.
user2: Morgan Freeman was pretty cool as God, I don't know whether God thought that was funny.
user1: Yeah, same. I can't believe they said it was an 'okay' performance though.
user1: Lol. 
user1: I'm sure God would be honored.
user1: I thought the early parts were pretty decently handled
user2: Lol.  I was hoping Carrey would dump Anniston and be bolder with Catherine Bell.
user1: Like, I liked that they started with a really low key opening
user1: Me too.
user2: Steve Carrell was a real jerk though, wasn't he?
user1: A really well acted jerk
user2: Can you believe he ripped off Carrey's material though that was pretty low-down.
user1: It was pretty messed up
user2: I thought finding Juimmy Hoffa's body was a really nice touch.
user1: The God parts were more boring imo.
user1: Like there were thought provoking places to take it.
user2: At least he got the anchor job finally.
user1: It was cool that he got his job.
user1: His god stuff was petty but cool.
user2: Yeah.  It was sort of lame setting prayers on an email system and setting it to autoreply yes though.
user1: It was an obviously not good idea i think
user2: I can't believe Carrey married Anniston!
user1: It was cute! I loved it, I don't know..
user2: It sure had some original thought, gotta give it that.
user1: Him giving up the god stuff at the end was pretty expected
user1: Yeah, original idea at least.
user2: Right.  I suppose I see why there wasn't a Bruce Almighty II
user1: Good convo. I'll see you.
user2: Okay take care

conversation:
user2: hei
user1: Hello
user2: can you give me some information about the movie?
user1: Do you like movies about  the supernatural?
user2: I think so
user2: I have not seen so many
user2: so far
user1: Well this movie is about a news reporter who complains about his life in general and wish to control the world or become God himself
user2: This sounds very nice! 
user1: It is a great comedy film starring Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston
user1: Yes it does.
user2: I think I may have seen it
user2: but I am not sure
user1: Yeah Morgan plays God who offers Bruce a chance to become like him.
user2: and he is God for a limited time?
user1: You can say he does
user2: nice so he is God for a day. 
user2: yep, I saw the movie
user2: It s awesome
user1: I guess until he learns a lesson
user2: I think so too..
user1: also Steve Carrell is Evan, a co anchor Bruce does not like and hilariously make him fumble his words on air embarrassing him on TV for everyone to see.
user2: Really? that sounds fun to see
user1: Yeah the movie is definitely a must see as the main character learns what he wish for comes with a price.
user1: Like going crazy after hearing voices of people of prayer  in his head
user2: that seems like a tough time for him
user1: Yeah it were. well that's the price he paid for playing "God". Along the way he disappointed his girlfriend as she believed he was going to propose during a dinner date but made the announcement he got  a promotion instead.
user2: But in the end I think everyone is happy
user2: and learns a good lesson
user1: Bruce thought it might be a beginning of the end of their relationship with Grace and asked God himself to find someone who will make her truly happy
user2: oh, I see
user1: You are right. However Bruce ends up in the hospital and Grace came to him and they rekindled their relationship. He goes back to reporting after getting the promotion he wanted
user1: Nice talking to you!
user2: Yep, me too budy
user2: take care

conversation:
user2: Hi new friend! Have you seen Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston?
user1: I have seen it! it was actually on tv the other day and and i watched it.
user2:  Bruce Almighty is such a funny movie. Jim Carrey is funny as usual and he and Jennifer Anniston seemed to have good on screen chemistry. I wouldn't expect them to be so compatible, but they were so funny together.
user1: i thought it was pretty funny too. I'm not usually a fan of jim carrey, his sense of humor doesn't do it for me. But this one wasn't too bad.
user2: It was funny that Jim's character Bruce had the chance at being 'God' for a week.
user1: yea. i liked the concept of the movie. definitely shows that being god isn't an easy job!
user2: Morgan freeman is always a great actor too. He can play just about any role, I think he did a fantastic job.
user1: yea, he is a great actor. his sense of humor is really relatable
user2: I've seen him in other serious movies, but nothing comedic. Well done.
user1: it was nice to see him show a different side of his acting abilities
user2: I liked how his dream of becoming an anchorman opened up the option for another movie. His choices as God seemed so hilarious. His bad luck before hand was pretty funny too.
user1: yea. his luck really changes once he was god and could control everything, but it made it so his life wasnt really genuine. it was all orchestrated by him
user2: How about that part when his rival, Steve Carell's part Evan Baxter, got the promotion over him?
user2: I think Steve Carell is so funny, but sometimes his humor makes me so uncomfortable. I know that's the appeal, and it's super affective, but geez. 
user1: that definitely made him mad. cant blame him i guess. i actually like steve carell better than jim carrey
user2: Me too
user1: then he starred in the sequel i think
user2: Yeah, did you see that one too?
user1: i did once a while ago. dont really remember all the details of that one
user2: I thought some of the powers they gave Bruce were pretty funny like the meteor shower, making Evan look like a fool on air, and the shenanigans of granting everyone's prayer.
user1: yea. i like when he opens the file cabinet and its sooooo long. and his email blowing up with pryyers is overwhelming.
user2: I'm surprised Rotten Tomatoes only gave it 48% and it got a 5.7/10.
user2: Although in the Cinena the movie scored an A
user1: really? id think it would be a little higher than that. guess a lot of people thought it was dumb
user2: I never trust what the critic's say, I guess I like dumb movies in their view. Ha ha!
user2: I think we've done 12?
user1: yea i dont go by critics reviews either
user1: im not sure how many weve done. i cant click my finish button yet though
user2: I've seen this movie several times, and I liked it each time, but I don't remember the ending right now. I'm going to have to watch it again
user1: they show it on tv pretty often. id say like every couple months its on either tbs or ET
user2: I don't have those channels, maybe I can find it to rent on Amazon Prime, or Netflix.
user2: It was nice talking to you! Have a great day.
user1: yea it might be on netflix. ive never checked
user1: bye!

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi
user2: Bruce Almighty didn't get such great ratings from rotten tomatoes
user1: It has a good cast.
user2: I agree, love that Jennifer Anniston
user2: Aniston*
user2: I like that God was black
user1: Morgan Freeman plays a good god.
user2: yep
user1: He's got the voice for it.
user2: Totally
user2: What did you think about Jim Carrey
user1: It's not his best work.
user1: I forgot that Steve Carrell was in Buce Almighty.
user1: Bruce Almighty
user2: oh yeah
user2: I agree, he was often over the top
user1: Carrell or Carrey?
user1: Do you think Steve Carrell was a good villain?
user2: Its funny because after seeing some of his other work
user2: its really hard to imagine him as a good villain
user2: I think both of them are generally over the top
user2: though
user1: It would be hard to resist using those powers selfishly.
user1: But I guess the moral of the movie is that with power comes obligation.
user1: Another of the movie's messages is that not every prayer can be answered.
user1: Also, getting what you pray for won't make you happy for some reason.
user2: I remember that
user2: Be careful what you wish for
user2: *and lassoing the moon is a much bigger deal than you think
user1: You don't want to throw tidal forces off.
user1: It had a pretty sappy ending.
user1: I didn't like it.
user1: Some of the comedy was good, but it didn't match with the philosophical message.
user1: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user1: Are you there?

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hi
user2: haha this is a good movie
user2: have you seen it?
user1: yes I love it actually
user2: the plot its not very attractive
user2: but the actors are very very good
user2: jim carrey and freeman
user1: I am surprised to read the critical response
user1: yes they are
user2: haha well yea comedies more or less dont get much good response
user1: that's true
user2: they're usuallty rated around 60-70%
user1: dang those ratings are harsh
user2: yea but i never care about ratings much
user1: I would have rated it a little higher than that i think
user2: these days ratings are bad like
user2: really bad
user2: 100% for black panther
user1: really? wow
user2: best movie of all times lmao
user2: its all marketing
user2: publicity
user1: I love steve carell in this movie and what Carrey does to him when he's on the news
user1: yep, youre right
user2: ahahha thats hilarious
user1: haha the old email system he uses, remember that?  "youve got mail"
user2: yea
user2: every prayer
user2: from all over the world
user2: coming to his inbox :D
user1: finding jimmy hoffa!! hahaha
user2: i like the ending too
user2: its not a bad movie at all to be honest
user1: Im kind of cheesy like that, but I like the way the movie ends, and that he starts being grateful for what he has
user1: yep, me to
user2: yea, it delivers a strong message to the audience
user1: I think it's good to have some movies with a good message sometimes

conversation:
user1: Heyo
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: I cannot see the movie, so can you tell me what it is?
user1: Bruce Almighty
user1: Have you seen it?
user1: Its hilarious 
user2: Yes, a long time ago. How about you?
user1: Samer
user2: I love Jim Carrey
user1: Same, ace ventura was childhood
user1: Theres a scene in bruse almight with steve correll
user1: hello?
user2: Now you're talking my language. 
user1: haha
user1: the office fan?
user1: The cast for bruce almighty was stellar
user1: Morgan freemon as God was a force that coudnt be stopped
user1: Hello?
user1: Do you enjoy slap stick comedies?
user1: Hola?
user1: I need a reply to move on

conversation:
user2: Hi there, do you like comedy movies?
user1: HI! Yeah I love comedies
user2: Good, have you ever seen bruce almighty?
user1: Yes, I have a few years ago
user2: It stars Jim Carrey.
user2: It is a high concept comedy. Did youliek it?
user1: Yes Jim Carrey is an awesome actor and he really knows how to play the part
user2: I think he did a good job portraying bruce when he was a down on his luck reporter.
user1: Yes that does sound like a good representation of his character.
user2: I also thought it was so funny to have him complain to god and get to be him for a week. 
user1: Yeah that does sound funny, that scene is iconic
user2: Morgan freeman plays god if you recall.
user2: I liked jeniffer aniston as grace his girlfriend as well.
user1: Yes the cast was great and they all worked well together.
user2: Though the critics seemed pretty harsh...
user2: ONLY 48% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: I did not realize it had bad reviews everyone I know has always liked the film
user2: Also one critic said,'...seen as too comedic by his felow workers. Kind of like carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor."
user2: I was surprised it was poorly rated as well.
user1: Oh wow thats a little harsh
user2: I think it is a cute film
user2: totally harsh
user2: I think it is silly but fun. 
user1: Yes it is especially if you want a good laugh
user2: SEEING HIM OVERWHEMED BYALL THE PRAYERS AND HIM TRYIGN TO MANAGE IS HILARIOUS
user1: Yeah that is a funny scene
user2: Steve carell was funny as Evan baxter.
user2: His rival..
user1: Yes it was a film of up and coming actors who are all now very famous
user2: The scenewith him stealing dialogue from an unaird segment by bruce is really good
user2: Ya, it is funny to rewatch and see people who have now become stars in their own right.
user2: Jeniffer aninston and morgan freeman were already stars..
user1: Yeah I need to go rewatch the movie and see how fun it was
user2: But steve carell was not fully on my radar in 2003.
user2: Yes you shoudl rewatch it, it seems to be on tv all the time.
user1: Yeah many of them grew after the film 
user2: I can't believe it has been 15 years since it came out.
user1: Yeah I will need to find it
user1: Yeah it really has been a long time

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: What are your thoughts about this movie?
user2: I am a big fan of this movie
user1: Do you think it should have gotten a better rating than it did?
user2: I think so. It deserved a much higher rating.
user1: What was your favorite actor in this movie?
user2: I think 48 percent is way too low
user2: I love Jim Carrey
user1: I agree
user2: What about you?
user1: I love anything he is in
user2: I agree. At least one score gave it a good rating.
user1: I've seen this movie before and it was wonderful l thought
user2: The story of the film is very interesting. 
user1:  Do you generally watch movies with (good/bad) ratings?
user2: Yes, I don
user2: pay much attention to ratings
user1: The performance that Jim Carey have in this movie was great don't you think?
user2: I agree
user1: Was you aware Morgan Freeman played God?
user2: Yes, I liked him in it
user1: He is also a great actor don't you think?
user2: He is amazing
user1: Jennifer Anniston is also a fine actress and very beautiful
user2: She was very good in the movie. She added a lot
user1: They say this was one of Jim Carey's best films, did you see that?
user2: I didn't. I think it is not true though. There are better films he was in
user1: I think LIER LIER was better myself. What do you think?
user2: I think so. 
user1: Dumb and dumber was to funny!

conversation:
user1: Hey. Just watched Bruce Almighty, eh?
user2: Yes I thought it was average at best. 
user1: Seems like a fair assessment, me too.
user1: Jim Carrey is kind of silly-stupid funny
user2: Tom Shadyac directed the movie and I honestly expected more. Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan didn't really do it for me and Jennifer Aniston character was okay. 
user1: But what about Morgan Freeman as God?
user2: Who doesn't love Morgan Freeman lol 
user2: I think Morgan being God was to add to the humor but I don't know for me it still fell flat.
user1: I mean, he basically is god so... fit into the role well
user1: It was probably the only funny part to me
user2: Lol agree haha! Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 48% and Metacritic scored it a 46/100 ouch!
user2: What did you think about the story line? 
user1: I think the common folk thought it was more entertaining than the critics
user1: I mean... it's a pretty silly set up to start with it
user2: Bruce suffered from so much bad luck throughout the movie it's hard to take it seriously. I mean who honestly has that much bad luck lol
user1: Do you think he had good intentions playing God?
user2: I think so and in all honestly they depicted God in a good way. It gives you a idea of what God is like answering prayers day in and day out and Bruce could not handle that much responsibility as it was driving him nuts. 
user1: I mean, he is only human.. ha.
user1: I think it was a pretty inoffensive, humorous take on God/people's relationships
user2: Yes of course and sorry but back to the story-line Bruce answers everyone prayers and can you imagine the chaos that could have caused in real life? I feel like the whole movie was rushed and not much thought went into making it. 
user1: Maybe the humor was lacking because they were playing it too safe, ha
user2: Yes I totally agree. I feel like if your going to put Jim Carrey in a movie you don't have to play it safe. Jim is known for his slapstick humor and over the top antics. 
user1: True. They had to just solve everything at once
user2: Just to be fair it is a okay movie to watch if you have nothing else to do lol
user2: I honestly enjoyed the ending more than the beginning with the homeless man holding the sign up and showing the positive message. 
user1: That seems fair.. have to end it on a positive note, ha
user2: Lol yes and I liked the part when God told Bruce to pray and his request was for Grace to find a man that makes her happy and it ended up being him. Those are my favorite parts of the entire movie. 
user1: Aww, yeah, that's sweet. :)
user2: What would you rate the movie 1-10? 
user1: Probably like. a 4 or 5. ha. Harsh, but it's not really that deep or terribly funny
user1: What about you
user2: I agree not harsh at all lol 3 and that's being too nice haha!

conversation:
user1: hey, hows it goin?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hey
user1: have you seen the movie?
user2: No I haven't.
user1: i think its hilarious
user1: but im a huge fan of jim carrey
user1: do you know about the movie a little?
user2: I can take him or leave him.
user2: It says it's about a guy given the chance to be God for awhile.
user1: thats right! could you imagine having that power
user1: like kanye said "no one man should have all that power"
user2: It could make for a fun movie idea.
user2: The new info mentions Steve Carell.  I'm a pretty big fan of his.
user1: Love him too!
user2: The critics seem mixed on the movie.  But I don't listen to them so much about comedies.
user1: Me either especally when the fans like it
user2: Good stories are fine, but comedies don't need them to make you laugh
user2: I think it's been awhile since Jim Carrey was in a movie.  Haven't noticed him, at least.
user1: same here
user2: are you still there?

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: HI!
user2: Do you like comedies?
user1: Yes, i do.
user1: what about you?
user2: Do you like Jim Carrey's comedies?
user1: Yes, i like him, especially in The Mask
user2: Well, Bruce Almighty is not exactly like The Mask, but it is still hilarious.
user1: It was pretty funny.
user2: Jennifer Aniston was great as well.
user1: I love all her movies.
user2: The critics did not like it though.  Not too sure why.
user1: I dont care about the critics. 
user2: Morgan Freeman was brilliant, as usual
user1: He always is...
user2: Yeah, some of those movies that critics praise, I find them to be dull.
user1: So true. I like to make my one opinions
user1: own*
user2: I like the fact that it is a romance comedy.   
user2: Although it was hard to watch how the female character was treated
user1: What do you mean by that?
user2: I am not talking about any MeToo thing.  
user1: ha ha ha
user2: Just in the movie, how he ignored her.
user1: aaaaaa. got it
user1: He was the Almighty :)))
user2: Yeah, it was really about art reflecting life
user2: But there was a happy ending and also a moral one
user2: Getting what you want does not necessarily make you happy
user2: The most important thing in life is human relationships
user1: I agree with that.
user2: And you don't turn your back on people who genuinely care for you
user1: You need other poeple to succed in life.
user2: There is really a lot of depth in the movie.  It is a pity the critics couldn't see that.  After all, Jim Carey is sort of type cast and  Jennifer Aniston is not one of the more serious actresses in the business
user1: It's important to have someone next to you to support you.
user2: And it is also important to recognize such a person.  He took her for granted
user1: They play more in comedies than serious movies.
user2: Well, Jim Carey was in Majestic.  That was sort of serious.
user1: Some men do that. At least he appreciated her at the end
user1: True... but i can't picture him in a serious role to much
user2: it is possible
user1: i liked the strugle he had to build everithing.
user2: Yes, the struggle is real

conversation:
user1: hey, how goes?
user2: Hello, good. How are you?

user2: oh...
user1: what movie do you have?
user1: Im have a sheet for bruce almighty
user2: I have Bruce Almighty
user2: as well
user1: ok, it must be working now. IDK. Ive had to quit 4 different attempts so lets do this while its working

user2: Yes I did. Have you?
user1: Many times
user2: The movie was amazing 
user1: Im a bit of a jim carrey fan myself
user2: Oh I see. He is a good actor.
user1: yes, he is
user2: What was your favorite scene in the movie?
user1: I like when he messes with the reporters lol
user2: That was so funny
user1: the scene with steve carell reporting and he screws with their voices
user1: something is wrong
user2: ?

conversation:
user2: I have not seen this movie before but the familiar actors that are cast looks like the movie would be interesting based off of the actors choice in movies.
user1: Yes, I usually enjoy Jim Carey movies. This one seems funny.
user1: I'm sure Morgan Freeman is good in it too. The two of them together would be interesting.
user2: It seems like the TV reporter, Bruce Nolan, is complaining about his life and is kind of asking god why his life is that way.
user1: Jim Carey as God for a week. Sure to be good.
user2: Haha! Yeah I think that would be too. If he takes over god, then does "god" take over for Jim Carey?
user2: Or do you think that Jim Carey as god will just be dealing with everybody?
user1: He could make vengeance funny
user2: Yeah, maybe thats where karma comes from.
user1: I think the movie deals with karma, does it?
user1: nvrmnd
user1: thought the paragraph changed
user2: I think in this sense it can be Karma, haha. He has a girlfriend but is looking at another hence maybe why he is passed up on every success. 
user1: ah, like not appreciating what is around you, like in the movie
user2: yeah, like a self realization tactic.  
user2: Or it can be a pathway of these things happen because he chose this pathway and if he were to change his thoughts and opinions maybe it would lead to another pathway changing his bad luck.
user1: sounds like he gets there with morgan's help. this movie has some really great actors. 
user2: Yes, however, I am unsure of who is Philip Baker and Lisa Walter.
user1: Not sure either. So Bruce sets all the emails to answer yes to all requests. I wonder what people asked for.
user2: The things that people ask for vary. I mean it can be forgiveness, help, the extent of life. I mean I am a religious person but saying yes to everything seems a bit extravagant because what you ask for can affect a life of another.
user2: Just like how Bruce wanted that promotion and got the other rightful person fired. What is the person who got fired obtained that job because it was helping him take care of something meanningful like what is he had a sick wife or what not?
user1: Plus it might not really be what you need.
user1: Seems like its about the consequences of actions. I like to view movies as messages for the soul on how to (or not) live life.
user2: yeah, or maybe it teaches him again to be greatful for what he already has and to not be greedy because downfalls might be downfalls because it helps another person in dyer need. 
user2: It seems like we got the plot right on the nose. 
user1: That's a good way to look at when not so good things happen. 
user1: also some of these challenges help us determine what we really want
user1: vs choosing distractions
user2: yeah I think that we should all be greatfull from what we all have already within our lives like someone to love, family. shelter because other people in the world are unfortunate enough to have those.
user2: Although its hard to get past as seeing unluckiness as you need to look around and be greatful for what you already if you are that person youself.
user2: one should always strive for what they believe their heart follows though.
user2: Hello?
user1: yes and to stand up to bullies. Does Jim do that in this movie?
user1: sry, ladies room
user1: It seems like Grace was pretty patient with him
user2: Well Grace truely loved him aswell.
user1: and she finally got her wish
user2: That is good for her. I am happy to see that Jim Carey finally got himself to a true self realization of where he was suppose to be
user1: I think we'll all get there like Jim Carey did in the movie. Especially with the help of others.
user2: yeah, i guess its just the journey we all have to take through life.
user1: I wonder what message the homeless man had at the end of the movie. Looks like he was in the beginning of the movie with a message as well.
user1: Maybe he is symbolic.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello, Iwas wondering if you were a fan of Jim Carrey's movies?
user2: Yes I am! That guy is hilarious.
user2: Do you have one of his movies that is your favorite?
user1: I completely agree and would strongly suggest a movie that he did in 2003, starring Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston. It's about a down and out reporter that is complaining to god that he isn't doing his job correctly.
user2: What is the name of that movie? It sounds interesting to watch.
user1: It's called Bruce Almighty and I think that since you are a fan of his you are going to love this movie. Some critics have been harsh about this movie but just like most of his fans, I personally thought it had some really side splitting scenes and is a great movie overall.
user2: How was this movie compared to his other films? Is it more comical or more dramatic?
user1: The film is up there with majority of his other films and is more comical. There is some portions of it that have some dramatic parts, when it gets to the moral of the storyline. For the most part it his comedic for sure.
user2: Is there a love story mixed into the plot? I am wondering if it would be a good date movie to watch with someone.
user1: Yes there is, he is given the chance to become god himself for one week and part of the driving force that comes to leading him to complain to god so much is the issues that comes with relationship struggles.
user2: He gets to be God? That sounds interesting. Does the movie have some crazy CGI effects

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user2: Hey
user1: Have you ever seen the movie Bruce Almighty?
user2: Yeah!
user1: It's a great comedy that came out in 2003.
user1: Who is your favorite actor from it?
user2: Yeah, and it's a lot better than the sequel. 
user2: Steve Carrel 
user1: He's good. I really like Jim Carrey, this movie is one of his better ones. 
user2: Yeah, he was starting to slack after Man on The Moon
user1: True!
user2: Was Morgan Freeman in it?
user1: He is, He plays God. 
user1: Another reason why the movie is SO popular. Who doesn't like Morgan Freeman?
user2: Right
user2: Who else was in the movie?
user1: I like the movie because it shows Bruce as a regular person who has hopes and dreams of becoming big. He is in a relationship with JENNIFER ANISTON but has a crush on CATHERINE BELL (who rarely knows he lives)
user1: I think that can be the story of any of our lives
user1: Evan Baxter (STEVE CARRELL) gets the promotion and Bruce becomes God (woah)
user2: My favourite part is when Bruce takes control of Evan's speech and makes him talk gibberish
user1: That is a great part! Carrell and Carey are a great duo together
user2: They have a similar style of comedy
user1: Then when you put Jennifer Anistion in the mix, everyone's happy
user2: Eh, sometimes she's a little obnoxious in the stuff she acts in
user1: True but she deserves to be happy and Bruce sees that in the movie!
user2: You're right
user1: Bruce is able to change and adapt to be the person that she needs and they get engaged. 
user2: It's like a weird coming of age movie with middle aged adults
user1: It can be but it was and still is a popular movie that many people love to watch
user2: It was one of the last movies Jim Carrey did before kind of fading into obscurity
user1: Maybe that is why people always go and wath it
user1: Well have a great rest of your day!
user2: You too~

conversation:
user2: hi ..!
user1: Bruce Almighty is about a Tv reporter who complains his way into having to play god.
user2: Is that the movie? the one from 2003?
user1: Yes, its a comedy from 2003 starring Jim Carrey.
user2: I've heard it, but believe me I've never seen it
user2: Have you seen her?
user1: Yes, it also stars Morgan Freeman as God.
user2: really? then it must be very good ...
user1: Yes, It is very good. It has a CinemaScore A.
user2: wow ... should you tell me a bit about what exactly?
user1: It's one of Jim Carreys best films. He plays a tv reporter who hopes to one day become anchor. His coworkers see this as funny. He complains to God (morgan freeman) that god is not doing his job correctly, so god offers him to be god for a week.
user2: hahahaha, Jim Carrey as god a week would be something completely crazy
user2: but just for that reason does God grant you that?
user1: Yes, Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle.
user2: I have more problems  jhahahahha ... What other review do you have? without so much spoiler hahah
user1: Bruce (Jim Carrey) is in a relationship with Grace Conelly (Jennifer Aniston). But also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him.
user2: Jennifer Aniston!!? wow ..... hell, also problems in love
user1: Yes, and a week playing God.
user2: and exactly what happens with Susan?
user1: I don't know. But he does take Grace to a fancy diner to tell her about a new promotion. But he upsets her because she thought he was going to propose.
user2: That's wrong, ... so they're not married
user1: I don't know about marriage, but he does use his powers to cause his coworker, Evan Baxter to humiliate himself on Air which is why Bruce was given the promotion.
user2: then he definitely is not doing God's work very well
user1: After the missed proposal he starts to hear voices in his head. God tells him those are prayers. So he creates an e-mail system to receive prayers and respond to them. But there are so many he sets the program to automatically say yes to everyones prayer.
user2: It's a lot of responsibility ... and I guess that caused chaos, right?
user1: He also used his new powers to cause miraculous events to occur. Like discovering the body of Jimmy Hoffa or causing a meteor the harmlessly land near a cook-off.
user2: a meteor !!? definitely something crazy about power .. sounds very interesting haha
user1: God tells Bruce to pray for what he really wants. He prays Grace will find a man to make her truly happy. God agrees and then Bruce finds himself in the hospital just after being revived. Grace shows up and the reconcile.
user2: what??? hahaha good at least he came back with Jennifer
user1: Bruce returns to reporting but takes more pleasure in simple stories. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live television.
user2: great, thanks ... I definitely have to see this movie, it has everything, comedy, romance, ... thank you very much my friend
user1: Your Welcome. Keep your eye out at the end for the homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages that Bruce runs into previously.
user2: ok... thanks

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello
user1: We are talking about the movie Bruce Almighty. Have you seen it?
user2: I don't think so
user1: it's about a tv reporter who is down on his luck and complains to God.
user1: they guy is mad at God for not doing a better job, so God offers to let the guy try being God for a week. 
user1: What do you think?
user2: Sounds like it's a good movie
user2: who stars in it
user1: Jim Carrey plays the guy Bruce Nolan and Morgan Freeman plays God.
user2: I love Jim Carrey
user1: he has some really hilarious slapstick scenes in this movie.
user1: It came out in 2003.
user2: Wow so it's been out for a while.  Don't know how I missed that
user1: Jennifer Aniston plays the guy's girl friend and Steve Carell is his rival at the TV station.
user2: Some great actors are in this movie
user1: Catherine Bell is in it as well.
user2: I think I remember who she is.  I need to watch this movie
user1: I don't know her either, but with all of these great actors I would have expected higher ratings. Rotten Tomatoes only gave it a 48% review with an average of 5.7 out of 10.
user1: There are some really clever scenes. Like when Bruce discovers the body of Jimmy Hoffa and covers the story in order to get his job back.
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gets it wrong quite often.  I usually just make up my own mind.
user1: That's a good way to do it too.
user1: There is another scene where Bruce creates an email system to handle all of the prayers that God receives, and he sets it up to answer Yes to every prayer.
user2: Ha ha.  That's awesome.  If only that could really happen
user1: He is also trying to sabotage his coworker Evan in order to a promotion over Evan. 
user2: How is he trying to sabotage him.
user1: He does some different things to humiliate him on the set during a tv interview that cause Evan to get fired. 
user1: The relationship with the Jennifer Aniston character is pretty important too. God challenges Bruce ot pray for what he truly wants
user2: I'm sure it's funny though.  Jim Carrey is great
user1: There are some philosophical messages in this film too that make it more complex than the usual comedy.
user1: Bruce has some fun using his power to cause miraculous events.
user2: That's interesting especially for a JC movie
user1: The relationship between him and the Aniston character is rocky for awhile too, and Bruce prays that she finds a man that would really make her happy. That lands him in the hospital.
user1: (Sorry to spoil the whole plot for you.)
user2: That's okay.  I hope I get to watch it soon.
user1: The critics were kind of harsh saying that Bruce Almighty is funny but it gets slowed down by being so sappy.
user2: That does bother me.  If it's funny, I like it to remain funny
user1: They compared the Bruce character aspiring to be a big time news anchor with Jim Carry aspiring to be a "real" actor. Ouch.
user2: Oh geez...guess they were wrong
user1: heh... yea... he does alright. Anyone who can co-star with Morgan Freeman is doing alright.

conversation:
user1: I really liked this movie.
user2: Yeah, me too.
user2: But it got a very low rating in Roten Tomatoes.
user1: Oh really? I thought it was pretty popular with everyone
user1: That's suprising.
user2: Maybe some movie critic doesn't like this movie.
user1: I think Jim Carrey was really good in it. He isn't in that many movies lately.
user2: It got only 48% in rotten tomatoes.
user2: Yeah, he is so funny in this movie.

conversation:
user1: Hello? Are you still there?
user2: sey
user2: yes
user2: I am here.
user1: I was asking you about Morgan Freeman?
user2: Sorry, I never received a message.
user2: What about him?
user2: He plays God in the movie.
user1: Have you Seen Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey? Very funny movie?
user2: Yes, I have seen it.
user2: I thought so
user1: Did you like it? What was your favorite part?
user2: I liked it.
user2: I didn't really have a favorite part
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: Morgan Freeman played God. Jim Carrey has a run of bad luck and God tells him that maybe he could do a better job. . 
user2: I love Jim Carrey. He is hilarious
user1: He definitely made the movie. And the supporting actors were great. When he wanted to seduce his girlfriend and pulled the moon closer to the window. The next morning found there was flooding worldwide.
user1: I also liked how he got the dog to use and flush the toilet.
user2: Jim Carrey is always a hoot.
user2: funny
user1: Do you remeber when he started hearing prayers in his head? He tried to say yes  to all of them.
user2: Yes I do remember
user1: I also liked when he had discussions with Morgan Freeman and was walking on water. . .
user2: Morgan Freeman makes the movie also
user1: He also played wonderfully with Steve Carrell. Steve is the anchorman that accepted the job that Bruce wanted on air.
user2: Yes, he did. Steve Carrel is super funny.
user1: He used his God powers to make a fool of Steve on the news.
user2: Yes, when he stole dialogue
user1: Yes.  Bruce also started to win the job by being on interviews when the body of Jimmy Hoffa was found. . 
user1: Also, a meteor just happens land near a cookoff competition that he is covering. . .
user2: I don't recall that part.
user1: Do you recall the monkey part?
user2: No, refresh my memory.
user1: He went back to a gang in a n alley that had stolen from him earlier.  He used his powers to make a monkey come out of the gang leader's rear.  It was a really funny scene.

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hi
user1: Were you given a passage to read or did you watch a video
user2: I have a passage on Bruce Almighty
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: I see, yes I have seen it! It's a funny movie. What did you think?
user2: I did like it a lot
user2: I do not agree with the ratings listed here
user1: What do the ratings say?
user2: Rotten tomatoes had 48% and 5.7 out of 10
user2: It does not list IMDb though
user1: Wow those are some mediocre ratings. I think some of the humor may have flown over the reviewers heads.
user2: I agree... The transformation by Carrey's character was very funny
user1: Yeah, I really wish he would make more movies again. He is a great actor in my opinion. Do you agree?
user2: Now that you mention it, I have not seen him in any films in a while... I wonder what happened?
user1: From the last thing I saw about him on YouTube, he was done with hollywood and just living his life as a normal day to day person. People have rumored he may be going through depression, but I can totally understand why a celebrity would want to step out of the spotlight after some time.
user2: That totally makes sense to me.
user1: Have you seen the sequel to Bruce Almighty?
user2: Even Almighty, right?
user2: Evan!
user1: yeah! I thought that one was hilarious too..
user2: I have only seen bits a pieces of it, but anything with Steve Carell in it is usually pretty good.
user1: haha, yeah.
user2: And having Morgan Freeman in any film is always a good idea.. :)
user1: That voice.. such a authoritative voice...
user1: ...Jennifer Aniston was in Bruce Almighty right?
user2: I hardly remember her, because Carrey's character was so into the other woman
user1: oh yeah...
user1: Hmm.. I'm not sure how to complete this task.. is this on a timer or is it counting how many messages we send back and forth to eachother?
user2: I think it is a combination of the two
user2: But I could be wrong
user1: ah, ok.. Do you enjoy Mturk?
user1: oh there we go

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello,
user2: How are you today?
user1: I'm quite ok, You ? ;)
user2: Good. i am looking for a recommendation on a movie..
user2: Know any good ones?
user1: ahh yes, Are You a fan of Jim Carrey ?
user2: I do like him , yes.
user1: Well I just watched a movie Bruce Almighty - a little older position but still very good
user1: Have You seen it ?
user2: I think I know it.
user2: Is it the ones with morgan freeman as god?
user1: Yes sir ;) who could be better than Mr. Freeman as God ;)
user2: I think that was smart and fun casting.
user2: He is in everything. Kind of like god, lol.
user1: I agree  :)  and I like that pair - Jim Carrey and Jennifer Anniston... they should act more together
user2: I don't recall that much their chemistry.
user2: What was jim carrey's role again?
user1: He was this guy who really wanted to be an anchor but his colleagues at work were always better than him and he felt like all this is unjust and he would make a better job as God ;)
user2: Ah yes.. obviously named bruce .
user1: "that's how the cookies crumbles" was his saying in news ;)
user2: I like that.. so cute
user2: Now I want a cookie.
user1: Jim's acting was as always outstanding and hilarious ;)
user2: yes I agree.
user1: cookies are good for everything ;)
user2: Who else was in it, I think there was some other big name..
user2: no?
user1: Jennifer Aniston of course - I think she was awesome as a date for Jim ;)
user2: She is very likable.
user2: And I know we already discussed morgan but I thought there was someone else.
user1: yes - I've never considered her  "sexy" until I saw Horrible Bosses ;)
user2: LOL
user2: She is more girl next door.
user1: ha ;)
user2: Am I wrong on ther ebeing some other famous person?
user2: Sorry just bothering me, you know I just can't put my finger on it.
user1: Philip Baker Hall but I don't really consider him that famous ;)
user2: No never heard of him.
user1: yeah, just those three were actually famous ;)
user2: Oh well guess I am thinking of some other movie maybe.
user1: could be ;)
user1: allright I think we are done ;)
user2: Steve carell
user2: that is who I am thinking of, wasn't he in it?
user1: naah :) not in this one :) I think part 2
user2: I did not even know there was a part 2.
user2: Alrighty then
user2: Nice chattting
user2: bye.
user1: yes in 2007
user1: k, bb ;)

conversation:
user1: I really liked this movie I think it was well done. 
user2: Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes
user1: I really liked Morgan Freeman as God. I just watched Evan last night
user2: If I just went by the Rotten Tomatoes score of 48% I probably would not have watched this movie
user1: I normally don't even pay any attention to the rotten tomatoes score. It the last thing I look at. 
user1: Do you like slapstick movies?
user2: It is nice to have reviews by both critics and movie goers to get a feel for the movie.  I am not a big slapstick fan, but Morgan Freeman helps to give this movie some grounding so it's not all dumb humor.
user1: Yes I totally agree with the Morgan Freeman being a great ground. He is such a good actor. 
user2: Of course his voice makes a great "God"
user1: What would you rate this movie?
user2: Probably a 7/10 
user1: I would agree with that. 
user1: Do you think that this movie could ever really happen?
user2: Not sure if Jennifer Aniston makes sense in this film as the girlfriend
user1: Who would you rather have seen in this, if she is not the ideal 
user2: That question gets into religion and philosophy so I guess I would have to say no.
user1: I completely understand that,. 
user2: It would be interesting if it was someone funny.  They put 2 male comic actors together but usually not a male and female.
user2: Now I would like the powers that Jim Carrey had in the movie
user1: The restaurant scene was really funny, I liked that the voices kept getting in the way. 
user2: His email solution to the prayers sounds like being stuck on an automated phone system
user1: Ha yeah but getting what you wanted all the time. 
user1: Having those powers would be awesome
user2: Unless yes doesn't answer your question!
user1: So that brings us to the ending. What did you think about how it ended?
user2: The ending seems more like a rom-com.
user2: A bit too cliche
user1: Everything works out and now one gets hurt. 
user2: That's the movies - not life.
user1: Yeah in real life there would be no job now girl and no dog. 
user2: Glad to get this movie and not a superhero one I don't know anything about.
user1: Maybe just the dog
user2: I'll take the dog or cat... less drama
user2: Are you a movie buff?
user1: yeah less drama is good. 
user1: I like the old ones. 
user1: Pre 1960
user2: Think I'l still stuck in the 80s
user2: I'm
user1: Where everyone had money. 
user2: They didn't have the special effects back before '60 so actually had to have substance

conversation:
user2: Hello. Have you ever seen "Bruce Almighty"?
user1: Yeah, it's not a bad movie.  I love Jim Carey
user1: Carrey.  Do you like Jim Carrey?\
user2: I pretty much agree with your view of the movie. I USED to be a big fan of Jim Carrey. Not so much anymore though.
user1: I'll always love Jim Carrey.  I've loved him since I was a kid back in the "In Living Color" days.  There's a sequel, Evan Almighty with Steve Carrell, and they are both in a movie together called BURT WONDERSTONE.  
user1: Did you know it got a cinema score of an A?
user2: I've seen Evan Almighty. Bruce Almighty is definitely better. Never seen Burt Wonderstone.
user2: I think it depends on WHO is scoring it. Critics never liked the movie but the fans DID.
user1: You should watch it.  Classic as can be.  Steve Buscemi is in it also.  That's true.  If you like certain actors, it's hard to not like anything they do.
user1: Morgan Freeman as god is pretty fun, also. lol
user2: It's a real shame Carrey seems to have fallen apart recently. I did enjoy a lot of his movies, "Liar, Liar" "The Mask" "Bruce Almighty,"...
user2: I don't think I've ever seen something where I didn't like Morgan Freeman in it. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hello have you seen Bruce almighty
user2: No, whats it about?
user1: it is a pretty good movie with Morgan Freeman,Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston
user1: it is a comedy
user2: Oh, what type of movie is it?
user1: comedy
user2: Oh gotcha, is it more adult humor, or immature humor?
user1: Jim carrey plays a tv reporter
user1: adult humor
user2: Hmm how long is it?
user1: couple of hours
user2: was it good?
user1: he is a tv reporter that wants to be a news anchor his girlfriend is played by Jennifer Aniston
user1: yes it was real funny
user1: he has a lot of bad luck
user2: What do you mean?
user1: it seems like everything he does he screws everything up
user2: Oh, that does sound funny. Should I see it?
user1: they say it is one of Jim Carrey's best films
user1: yes
user2: Dang. When did it come out?
user1: 2003
user2: So its getting pretty old
user1: Morgan Freedman plays God
user2: No way?
user1: yep he gives Jim Carey his powers to be God
user2: What else happens in it?
user1: when he gets Gods powers he realizes it is not that easy to be God 
user2: Does he do anything funny as god?
user1: he hears all the peoples prays around the world and he has to decide whose prayers he is going to answer
user2: Wow that would be a hard decision. Who does he listen to?
user1: oh yes he trys to make his girlfriends chest bigger
user1: he heard all the people around the world
user2: Does he do anything else interesting?
user1: ok you have a good day you should defintley see it
user2: Thanks, you too

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: hello there, do you like watching comedy movies?
user1: it depends on which actors are in it
user1: what movie did you read about?
user2: Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman
user1: oh ive seen that movie
user1: it was good
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gave it only 48%, although CinemaScore gave it an A.  I have watched it multiple times and thought it was very funny
user2: I would agree with CinimaScore giving it an A, do you put into account critic/website scores when watching movies?
user1: yea definitely
user1: i think rotten tomatoes were more harsh on their reviews years ago compared to today
user1: what was the main problem of the movie again?
user2: God wasnt answering Bruce's prayers of being famous and God gave Bruce his powers to try to be God for 1 week
user2: He gets angry at his co worker "Evan Baxter" played by Steve Carell and forces him to mess up on air
user1: oh right
user1: that was pretty fresh

conversation:
user2: hello!
user2: Could you tell me the title of the movie?
user1: Hello!
user1: Bruce Almighty is the movie
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: I see. I heard a lot of good things about the film. Tell me a little about the film. Who is in it?
user1: Jim Carrey is the main character, Bruce.
user1: He starts off as a reporter who is pretty ungrateful 
user2: Aha. I like Jim Carrey. Funny guy! Imagine him being a reporter. 
user1: He complains to God about his problems. 
user2: Okay that sounds interesting. Why is he so ungrateful?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user1: Do you have a movie to discuss?
user2: lets talk about bruce almighty
user2: have you seen it?
user1: ok, no I haven't see it
user1: I think it's about a guy who becomes God or something
user2: Yeah, its probably one of Jim Carrey's best films
user1: Who are the main actors played by
user1: Not a fan
user2: at least that what all of the reviewers say lol
user2: it's got Morgan Freeman in it, so that saves the movie from people who cant stand Carrey
user1: Morgan Freeman is definitely a good thing
user2: he's actually pretty funny in this movie
user2: but its a hit or miss tbh
user2: you can tell by the 48% rotten tomatoes score
user1: I saw (the existence of) some documentary on Netflix recently that Carrey is a changed person since playing that Latka guy
user1: if you know what I'm talking about
user1: Andy Kaufman 
user1: That sounds vaguely interesting to me
user1: But back to this film
user2: wow, never would have guessed it. I think it was because this movie was on the edge of his prime
user1: who are the women actors?
user2: Jennifer Aniston was in it
user1: really, I like her also. She is very subtle
user2: yeah, she plays the girlfriend in the movie
user1: Ah, did they have children in the film?
user2: No children
user2: But Steve Carrell plays his boss
user2: he has a pretty big role in the movie too
user1: really, he's interesting also. I just saw some movie with him in the last few days
user2: Yeah, but he is not as funny in this movie as he is in the movies he stars in
user1: I like that one best where he is with that cute Ryan guy
user1: Gosling, I think
user1: Not sure of the name
user2: There isn't much eye candy in this Bruce Almighty unfortunately lol
user1: Hmn, I can see him playing uptight characters
user1: Jim Carrey. Comedy. No man candy. Why I didn't see it.
user2: yeah, and Carrey gets annoying in most of his movies
user2: he kind of treads that territory in this movie
user2: overdoes it and stuff
user1: annoying overdoes it is a good definition of him
user1: that's his shtick
user2: because its supposed to be like god is controlling him...so it gives him an oppurtunity to act like an idiot lol
user1: Sp?
user1: Huh?
user2: thats what happens to his character in the movie
user2: morgan freeman plays god
user1: god controls his actions so his actions are dumb?
user2: because god wants to spite him or something
user2: so he makes him embarasse himself in public
user1: ah, haha god

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hi!
user1: Have you seen Bruce Almighty yet?!?
user2: I have seen that movie, yes.
user1: Jim Carrey is hysterical in that movie

conversation:
user2: Hey there. Have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: Yeah, but it's a been a while. You a fan? 

conversation:
user1: What movie did you read about?
user2: I would definitely recommended seeing Bruce Almighty. Jim Carey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes.
user1: Who else is in the movie?
user2: Morgan Freeman
user1: Is there a romantic part of the story?
user2: Basically Carey complains God (Morgan Freeman) is not doing his job.
user2: Jennifer Anniston plays as Carey's love interest.
user2: It has a rotten tomatoes score of 48%
user1: Is there a sequel?
user2: Not noted in the document.
user1: When was the movie made?
user2: 2003
user1: What happens after he complains about God?
user2: Carey is offered a chance to be Good, which is where the comedy really ensues.
user2: God*
user1: Is this film appropriate for all ages?
user2: The document does not state.
user1: Are their any other side plots?
user1: there*
user2: Carey competes with Steve Carrel for recognition from the news Network they work for which is hilarious.
user1: What is his job at the news network?
user2: One of my favorite scenes is when Carey uses his powers as God to humiliate Carrel on a live broadcast.
user2: Carey is a television field reporter.
user1: Are there any sad or dramatic parts to the film?
user2: I would say the biggest drama is the competition between Carey and Carrel.
user2: It is also sad when Carey and Anniston break up during the movie.
user1: How does the plot resolve?
user2: I don't have that part of the document.
user1: did the critics like this film?
user2: Metacritic was 46/100 and the Cinema score was A

user2: New York

conversation:
user2: I am looking at  information about the movie Bruce Almighty
user1: Jim Carey is Bruce Nolan in the movie, so I bet it is funny!
user2: The rating says rotten tomatoes 48% with a rating of 5.7 out of 10. Thats really surprising as most of Carreys movies are extremely funny.
user1: Yes, I agree and The Critics response is He is hilarious in the slapstick scenes
user2: Morgan Freeman stars in it as well.
user1: Not to mention Jennifer Aniston
user2: Oh yeah Jennifer Aniston is always good in anything she stars in. 
user1: Agreed, and Morgan Freeman is a favorite of mine
user2: Imagine getting to be God. Aint that a riot. I have never saw a bad Morgan Freeman movie
user1: I know Right? but I am not familiar with the director Tom Shadyac
user2: The info we have is calling this one of Jims best movies wonder why it is rated so low. I have never heard of him til now. 
user2: I wonder if he directs all of Jim Carreys movies. 
user1: Could be? I see that Steve Carell is in the movie
user2: His name doesnt ring a bell but Im sure I would recognize him if I saw him. 
user1: Are you speaking of steve carell? I think he played in the movie Evan Almighty
user1: Im pretty sure..
user2: This is our first movie information page. Im not sure how we are supposed  to proced. I know it said we to interact with each other 5 times at least. Yes Carrell doesnt he play in the tv show The Office.?
user2: Yes that was a funny movie too. 
user1: I dont know either haha and yes you are correct
user2: Im gonna try to look at the instruction for this hit . I will be back in a minute dont leave. Ok
user1: I am reading about the key scenes
user1: ok
user1: so in the 1st scene he is liking 2 woman uh oh..bad news right ther and the 2nd scene is mentioning powers that cause crazy stuff and he starts hearing voices 
user2: You know I did not see those at first I did take time to read them now. The voices are prayers that people are praying to God. He doesnt want to deal with it so he says yes to all the prayers. 
user1: he then creates a email system to receive prayers and winds up answering yes to every prayer
user2: Yes that is funny
user1: welcome back btw
user2: Thanks 
user1: Aw in scene 3 he prays for grace to find a man that makes her happy
user2: I see how it works now it adds a little bit of info every few minutes . Yes that was a tear jerker part for me. 
user1: wow! then he is in the hospital? I wonder what happened
user2: I dont know but it says he was revived
user1: so a near death or dead then alive kinda thing?
user2: Sounds like he learned a lesson about himself though be cause it says he changes his style of reporting and proposes to Grace  during his news report.
user1: That is cool they reconciled and wound up getting married! I  agree he learned a valuable lesson
user1: oops i mean engaged
user2: It says that there is a homeless man at the end of the movie that Bruce ran into during various parts of the movie. I remember seeing the homeless guy at the end but not during the movie. 
user1: really? I never saw the movie, but after reading about it and chatting with you I will !
user2: Hey I think we can finish now. It was really good discussing Bruce Almighty with you. Reallly you never saw it.???
user1: Nope but I saw evan almighty :)

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: hello
user1: I loved carrey in this one
user1: you ever seen it?
user1: Of course they cast Morgan Freeman as god
user2: yes it was so funny
user1: perfect role
user1: Rotten tomatoes gave this a 48 holy crap
user1: thats so bad
user1: who'd you like in it?
user2: a lot of times I don't listen to critics
user1: yeah
user2: Jim Carrey
user1: for sure
user1: the goat
user1: I don't remember Phillip Baker
user2: me neither
user1: Maybe he was one of the anchors
user1: dang this was 15 years ago
user1: 2003
user1: "B.A gets bogged down in treacle"
user1: british term for molasses.. sounds not fun
user2: Steve Carell was funny also
user1: It's weird that carell isn't listed on this sheet
user1: under cast
user1: Even though he was very memorable
user1: Any other comments on this sheet?
user2: he is in the top paragraph in small print under key scenes
user1: yeah i see taht
user1: i just think him not being under the cast part is weird
user2: I agree
user1: Never knew bruce's last name was nolan. I thought it was almighty
user2: lol
user1: dang multiple romantic interests in this one
user1: all i remember is the semi religious parts
user1: I'd think under 'critical response' that the church would be offended
user2: I love the part when he embarrasses Evan on the news 
user1: yeah
user1: carrel did that perfectly
user2: yep
user1: Cinemascore: A
user1: Cinamascore obviously does not care about the other critics
user1: metacritic 46/100 yikes
user1: it would be cool if we died and morgan freeman was waiting 
user2: I don't remember the part where he discovers Jimmy Hoffa
user1: oh man
user1: me either
user2: yes it would be I think he would be a fun God
user1: at least a reasonable one
user1: yeah the meteor part was fun
user1: I wish I could name another "Tom Shadyac" movie
user1: sounds like 1 hit wonder
user2: That would be cool to be God for a week like Bruce did

conversation:
user2: Hi, Bruce Almighty sounds like a good movie. 
user1: I've seen it before a couple times, I really liked it
user2: Jim Carrey plays Bruce. He can be funny...
user2: It was released in 2003? Wow, it's been a while.
user1: Yeah I think he's really funny but now he's kind of doing an artistic thing
user1: yeah it makes me feel old
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Yes. Long time ago....
user1: What was your favorite part
user2: Jennifer Aniston was the girlfriend...I forgot about that.
user1: Yeah I think I didn't even know who she was when I first watched the movie
user2: Parting of the sea was probably my favorite part...
user1: When I rewatched it is when I realized it was her
user1: I'm surprised it didnt get better ratings
user2: It only has 48% Rotten tomatoes.
user1: I thought it was a great idea
user1: for a movie
user2: Morgan Freeman is a perfect actor for the part.
user1: Did you see the sequel of spinoff with Steven Carrell
user1: He did Evan Almighty
user1: I feel like that was more meant for kids though
user2: Evan Almighty? I liked it better actually.
user1: I didn't think it was as good
user1: But maybe thats because I was a kid when I saw Bruce Almighty
user1: I feel like Jim Carrey was the best actor for the part
user2: Bruce learned using the power comes with responsibility and consequences.
user1: sure did
user1: A lot of memes on the internet have come from that movie
user2: Can't say yes to all prayers...not always a good thing.
user1: I thought the part with the filing cabinet was funny
user2: Yeah...
user1: And the sticky notes
user2: I have totally forgotten that Steve Carell was in this movie too...
user1: yeah he was like the better newsman or something
user2: That's right!
user1: i liked the part where jim carrey made steve carrell mess up all his words
user2: Oh, yeah, that was funny! Like he couldn't talk 
user2: Pretty funny acting 
user1: Yeah and the stuff he was doing to give himself better news stories

conversation:
user1: Hello there!
user2: Hey there
user1: hope day going well. did you just watch a movie?
user2: Are you intersted in the movie Bruce Almighty? It stars Jim Carrey , Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston
user1: Oh that sounds like something I would like, is it a comedy?
user2: Oh yeah...it's funny. Jim Carrey isn't doing too well at his job as a TV reporter, so he compalined to God that he was not doing his job correctly, so God bet him he couldn't do his job as God for a week.
user1: oh that sounds pretty interesting and appealing! I do like those actors and actresses too!
user1: how are the ratings?
user2: Surprisingly, 48% with Rotten Tomatoes, 46/100 Metacritic Score but the CinemaScore was an A
user1: little bit all over there place there. so does he do good as being god?
user2: Well, the critics think he lost his focus, but it was certainly hilarious!
user1: I may have to look into it! what was one of your favorite scenes?
user2: OH yeah, I forgot that Steve Carell was in this as the guy he lost his promotion to.
user1: I like steve carell , he is normally pretty funny too
user2: Yeah... i think there was a scene where he made a fool of himself over this girl he had a crush on
user2: very slapstick funny
user1: is morgan freeman a main character? 
user2: steve carell was very mean at the same time. There was one part where he stole Bruce's speech when accepting the promotion.
user1: i just wondered since u said he takes over gods position.
user2: Yes, Morgaqn Fr3eeman is God himself
user1: thats a great person to play character of god with his calm voice
user2: Definitely a great pick
user1: how old is the movie?
user2: Bruce used his position as god to get great stories to try to get his standing back as an anchor. plus he sabotaged steve carell's character several times
user2: the movie is from 2003...so 15 years! 
user1: wow, pretty old then.   so he is abusing the power of god... does he help anyone or do any good?
user2: He discovered the body of Jimmy Hoffa? lol
user2: He also intercepted a meteor
user1: I had to google jimmy Hoffa lol  
user1: so he does a bit of good, is there a moral to the movie tho at the end , a purpose?
user2: aww lol
user2: He finally learned a lesson that life was good just the way he had it. So he calmed down a bit and settled down with his girlfriend
user1: I will have to rent it for sure!
user2: yeah..i must see it again

conversation:
user2: Have you ever seen Bruce Akmighty?
user1: hey whats happening
user2: Almighty 
user1: yes, 
user2: Apparently it sucks. Rotten tomatoes have it a 48% eating
user2: Eating
user2: Sorry pc keeps changing it rating 
user1: that movie was funny as hell
user2: Yes but it didn't utilize jim Carey's talents
user1: it was alot better than the second one
user1: true, carey is an amazing talent
user2: He is great in slapstick scenes but Bruce almighty had too many "serious" moments
user1: totally agree
user2: His character Bruce is in a serious relationship but likes someone else in the movie.
user2: If you have Jennifer Aniston why would you want someone else? People didn't like that
user1: they tried to push a message way too hard
user1: jennifer is smoking hot 
user1: she is a very good actress
user2: That's true. Be satisfied with your life. I think a lot of people need and deserve promotions like Bruce so saying it doesn't matter and to be happy probably upset people
user2: Saying yes to every prayer probably made people question the believability in the movie. Heading voices was also a turn of events 
user1: i try to be satisfied with what i have. you can learn from that movie
user2: Making miraculous events happen to help his job seem to fall flat to the reviewers. 
user1: he had way to much on his plate and people dont realize what must go on when people ask god non stop
user1: reviewers always complain
user2: Making Evan who did not do anything wrong be fired from his job was also mean spirited. 
user1: sometimes the reviews are the reason i watch a movie.
user2: The part where it revealed that the homeless man outside the new station was God was also cliche
user1: yea i noticed that
user2: Plus Bruce dies  and is revived and then him and grace announce their marriage was a typical bad things happen then happy and movie cliche 
user1: yeah but it wasnt that bad.
user2: He learns to be happy with the little stores instead of main news anchor probably made people cringe. Felt like an after school special
user2: Stories 

conversation:
user1: So, what movie did you see?
user2: Bruce Almighty!
user2: You should definitely give it a try.
user1: Was it any good?
user1: I guess you answered already!
user2: Although it only got a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes, I thought it was pretty funny!
user1: What was it about?
user2: Jim Carrey is the main actor - if you are familiar. It is a comedy about this guy, Bruce, who complains to God because things aren't going great in his life right now. So, God gives him a chance at being God for a week.
user2: Jennifer Aniston is also part of the cast. :)
user1: Carrey is hilarious. I don't know if I trust critics. A lot of great movies get bad reviews.
user1: Jennifer Aniston is hot. Hotter than Anjelina Jolie. I don't know what Brad Pitt was thinking.
user2: I typically trust Rotten Tomatoes. Normally I do enjoy the movies that they give high ratings to. But there have been a bunch of times where I really liked a low rated movie!
user2: LOL
user2: Jennifer Aniston literally does not age. She looks as good as she did when she was on Friends. Maybe even better...
user1: So what does he do as God?
user2: God, played by Morgan Freeman (which I think is great), truly gives Bruce all of his powers. At first he is completely swept up by all of the limitless powers he has and uses them to his advantage.
user1: Morgan Freeman was made to play God. That voice. George Burns wasn't but redefined who God is.
user2: Yes, totally agree!
user2: So, Bruce begins to hear all of these voices in his head. They are prayers from around the world. He is sp overwhelmed by all of the prayers that he creates a prayer email system and just replies "yes" to all of the prayers. lol
user1: Jim Carrey seems to do well with these type of plots. Liar Liar was hilarious. In that movie, he is a liar who suddenly cannot tell a lie. literally. 
user1: Ha ha. Prayer email automated reply system!
user2: I completely forgot that that was the plot of Liar Liar! That's funny. Similar concept.
user2: Bruce Almighty was released in 2013 - 15 years ago! I imagine Liar Liar is even older than that.
user1: Yeah, its an old one. So does he save the world at the end or something?
user1: I'll probably check it out, being that I liked Liar Liar.
user2: Not quite :) But he does get it all figured out! He figures out the power of prayer and he himself prays that Jennifer Anistons character will find happiness. In the movie, they are in a relationship but it is complicated and messy.
user2: But through prayer, they find their way back to eachother. They get engaged. They live happily ever after!
user2: Yeah, its a pretty good movie! It is an easy watch.
user1: Ah, messy relationship. "we were on a break!"
user2: Ha!
user2: Essentially, yes.
user1: Easy watches are necessary, I don't think critics get that sometimes.
user2: I don't think so either! Sometimes you just want to have a good laugh.

conversation:
user2: Jim Carey was amazing in his role in Bruce Almighty
user1: I agree! What did you think of his character?
user2: He was very fitting for the character and quite hilarious! 
user1: I really liked his slapstick humor, and his portrayal of Bruce Nolan, the news reporter.
user2: Morgan Freeman was also quite amazing too! 
user2: His humor is always off the charts! 
user1: Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors in the movie, and often seems to portray God in other movies.
user2: he does and plays it very well in every one of them
user1: Despite the Rotten Tomatoes score of 48%, I really enjoyed the movie overall, and think more people should see it.
user2: I think it was great and more often then not I don't find the critics agreeing with me. 
user1: They seem to often view it purely from a cinematic standpoint, and not from an enjoyment standpoint.
user2: This is very true they are also quite critical of little things that the general consenus finds of little importance.
user1: What did you think of the relationship between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace Connelly, who was played by Jennifer Aniston?
user2: I love jennifer aniston shes is a great actor all around, and pretty cute too! 
user1: How did you feel about Steve Carell's performance as Evan Baxter, Bruce's rival?
user2: He played the part good, the jackass he is great for. 
user1: I really despised his character when he stole dialogue from Bruce and then stole his promotion.
user1: I also liked how Bruce was given power to combat the bad luck he had all his life.
user2: Yes that was pretty cool that he was given that power and the ability to battle back against his luck. Many never get that chance! 
user2: And the theft of his promotion was horrible! 
user1: I agree! Bruce does end up getting revenge though, when he uses his powers to make Evan humiliate himself, and Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.
user2: He does and that was one of my favorite parts! 
user1: What did you think of Bruce inventing an email system to deal with all the prayers he was receiving?
user2: Impressive wasnt it?
user1: I thought it was quite funny when he automated the system, and had it answer yes to every prayer, which lead to a lot of funny moments.
user1: One of the most touching scenes was when Bruce speaks to God for the final time, and he prays for Grace to find a man that will make her happy.
user1: And then Bruce comes back to life and sees her there in the hospital.
user2: Oh yeah I forgot about that, it was really touching and supportive of his wish! 
user2: All in all though it was a really good movie and pretty positive. Jim carrey def made it far more hilarious than another actor could have done
user1: I thought the message of enjoying what you have was very powerful, and was supported by Bruce returning to field reporting, but enjoying it much more.
user1: And I very much agree that Jim Carrey is the perfect actor for this movie
user2: Very much so, and that thought isn't held very dear with society anymore. 

conversation:
user1: Good morning . Have you seen one of the funniest comedies Bruce Almighty
user2: no
user1: do you like comedies. Do you like movies with jim carey
user2: yes i like comedy movies
user1: This is one of the older ones of Jim Carey. Unfortunately, it didn
user1: Sorry accidentally hit the enter button. It didn't get very good reviews from rotten tomatoes or metacritic. 
user2: why is not a good comedy movie
user2: what is the movie about
user1: I don't think they appreciated the humor. It is slapstick comedy. and the critic says it gets bogged down in the treacle.
user1: the movie is about bruce who is an anchorman at news station and he is upset and complains to God. He gets to be God for a week. I rather enjoyed it personally
user1: It came out 2003 you should definitely watch it especially if you are not sure and on a rainy day
user1: it is good for all ages
user2: sounds like fun movie
user2: How Jim Carrey acted in this  movie
user1: He did a good job. It wasn't his best movie but definitely would recommend it. I watched it personally 3 different times. I like comedies and I love jim carey.
user2: Since this is comedy movie I will definitely watch it
user2: sorry watch it
user1: I don't think you will be disappointed
user1: The cinema score gave an A for the movies
user2: who else acted in this movie
user1: I don't know how much you follow the ratings or review them . Just in case I thought I would share
user1: Jennifer Aniston Catherine bell MOrgan Freeman
user2: all of them are great actors
user1: he is God morgan freeman > I love him too side note.   STeve carell
user1: yes I agree and suprised you haven't see it

user2: LOL
user2: you are the one with the information
user2: x)
user1: ah i get it now
user2: could you tell me a little about it?
user2: the story, the cast...
user1: its about this newscaster guy who has a lot going for him but not everything
user1: the newscaster is Jim Carrey
user1: and one day he goes to and meets with a guy who is in all white Morgan Freeman
user1: and Freeman is presumptually god in the situation which i mean is a pretty acurate portrayal of his actual self
user2: morgan freeman doing god job right?
user1: my text in the chat wont upload quick so i cant necessarily se what youre saying but ill keep explaining the movie
user1: and yes he is haha and he gives his powers to jim carreys haracter
user1: Carrey has a tough time at first but when he starts to get the hang of things he really starts doing some interesting things
user1: like blwoing up a girls skirt and make J anistons breasts bigger.. lol and he also pulls the moon closer, has a monkey come out of a gangbangers but and a plethora of other funy situations 
user2: lol
user2: you really payed attention to the movie!
user1: well it ends up finding a way to do good with his powers and realizes everthing he wanted were just things and that they were a foolish pursuit esppecially if he wanted to be happy
user1: ive seen it like 50 times its a great one i love Jim Carrey haha
user2: It seems a real great movie.
user1: overall i thought it was a great movie but it appears according to the little cheat sheet i got here that it only got a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 47 metacritic score but a A for cinema score
user2: Need to watch it ASAP
user1: its a funny one for sure 
user2: YA the ratings were a little harsh on the movie
user1: d
user2: But it´s difficult to find a comedy movie to be really highly praised by critics
user2: they usually do not find comedy movies to be piece of arts
user1: definately like when he pulls the moon closer for his romantic evening all is well but then the next day you can hear a tv in the backround and its all like the tids have changed and hella towns are flooding and stuff
user1: i agree comedies get rated tough haha hey can you finish the convo now? 
user1: i might proceed to the next hit if ya feel me haha

user2: i would recommend you watching it. it seems to be very humorous
user1: ok i will
user2: i think it is. i am finishing
user1: ok thank you.
user1: this is fun.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Good afternoon
user2: Would you like to see " Bruce All mighty"?
user2: This is a great movie, defiantly worth watching it.
user2: This is a high concept comedy.

conversation:
user2: I just watched Bruce Almighty.
user1: Awesome, did you like it?
user2: Yeah, I thought it was really funny.  Jim Carrey was great.
user1: I haven't seen it yet. I do like Jim Carrey though. 
user2: He was really good.  Morgan Freeman was in it too.  He played God.
user1: I think Morgan Freeman is a great actor. Who else is in it?
user2: Jennifer Aniston plays Grace, Jim's wife.
user1: Great cast so far. Is it family friendly? 
user2: Definitely.  It's a comedy with some slapstick and would be enjoyable for families.
user1: Are there some adult joke? Do you think it's appropriate for a child under 13?
user1: I'm down for a good comedy but would like to watch with my daughter. 
user2: I think a child under 13 would enjoy it.  
user2: There are some good scenes like when he loses the promotion to his rival Evan.  Your daughter would like that scene.\
user1: Thanks for giving me the heads up.
user1: It's hard to find good movies to watch with kids :-)
user2: The rating on rotten tomatoes aren't that great, but I think they aren't giving it enough credit.  It was very funny.
user1: I don't like rotten tomatoes that's a place for people with no taste, lol. 
user1: What did you take away from the movie? any moral?
user1: I love a movie with a good moral 
user2: Yeah, it had a good message.  Bruce becomes God and has to answer everyone's prayers, and he finds it is overwhelming to him.  He decides to say Yes to every one.  
user2: It is an interesting way of explaining why you can't always have a prayer answered.
user1: Wow, that's a good moral especially nowadays. 
user1: It doesn't sound overtly religious and sounds like a fun movie. Doesn't sound offensive either! 
user2: Definitely.  It also shows how having infinite power does not answer all your questions.  Bruce disappoints his girlfriend by only thinking about himself and taking her to dinner about his promotion when she thought it was about a proposal
user1: Ouch, awkward. 
user1: I'm going to assume he comes to his senses as she gives him another change? I like a happy ever after movie too :-) 
user2: He prays to God to give Grace a man she deserves and she winds up back with Bruce.
user2: He also tones down his need for being the best at work, and accepts a more humble position.
user1: Thanks for the info. I like when they can take a character and turn them around in the end. 
user2: Yeah, he definitely did and learned a lot.
user2: The movie ends with a homeless man holding a philosophical sign.
user2: It was a deep movie for a comedy.
user1: yeah it is deep! nice ending
user1: Thank you for giving me more info :-) 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user1: So what do you think of the movie?
user2: So personally i love Bruce almighty its a feel good movie and i thinks its enjoyable  
user1: It was alright to me. Not my favorite but it was good.
user2: Jim Carrey as Bruce is as usual hilarious 
user1: I personally thought Evan Almighty was better.
user2: I loved that movie more than bruce
user1: Just seems that Jim Carrey tries to hard sometimes. 
user1: Steve Carrel is more naturally funny 
user2: But Jim, in this movie had a way different task assigned to him playing God
user2: Alot more responsibilities also
user1: Ehh still in every movie he has been in just seems hes over acting 
user2: What did you like about bruce almighty?
user1: Morgan Freeman did great playing God
user2: I agree with that Morgan Freeman is gold in anything he acts in
user1: yes, his voice is quite soothing
user2: I liked how patient Morgan Freeman was with bruce 
user1: I don't know if I agree with Bruce using his power to bring someone else down
user1: but I guess its a movie shouldnt read too far into it lol
user2: it goes to show that even with absolute power come absolute responsibility 
user1: true
user1: can't use it just to benefit yourself
user2: Agreed my favorite part was when he made the pot appear in the news van
user1: I'm glad he finally saw Grace as being the one for him although it might not have been fair the way he treated her sometimes
user2: He was still human just granted special abilities so his human traits were still vulnerable 
user1: yes just glad he learned to be happy with her
user2: I agree, i feel that she expected alot out of him without really giving any consideration to what he was going thru 
user1: but honestly would you know how to act in that situation, you would probably think he was crazy
user2: oh no i couldnt, thats the issue its not something that a lot of people can even relate to because it cant happen to anybody in real life
user1: but what if it did? would you believe that your significant other was god if he said he was? 
user1: you would think he/she was crazy
user2: Absolutely. trust and love should be able to accept any craziness that comes your way but i do see her point  

conversation:
user2: The movie is Bruce Almightly
user2: Almighty
user2: sorry
user2: Jim Carrey plays the main charachter Bruce
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: Apparently Bruce complains to God about how God isn't doing his job right
user2: So God allows Bruce to be God for a week
user1: What genre does this movie fall under?
user2: Definitely comedy
user2: Morgan Freeman plays God
user2: Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend
user1: What happens after Bruce is allowed to be God for a week?
user2: my cheat sheet doesn't tell me that
user1: Hmm
user1: Did this movie win any awards?
user2: Rotten tomatoes gave it 48%
user2: Ah... wait now I have a second page... hold on
user2: which is blan
user2: blank
user2: haha
user2: not much info there
user2: Cinema score gave it an A
user1: Hmm, I'm not sure what other questions to ask, honestly
user2: I understand
user1: Were there crowd reviews?
user2: It came out in 2003
user1: As in not by professional critics?
user2: nope
user2: ah... wait here are some key scenes
user1: Who directed this movie?
user2: Tom Shadyac
user1: What company released this movie?
user2: Apparently Bruce uses his "powers" for evil to humiliate his competition at work
user2: It doesn't say
user1: What scene is the turning point of the movie?
user2: Then he answers all of people's prayers with a "yes" as he plays God.  
user1: Does this turn out to be a disaster?
user2: God tells him he has to deal with the prayers... and he makes everyone happy... but then everyone isn't happy because people's prayers contradict each other
user2: yea... it seems that way
user2: Kind of a putting Bruce in his place
user1: What does Bruce think about this?
user2: it doesn't really say....  I guess we get to watch the movie
user2: :D
user1: What is the movie's run time?
user2: The paper doesn't say...sorry
user1: That's okay
user1: Maybe it's time to finish the conversation
user2: very slapstick though
user2: okay... bye
user1: I've exhausted all of my possible questions, I think
user2: haha

conversation:
user2: have you seen this movie?
user1: I watched it, but I think I wasn't paying very close attention to it, actually.
user2: can you remember any funny parts? (I have no idea what to ask LOL)
user1: I recall a scene in a warehouse space, where he goes to open a filing cabinet, and it keeps going, and going, and going... like the drawer is infinitely expanding. It was kindof a cool sight gag at the time. Do you like Morgan Freeman as God?
user2: that part was funny. I think Morgan Freeman was great as God. Do you think Bruce over did it when he got the chance to be God?
user1: He was pretty rotten. But, you know, God/Reporter is not really a great pairing for jobs, IMO. That Cirtical Response though; OUCH! It might be a bad movie, but I'm not sure I think calling him not a real actor was called for. You?
user2: I think he over did his part as well. Not always a bad actor no. Do you think they should have chose someone else other than Jennifer Aniston to play Grace?
user1: Yeah. I never really saw her appeal. She seems to land a lot of kindof preachy roles, and not really a great fit for Carrey, who is so rubber-faced. Maybe they were hoping she could get her fans in the seats?
user2: Very much agreed. Do you watch many of these types of slap stick comedy movies?
user1: I seem to end up watching this sort of thing at home, but I almost never pay to see it in the theater. Nine dollars is too much to gt a chuckle. Did you see it with friends or on your own?
user1: I don't seek them out, either. They're just on, and I fail to change the channel.
user2: I watched it at home as well, with friends. How do you like Steve Carell in this movie as Evan Baxter? Was he funny to you at all? 
user1: I love Steve Carell. They tried to make him pretty unsympathetic, here. I guess you are supposed to root for the put upon reporter, who's clearly willing to cheat on his girlfirend, and has no work-life balance?
user1: The role can't have been that good, though. Can't remember a single piece of Evan/Carrel's dialogue.
user2: I love Steve Carell as well. I think they just made Bruce look bad because he was jealous of Evan's success..etc.. I kind of thought that scene was funny where Bruce made Evan say other stuff on live TV, other than his lines. Do you remember that part? What are your thoughts?
user1: Oh! Ha! Yeah, I remember that, just not the words. I do remember it being pretty cringe-worthy. But it was kindof unbelievable that a news station in a city like that would give anyone an on-air promotion. That's little-town stuff, you know? I had trouble suspending disbelief for that.
user2: I agree with that! I think the movie deserved a lower rating! It wasn't too terrible but some times Jim Carrey mocies can be too much over the top.
user1: It kindof did a disservice to women, with the "hoping for a proposal" thing. I don't know, maybe that's just me.
user1: Why do you think CinemaScore gave it an A?
user2: I can so agree with that. I have no idea about CinemaScore. I should probably look into that. Do think Bruce's email and sticky note systems were sufficient? Do you think you'd do something differently?
user2: The voices from prayers in my head would make me think I was crazy too!
user1: Yeah, there are all sort of cultivation flows an omni-benevolent, omnipotent diety might set up to automate things. Like, maybe, an importance/urgency rating? A tag system? And where are the office workers. I would assume if you're god you can magic yourself up topical angels. And didn't they kindof overlook the "all-knowing" facet of God, too? Why not ask: Would granting this prayer make things worse or better? ... And HA! Yes, if I heard voices like he was, not only would I think I was going crazy, but I would GO crazy. 
user2: Yes! I think I would be bad and use it a little bit to my advantage by making myself win the lottery instead of all those people that were praying to win the lottery.
user2: Can you imagine using those powers that Bruce did like discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body! He did it in such a bad way to earn his job back
user1: I would probably dink around with karmic rewards/punishments, myself. It would be really tough to manage in a WEEK, though, right?
user1: Bruce Nolan clearly doesn't think big enough.
user2: No he definitely doesn't. The ending somewhat ended well given the movie with Bruce and Grace getting back together. Do you find it ironic that Bruce started praying in the end?
user1: Knowing that God had very little bandwidth? Yeah. I didn't care about the couple getting back together. I think she was actually better off without. But I did appreciate the greater sense of contentment, a little? So it says he was being revived... do you remember how he came to be in need of reviving?
user1: In Buffalo NY, no one would care about a local anchor proposing on live tv. 
user2: That part I cannot remember. Yea that live proposal was a little too much and dramatic for the news! Do you remember what the sign said the "homeless man" was holding in the end?
user1: I don't actually. But it played with that idea people sometimes trot out, of what if the crazy person that says he hears god actually IS hearing god. Kindof just wanted Morgan Freeman to narrate the credits at that point. I was done.
user2: I'm trying to figure out if we covered everything. Morgan Freeman is definitely a great narrator! 
user1: Do ratings matter to you when you're choosing whether to flip the channel or not?
user2: Somewhat for me yes. I mean I'm definitely not going to watch something that rated 1 out of 5 stars
user1: Haha. Me either. But I probably am not as eager to watch the 5 star Oscar pick either.  With comedies, you are not really ever looking for stellar performances so much.
user1: And it looks like we're done! Thanks for the chat! I hope you have a great evening!
user2: Thank you!

conversation:
user2: So we gotta talk about Bruce Almighty?
user2: I thought morgan freeman as god was a nice touch
user1: YES BRUCE ALMITY

user1: JENNIFER ANISTON PLAYED GRACE HIS GIRLFRIEND

user1: BRUCE COMPLAINS TO GOD THAT HE ISNT DOING HIS JOB RIGHT
user2: yeah
user1: DID YOU KNOW THAT HE IS OFFERED IN THE MOVIE TO BE GOD HIMSELF
user2: Bruce is a little bitch isn't her
user2: I mean, tell God he's doing a bad job
user1: I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT BUT DID YOU KNOW HE IS OFFERED THE CHANCE TO BE GOD FOR ONE WEEK
user2: What's up with that
user1: ROTTEN TOMATOES GAVE IT 48 PERCENT
user2: yes, you said that
user2: God as a homeless person was pretty good too. I was homeless for a while myself
user1: BRUCE NOLAN IS A TV FIELD REPORTER FOR EYEWITNESS NEWS
user2: Are you a real person?
user1: HE IS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND GRACE CONNELLY
user1: I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT DID YOU KNOW THAT BRUCE SUFFERS FROM BAD LUCK
user2: I mean, I didn't think you were real from the first sentence
user2: I mean, why waste my time with some bot
user1: HE IS PASSED OVER FOR A PROMOTION BY HIS RIVAL
user2: I need the money though, so whatever
user2: I don't want to be homeless again
user1: STEVE CARELL STEALS HIS DIALOGUE FROM AN UNAIRED SEGMENT
user2: Did you like steve carell?
user1: STEVE CARELL ACCEPTS THE PROMOTION ON AIR 
user1: BRUCE CREATES AN EMAIL SYSTEM FOR PRAYERS AND RESPONDS TO THEM
user2: Jim carrey was only good in the one . The truman show
user1: BRUCE ALSO FINDS WAYS OF USING THE POWERS TO CAUSE MIRACULOUS EVENTS 
user2: the rest of his movies were B- to F
user2: I mean, The mask was shit, so was the Ace Ventura ones

user1: What year was the movie made?
user2: 2003
user1: What genre?

user2: There is some cursing in it but it isnt bad
user1: Have you see Evan Almight?
user1: Almighty?
user2:  I have
user2: To me it isnt as good, but to each his own
user1: Do you particularly like Jim Carrey moives?
user2: I do, he was really big when I was around the age of 12-15 and his movies made me laugh 
user1: How many times have you seen this movie?
user2: I would guess around 5 or 6
user2: How many times have you seen it.
user1: I have never seen it
user1: I am trying to decide whether to rent it or not
user2: I think it is a good movie, there are some really funny parts in it
user1: Do you know if it is on Netflix?
user2: It is not currently on the US netflix, maybe in a different country.
user1: Amazon Prime or Hulu?
user2: Not sure about those
user2: Do you have all 3 streaming platforms? amazon prime hulu and netflix?
user1: I think I have all the info that I need
user1: yes
user2: I just have amazon prime.

conversation:
user1: Hello How are you today?
user2: Great! How are you? So what do you think of Bruce Almighty?
user1: I am good. I loved the movie. Jim Carrrey and Morgan Freeman together in 1 movie is amazing
user2: Very true! I agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that's the rating I would give it! So who was your favorite character in the film?
user1: Morgan Freeman when he played GOD. His wit and such was just a prefect role for him to play in.
user1: I dont really agree with the Rotten Tomatoes score of 48%. Its considered one of Jim Carreys best movies.
user2: Agreed! I loved Freeman as God as well as Carrey as Bruce Nolan! I feel this was one of Carey's best films! 
user2: Agreed about Rotten Tomatoes. I lean more toward CinemaScore's rating! 48% is wrong in my opinion +
user1: I agree. I think this movie was when comedy was based on funny and not so much as crude as it is today.
user2: So true! Carrey was so hilarious especially in the slapstick scenes!
user1: What did think of the leading ladies?
user1: I think Jennifer Aniston plays the best girl friend. Its her querk thats makes her the best.
user2: I was really fond of Jennifer Aniston' s portrayal of Grace Connelly as his girlfriend but also liked his secret crush played by Catherine Bell who barely seemed to notice him as well! 
user2: Very true! How did you like Steve Carroll's character Evan?
user1: Evan Baxter was the  perfect protrayal  of the coworker we all love to hate. 
user2: So true! That was very wrong of him to steal dialogue from one of Bruce's unaired segments. But as you said, he was the perfect portrayal of the coworker we all love to hate!
user1: It was very wrong indeed but Evan got his just desserts in the end. 
user2: True! So what did you think of Bruce's ability to to cause miraculous events? 
user1: Almost everyone knows how it feel Bruce was passed over for a promotion. 
user1: It makes one think what would happen if we could always get what we wanted
user2: So true. It's very relatable! We all have those down on our luck moments and would love to be God for a week! Of course, I'm not sure if I could go as far as using those powers to humiliate Evan on air, causing him to get fired! Ha!
user1: I think him finding Jimmy Hoffa's body was hilarious. 
user2: Same here! Plus it earned him his job back which was a plus!
user1: I get the feeling that this moving had alone of religious undertones, not counting GOD. But alot praying for what you want and you shall receive it.
user2: Agreed. Plus Bruce's unselfish act of praying for Grace to find a better man, ultimately reconciling with Bruce. I enjoyed that scene as well. 
user1: But it makes one realize to enjoy the simple things like and not expect to get everything you every wanted. Like Bruce did after hisrecovery from being hits by a vehicle. He learned to take pleasure in simple things. 
user2: That is true. And it ultimately led to he and Gracie getting engaged  - announcing it on live television at that!
user1: "And that is How the Cookie Crumbles"  I liked the ending. it really made it pull all together
user2: I did as well... the homeless man revealing himself to be god was the perfect ending!
user1: Yes it did. Have a great day. It was very nice chatting with you.
user2: Likewise! Have a great day as well! I enjoyed chatting with you about the 2003 comedy Bruce Almighty! Take care!

conversation:
user1: Hello! What's the name of the movie?
user1: Are you here?
user2: Bruce Almighty, a comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac.
user2: It came out in 2003.
user1: Could you tell me some things about the movie? Like, the plot?
user2: Jim Carrey plays the leading role.
user2: Sure! It's a movie about a TV reporter who gets the chance to "play God" for one week.
user2: The opportunity is bestowed to him by non-other than God himself, who is played by Morgan Freeman.
user1: That does sound like an interesting and unique scenario, it is intriguing
user1: And judging by the actors, it seems that it would be something that i would watch
user1: What is the rating of the movie, though?
user2: The movie rates 5.7/10 stars on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Although the rating doesn't seem like it's too high, given the fact that it's a comedy i think i'd give it a chance
user1: do you have any more information about the movie?
user2: Oh, I forgot to tell you, the CinemaScore is an A!
user1: Have you watched the movie yourself?
user2: I think you should give it a chance, considering one critic's review I read. It stated, "Carrey is hilarious..."
user2: That is irrelevant.
user1: Although i don't like listening to critics, that quote is good to hear
user1: i think i will give it a watch judging by all the information you've given me
user2: Since you don't like critics, I definitely think you will take delight in watching Bruce Almighty. "Be your own movie critic!" That's what I always say.
user2: I hope you enjoy it however.
user2: I think you will!
user2: Do you have anymore questions for me?
user1: Thank you, i think i will too, i have never been disappointed by those actors
user1: No, i think that would be all
user2: Glad to be of assistance. Please let me know how you liked it!
user2: That way I can make better recommendations for you in the future.
user1: Thanks for all the info, it was nice talking to you
user2: Likewise. Always a pleasure.
user2: Enjoy your movie! Don't forget to pop some popcorn.
user2: I also recommend an ice cold Coca-Cola.
user2: You need to keep refreshed what with all the laughing in your near future.
user1: Haha, that alone, actually, made me laugh. Could you remind me what year was the movie released? 
user2: The year 2003. 
user1: Wow, that's actually long time ago, i'm surprised how i've never heard of the movie 'till now
user2: That was now 15 years ago! It's understandable though that you haven't heard of it, considering you're not a follower of movie reviews.
user2: Jennifer Anniston was in the movie as well.
user1: So many of my favorite actors in a movie, that's crazy
user2: Another noted actor, this has to be a good sign.
user1: Excactly

conversation:
user1: I loved this movie. What did you think?
user2: It was funny, but slightly spiritual
user1: I guess it's one of those movies that critics will pan as bad, but a casual observer will enjoy very much.
user2: What did you think of Jim Carrey's performance?
user1: Jim Carey usually thrives very well in the physical type of humor. This movie fits his style very well. What did you think of Morgan Freeman's performance?
user2: Morgan Freeman Is an exceptional actor,and the role of God, fit him perfectly
user1: What did you think of the scene when he makes the other anchor act crazy? Steve Carrell killed that scene
user2: I thought that was comedic genius!
user2: Do you think that Jim Carrey did a good job playing God?
user1: I think Jim Carey played the role well in the sense he was a human being playing God. He captured that child like elation followed by the heavy burden that must be carried. I feel he had that serious undertone that many people will question if they can do it.
user1: Did you feel Jennifer Aniston was a good role as his wife?
user2: Yes, her and Jim Carrey make an excellent team onscreen
user2: But the fact that he had feelings for his coworker kind of offsets the romance part of the movie
user1: Do you feel this movie was trying to teach a lesson?
user2: Yes, I do. God, as an all powerful being has a lot on his hands, and most people don't know the amount of work that is involved
user2: But Bruce Nolan got to experience that for himself and actually realize that it's a lot of work
user2: How was Steve Carrell's performance in the mpvie
user2: ?

conversation:
user2: Hey
user1: Hi
user1: Have you seen Bruce almighty?
user2: Do you like comedy movies?
user1: I do!
user2: Yeah, it is one of my favorite comedy movie.
user1: I enjoy it as well.
user1: The director Tom Shadyac did a godo job with it.
user2: Yes. He did an excellent job for this movie.
user1: I am surprised by the low rotten tomatoes scores.. only got 48% pretty low.
user1: I think it deserves higher.
user2: Yeah, I  agree. But most comedy movie get a low score in rotten tomato, in my opinion.
user1:  Maybe. I think Jim carrey was great as bruce the down on his luck news reporter.
user2: What is your favorite part of the movie?
user1: Well I like seeing the rivalry between carrey and carell's characters.
user1: what about you?
user2: I liked that too. My favorite part is when Bruce demonstrated his power/abilities as a god.
user1: Yes there were a lot of funny moments.
user1: I liked morgan freeman playing god.
user2: He used his power for personal use and it was really hilarious.
user1: i LIKED THE PRAYER EMAIL.
user1: opps sorry about those caps.
user2: thats fine.
user2: I think morgan freeman is not perfect for the role.
user1: I liked the part he finds jimmy hoffa's body too.
user1: totally perfect.
user2: I think a caucasian actor is perfect for the role.
user1: I disagree, I think it was great to have morgan freeman. he is in everything and feels a bit of a comment on that.I can't believe it came out in 2003, seems so long ago.
user2: Yeah, that was so long ago. What can you say about the director?
user1: Not much I am not sure what else he has done.
user2: I think the Tom Shadyac did a great job for directing this movie.
user1: I agree with you on that.
user1: Very highconcept comedy film and enjoyable.
user2: I love the effects they have on this movie.
user1: I enjoyed them as well.
user1: I also thought jeniffer aniston was good as grace.
user2: Yeah, she was a great actress.
user1: was..?
user2: how many times you watched this movie/
user1: A bunch.
user2: really?...like how many times?
user1: It comes on tv a lot and will always watch a little when I see it.

user2: Hello
user1: Hello! Today we will talk about the Movie "Bruce Almighty" starring Jim Carrey
user2: Okay Brunce almighty
user2: I'm a big Jim Carrey fan
user2: Did you see the movie?
user1: yes. did you?
user2: No not yet, all of my friends talk about it from time to time though. They say it's really funny
user1: Yes. do you enjoy comedy movies?
user2: Actually, I only really watch comedy so it's a wonder I missed this one
user2: when was it released? 
user1: It was released in 2003.
user2: Jesus. Thats an old one...what's it about? 
user1: Well it's about a down-on-his-luck Tv reporter played by Jim Carrey who complains to God for not doing his job. So he gives Jim Carrey the job of being God for a week.
user1: It's pretty funny, especially an iconic scene with  Steve Carrel 
user2: Actually I think I've seen clips from the movie on youtube 
user2: but I've never seen the full thing
user2: What's your favorite part of the movie?
user1: My favorite scene is when Jim Carrey blows up during an interview he is doing at the Niagra Falls 
user1: Although people gave it a good review, it was poorly received with critics... 
user2: I think maybe because critics are too critical haha
user2: people forget to enjoy the movie
user2: this one sounds like it would be easy watching
user2: well it sounds interesting
user2: I want to watch it
user2: Is there anything else you think I should know about the movie? 
user1: A key fact is that God is played by Morgan Freeman 
user2: oh really?!
user2: You didn't say that before! 
user2: I am a huge Morgan Freeman fan!
user1: I should have mentioned that... Also that not all critics were harsh, CinemaScore gave it a solid A.
user2: If I were talking to God, I imagine he would sound exactly like Morgan Freeman
user2: I've only seen Rottentomatos reviews. I'll have to check out CinemaScore. Do they revivew as often as rotten tomatoes?
user1: I am not sure... Maybe not as much.
user1: Also Tom Shadyac directed the movie
user1: Have you seen any of his other movies?
user2: Well I saw "The Nutty Professor" as well as "Ace Ventura"
user2: He seems to enjoy working with Jim Carey pretty frequently
user1: Well I would not blame him for that
user2: Indeed
user2: Jim Carrey is a funny guy. I love his movies!
user2: So in your opinion 
user2: why did you think it was funny despite the critics reviews?
user1: Well I enjoyed it being original, it has a great cast: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston. There are funny scenes as the one where Jim is God and he has to respond to everybody's prayers in the form of an email
user1: So he automatically replies yes to everybody so everybody's prayers are answered but that's not always a good thing
user2: Hmm I agree
user2: and I can see why you enjoyed it
user2: I definitely dont see many movies along this sort of theme so
user2: I will definitely check it out in the future! 
user2: Thanks!

user2: i know some of the scenes but I’m not sure
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: Well, let's go off the provided documents. I have seen it
user2: Okay, did you like it?
user1: Overall, yes. Morgan Freeman as God is always a good choice
user2: Oh, so that’s the movie where he’s God.
user2: Okay, yeah. That’s a good movie.
user2: Did you see the rating it got on Rotten Tomatoes thoughc
user2: ?
user1: 48%, which I get. comedies tend to not fare well on that site, and it's not as though the premise of the movie is anything revolutionary
user2: I know, but still, kind of an understatement 
user1: lol, what do you mean?
user2: Only Cinema Score gave it a an A
user2: I mean, it’s a great movie and it should be rated as such.
user2: Most critics don’t often agree with the public’s general opinion.
user1: meh. depends on the criteria we're judging it by. there are big names in it, who are good actors, and the concept is interesting, but ultimately I would say it's not a life changing movie
user1: which is what I would need for an A rating
user2: Lately there’s been lots of bad movies getting great criticism.
user1: the auto-yes email answer scene is good though
user1: such as
user1: ?
user2: Comedies and horror movies often get the short end of the stick.
user1: why do you think that is?
user2: The shape of water, meh film with some nice visuals
user2: Horror movies and comedies are expected to be great and perfect stories, but they can’t be due to the laugh or scare factor they must possess.
user1: in what ways are they expected to be "great and perfect stories"? by the "laugh or scare factor" do you just mean like... jump scares, conflict, or situational irony?
user2: Yes, that’s what I mean
user2: Storytelling is the only factor they take into account and not the conditions of the genre.
user1: well... for any story to work, there needs to be conflict, or else we're just... watching randomly-selected events
user2: Right yeah
user2: Let’s get back to Bruce Allmighty
user2: Do you think this is a typical movie for Jim Carrey?
user1: definitely. it's a comedy, which is what he's well-known for, and the character is the same sort of self-pitying middle-class dude he tends to embody
user2: Great chat. Bye!
user1: but there's an underlying ~message~ about God and free will and such

conversation:
user2: What do you think about Jim Carrey as Bruce?
user1: I think he played the role really well, and was quite funny.
user2: Yea I thought the bruce character was pretty funny when he was complaining to God
user1: Morgan Freeman is the perfect person to play God.
user2: Yes he has just the right voice and persona to pull it off don't you agree?
user1: Yeah, definitely. I don't know why so many of the ratings of the movie were kind of mediocre.
user2: The ratings were a bit unfair, it's an underrated movie for sure.
user1: I didn't remember that Jennifer Aniston was in Bruce Almighty.
user2: I don't remember seeing her either
user2: Was she really in it? Wait was she the girlfriend?
user2: I think his girlfriend was Grace
user1: I have no idea actually, I would have to rewatch it. It's been a long time since it came out, I can't even remember when I last saw it.
user2: Did you like Jim Carrey in the news reporter role?
user1: Oh I guess you're right about Bruce's girlfriend being Grace. 
user1: I did like him as a news reporter.
user2: It was a good fit for him I think. 
user2: Did you laugh when he got turned down for the promotion?
user1: He plays almost all his roles really well, even if the movie itself isn't great. It seems like that was a reoccurring criticism of his movies: that his acting was good but the movies themselves weren't always equal to the amount of comedic effort he put in.
user1: I felt bad for his character honestly when he got turned down.
user2: I agree with that he is pretty good even when using a relatively silly storyline like this movie. He was very believable in this role and did a great job
user2: Did you like how he took to the role of being God?
user2: I thought it was funny what he tried to do with the emails.
user1: It was humorous, but I almost felt sympathy for all the characters around him who were being negatively affected by his random decisions that he made, as God, for his own benefit.
user1: Do you think Evan should have been fired just because Bruce wanted his job?
user2: I still thought those parts were pretty funny even though they were a bit tortured. I was amused by that also. 
user2: Which girl do you think was a better fit for him?
user1: If Bruce ended up loving Grace enough to marry her, and God decided he was the man who would make her most happy, then I think they belonged together.
user1: I like how Bruce ends up ultimately enjoying his job as a reporter more, and appreciating the things that he has instead of envying others
user2: I think so too, plus I like the actress better
user2: Yes it had a good message in that way, that was a nice touch. It was pretty believable for such a silly plot.
user1: Exactly, a heartwarming ending is always nice. You like Jennifer Aniston better than Catherine Bell?
user2: Yes I like Jennifer Aniston a lot better what about you?
user1: I don't really know, actually. I never really thought about it. What do you think of the director, Tom Shadyac?
user2: I don't really have an opinion of him but he did a good job I would have to say. 
user1: Same here. Bruce Almighty is such an iconic movie.
user2: It is a pretty one of kind movie in a lot of ways.
user2: What was your favorite part?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user1: Yes, the metacritic score was 46/100 out of 100,  i'm not sure what that means
user2: Not real high. It's a funny, rather corney movie.
user2: Jim Carrey overacts but there are some good laughs.
user2: Although I do LOVE Morgan Freeman in most anything he does. 
user1: You said it got 81 on rotten tomatoes,  mine says 48

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: How's it goin?
user1: Pretty good, how about you?
user2: Same same. They give us 5 minutes to read that whole page.. 
user1: Yeah I just took a look over it, wow, that movie is 15 years old now.
user2: For real. And it really only got 48% on Rotten Tomatoes. 
user1: I bet the rating for it back in early 2000’s it was higher.
user2: Jim Carrey deserves better.
user1: Yeah, he is a good actor!
user2: Steve Carell is in it too. I just realized that a few months ago.
user2: Oh woh, it changed
user1: I must of forgotten Jennifer Aniston was in it 
user2: What'd you do if you were God for a week.
user1: Oh gosh, I don’t even know... to be a fly on some peoples walls. 
user2: Or all the people at once- eh
user1: Be little overwhelming to have that power or abilities
user2: I'd be down to see the future. Maybe give myself permanent photographic memory or something nice.
user1: Course Jim Carrey abuses the power 
user1: Gives everything they ask for. 
user2: Does it count as abusing power if he makes all the rules? 
user1: Guess that is true. Good point
user1: He uses it a bit selfish like I suppose
user2: Mm true, I guess if I had all that power then I'd  end up not wanting or needing anything since it would always be within reach. 
user2: In the movie he doesn't really fix anything though, it's just a story about his journey and growth I guess.
user1: Well the ending of that movie wasn’t very dramatic. 
user1: Seems he was just taking what he had for granted?
user2: It's almost as if they made it a metaphor on purpose...
user1: Right! Now I’m kind of like is 48% rating correct? Lol
user2: Or maybe Jim is really just hearing voices and going crazy.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: The movie bruce almighty is the best
user1: you should watch it
user1: It stars jim carrey as bruce nolan
user2: who is in it?
user1: Morgan freeman the god of everything plays god
user1: Jennifer aniston is in it too
user2: who directed it?
user1: Tom Shadyac
user1: It got a 48% on rotten tomatoes
user2: who is the love interest?
user1: The love interest is Grace Connelly
user1: It came out in 2003
user2: is 48 a good score on rotten tomatoes?
user1: 48 out of 100
user1: so not so good
user1: but it got an A on cinemascore
user1: So i guess it just depends on personal taste
user2: what is it about?
user1: This guy Bruce that complains to god about not being good at his job and then he is allowed to be god for a week.
user1: It's one of Jim Carrey's best films.
user2: who was the cinematographer?
user1: It doesn't say, but theres a funny scene where he loses his shit on live tv
user2: what happens when he loses his shit?
user1: His partner gets a promotion over him then steals his lines on tv so he essentially goes crazy. lol
user2: awesome. Jim is funny. Who wrote the screenplay?
user1: It doesn't say but he uses his god powers to make funny stuff happen. Like parting the red sea of soup. In his soup bowl.
user1: .
user2: who was the cinematographer?
user1: The document doesn't say. But in one scene he pulls the moon closer for his love interest. and he makes ducks fly in the formation of  a heart.
user2: i kind of want to see it, but not sure. Did it win any awards?
user1: Unfortunately not it just has mixed reviews on rating sites. But if you're a fan of Jim Carrey you'll love it.
user2: what year did it come out?
user1: It came out in 2003
user1: Carrey is one of the best comedy actors
user2: do you know who wrote the music?
user1: I did not know that actually
user1: pretty cool
user2: out of 5 stars, how many would you give it?

conversation:
user1: Hi there!
user1: So what's the name of the movie that you read about?
user2: Hello, have you ever seen the movie Bruce Almighty? I highly recommend it.
user1: No, I haven't seen it yet.
user1: What is it about?
user2: The movie is a comedy starting Jim Carrey. This hilarious character plays Bruce Nolan a reporter who gets the chance to be "god" himself (played by Morgan Freeman).
user1: Ooo I like Jim Carrey movies. When did this come out?
user2: The movie scored 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and came out in 2003. Supporting actors include Jennifer Aniston. 
user1: Ah the early 2000's was a good time for comedy movies. But man, it only scored 48% on Rotten Tomatoes?
user1: That's kind of disappointing....
user2: I agree, but the CinemaScore was an A
user1: That's good to hear. Are there any other movies that are similar to Bruce Almighty?
user2: The plot line of playing "god" for a week is only in this movie. No other ones like it that I am aware of.
user1: Ah got it. Is there a sequel to this movie?
user2: No current sequel to this film.
user1: Wait so Morgan Freeman plays God? That's so funny. Does he have the full on white robe with a full white beard and booming voice?

conversation:
user1: Morgan Freeman is a great actor to play the role of God.
user2: Yes he was
user2: But Bruce played a perfect role about a how human thinks about god
user2: Most important thing i saw is that the prayer has to be made in the correct so that god can answer
user1: Man having the chance to be God for a week is an eye-opener... it shows how difficult the role actually is
user1: I agree... prayer does have to be made in the correct way
user2: yes 
user2: we are only a creation and we cannot imagine how a creator works
user1: agreed
user2: that is beyond comprehension
user1: i never realized how low of a rating this movie received from movie critics overall.
user2: the movie shows how  a desire and lust , all these things can make you a slave of this world
user2: yes that is poor 
user2: the movie was funny, entertaining and with proper theme
user1: It just hit me that Steve Carell was in this movie... I guess when I saw it in 2003 it didn't stand out to me. I have only seen it once.
user2: i saw this about 3-4 times 
user1: Very funny movie. Also has a great cast! 
user2: one of the hillarious things happened when he was presenting a news and bruce made some sentences for him to read
user2: I was rolling on the floor
user2: yeah every character was nice 
user1: The movie has more substance to it than a lot of comedy movies today... it actually has a good meaning to the base of the story, its not just about the laughs
user2: humour can send you a lot of messages and perhaps through laughter you can send some powerful messages across the world 
user2: i agree
user1: Yes, I agree.
user1: It also shows us how unanswered prayers or getting a "no" to our prayers is sometimes for the best even though we don't realize it. Albeit, in a comedic way.
user1: This is probably one of my fave roles jim carrey has played
user2: Sometimes we don't see the whole picture of our life because we do not have the knowledge about the future and we start complaining about the things that why our prayers not getting answered
user2: but there is a wisdom behind it and just like the picture shows that every prayer cannot have yes otherwise the problems will be there
user2: which was fact for me in this movie
user1: yes, i agree
user2: yes agreed
user2: The character of Morgan Freeman was nice and deep
user2: it was so relaxed of him 
user1: It was. I love Morgan Freeman's voice... that is what made him perfect in the role for me.
user1: Also I liked that Bruce and Grace ended up together at the end of the movie.
user2: yeah there is always a happy ending in our life
user1: I liked that his prayer for Grace to find someone to make her happy ended up being him.
user2: that makes you feel good about it
user1: yes, for the most part I agree
user2: absolutely
user2: the choice of name was perfect for the movie
user2: Grace
user1: Yes, it was. Lots of hidden meanings all throughout the movie
user2: The one thing I learned that you have to surrender your will to god 
user2: and thats how you are going to find true happiness
user2: a job will not make you happy
user2: or any other worldly things if you are not surrendering your will to god
user1: I agree. We don't know enough about what is actually going on the be able to control our lives. To truly be happy we have to surrender to God and allow him to guide us and direct us. Otherwise our lives will be chaos and we will always be searching for something that we can never find.
user2: exactly 
user2: so the things that we should be asking God is not the job i want , want the house that i want , etc. it is the guidance that we should be asking to him and the movie shows  a glimpse of it 
user2: especially bruce makes it clear at the end by taking the job that he did not wanted.
user2: The movie showed about the how the prayers are made at the end not for yourself but how to ask good about your loved ones and other people
user2: Susan Ortega was a nice character to show how a man can go for his lust 
user1: And even though he didn't want that job, now he realized he was meant to have it and took more pleasure in it. Sometimes it us that preventing us from enjoying something or getting along with someone,etc. We need to change ourselves and our attitudes and then the way we see things change... it isn't always the surroundings or the circumstances that need to change. 
user1: I agree she was
user2: agreed
user2: The movie should not have got this low rating 
user2: even today it would have been a higher rating 
user1: I think that it was a great movie but sadly I don't think the rating would be much higher because it is becoming more and more taboo to talk about God let alone a movie be all about him
user2: yeah but and 6.5-7  would have been good
user2: but because of the comdey genre, i think it got less
user1: that is true. typically it seems that only the "oscar worthy" movies get good ratings from critics
user2: agreed
user2: ok it was great talking with you about the movie
user1: it was great talking to you also

conversation:
user2: Have I got a movie suggestion for you!
user1: Hello
user2: Have you ever seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: Yes
user1: That movie was really funny
user2: Great, then you know all about the slapstick scenes. Which was your favorite scene? 
user1: Where the monkey crawl out of the guy 
user1: What was yours?
user2: That's a pretty good one. Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle. I do agree with the monkey scenes. Do you remember the job and name of Jim Carrey's character in the film?
user1: He was a news reporter. The character name was Bruce  Nolen
user2: Nice! I read a summary that In one of Jim Carrey's best films he place Bruce Nolan, a news reporter that nurses the hopes of one day becoming an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor. What are your thoughts on that? Do you feel it is accurate?
user1: I think it is accurate because in order to succeed sometimes you can't always be nice. 
user2: I agree. I was really surprised to see that the film only received a 48% on rotten tomatoes.
user1: Yes. Not all people like it. 
user1: Are we done here?
user1: You still there?
user1: ???
user1: Thanks
user2: Sorry!

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hi! I hear we get to discuss a movie today.
user2: Yup!
user2: Its bruce almighty
user2: With one of my favorite charactors jim carrey
user1: I am not familiar with that film, although I have heard of it.
user2: Its a good one
user1: I do like Jim Carey movies. 
user1: What is it about?
user2: Jim plays a news worker and wants to become an anchorman 
user1: It sounds like it would be funny.
user2: He is frustrated and tells God he can do Godding better than him so God (Morgan Freeman) lets him be God
user1: So is it a comedy or serious?
user2: Its a classic
user2: Comedy
user2: Jennifer anniston is in it as well
user1: I may have to see if it is on Netflix.
user2: I think it might be
user1: I love Jennifer Anniston.
user2: i saw it not long ago on there
user2: Same
user2: She doesnt age
user1: That is good to know. 
user1: It is appropriate for kids?
user2: I would say  so
user2: steve correll is in it too
user1: The cast is great, it seems like a fun family film.
user2: It is! 
user2: The rating were tough on it though
user2: ratings*
user1: I can't believe I haven't seen it before.
user1: Jennifer Aniston films never seem to do that well.
user1: Do you know how long ago it came out in theaters?
user2: Im suprised by that
user2: she is simply wonderful
user2: umm
user2: 2003
user1: I agree. I like romantic comedies and she does them well.
user2: marley and me too :)
user1: Yes, I did see that one. Sad.
user1: Jim Carey films are good although a little of him goes a long way.
user2: He is a charactor
user1: True.
user2: he made me giggle my whole childhood
user2: I dont care what he does, he could kill people or something, i would still love him
user1: I was an adult when he came on the scene. I wasn't sure what to make of him.
user1: Where does the film take place?
user2: Aduilt during ace ventura?
user2: IM not sure its a major city
user1: What year was Ace?
user2: 94
user1: Oh yes, adult. 
user1:  I think we can finish this now!
user2: aw man
user2: asce ventura was the best kid movie in my eyes
user2: yay!
user2: have a good day!

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: got any movie suggestions?
user1: hello
user1: I do happen to have a great one :)
user1: I'd like to recommend Bruce Almighty
user2: i will take your recommendation because i have seen the movie and love jim carry my kid have never seen.
user2: It's been a while though would you be interested in telling me a bit about it?
user1: yes it stars Jim Carrey whom I love along with Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston
user1: it's about a reporter that's having a bad time and complains to God so he gets to play God for a week
user2: morgan freeman is one of my absolute favorite actors along with jim carre. Jennifer aniston is a great actor as well. The years have been kind to her.. 
user1: I love all three of the main actors and actresses too
user2: Didn't they make a sequel to bruce almighty?
user1: do you happen to know why the Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores would be so low? They're 48 percent and 46/100 respectively
user2: wow no i wouldn't
user2: i remember all the good critique from the 90s about it i don't know why they would give such a low rating
user1: Evan Baxter is the rival who gets the promotion that causes the breaking point for Jim Carrey's character in the movie
user2: Ah yea that's steve carrell huh?
user1: yes it's Steve Carrell whom I also love...don't know which one I like more between him and Jim Carrey
user1: what do you think about Bruce's use of God-like powers in the movie?
user2: exactly the type of things i'd be doing lol. Jim and steve both did really well bringing out the main characters personality
user2: they both are those kind of slapstick comiedians
user1: one of the reviews actually said "Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes"
user2: haha that's awesome. Who directed?
user1: some of the funny use of powers were when he causes Evan to embarrass himself on the air which gets him fired though 
user2: haha yep
user1: I've never heard of the director but his name is Tom Shadyac
user2: i may have to look up some of his other works. I've never heard of him either
user1: the ending of the movie is a pretty nice wrap up for the movie 
user1: I think the director did a nice job with that
user2: I can't recall how it ends
user1: Jim Carrey is in the hospital and says a prayer for Jennifer Aniston to find the man she loves and then he gets miraculously healed and starts loving his job, his wife, and his life more

conversation:
user1: What did you think of the acting?
user2: Absolutely blasphemous. Jim Carrey is a fool.
user2: Which is what made it so hilarious at times. Who doesn't love watching a good trainwreck of a movie?
user1: He tends to play silly roles but I think he is a good choice for them. He's very expressive, more so than other actors.
user1: Do you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes rating? 48% is pretty low.
user2: On their scale, yeah. Same with the average IMDb rating. I'd consider it about on par with movies of a similar score on each website.
user2: How old were you when it came out?
user1: I personally would give it a Fresh but I'm no trained critic. 
user1: I was like 14 when I first saw it but I just watched it again recently and got a lot more of the jokes.
user1: I think Morgan Freeman did a excellent job and was a good casting. However I can't say the same for some of the other actors.
user2: lol I remember seeing it on TV a few years back. The only distinct parts I remember are that Morgan Freeman was awkward as all hell and Jim Carrey just did his Jim Carrey thing, acting like a caricature of a character that was already outlandish.
user2: and then they had a sequel, right?
user2: Evan Almighty
user2: or was it Kevin
user1: I'm not sure. That's possible but I don't think I ever saw it. Was there any specific scenes that made you dislike the movie?
user2: Like I said, I can't remember much at all. I remember a few bits with Jennifer Aniston that stuck in my head just because she's hot, but I mostly just remember being bored. To me, there are movies that I can't enjoy without unless I nitpick at all their flaws.
user2: Regardless of anyone's opinion though, it was definitely a success. It's hard to believe it's been 15 years since it was released.
user1: Oh, do you generally not watch "badly" rated movies? 
user1: The fact that it's memorable enough to still be popular today is impressive. 
user2: I'm more of a literature person. I like movies that have artistic goals more in line with that of a serious writer, not of someone paid to churn out scripts.
user2: In other words, I'm pretentious ya know
user1: Lol, I can understand that. You have to admit the email system for prayers was pretty clever?
user1: Way to bring a modern twist into the story.
user2: Perhaps it had deeper motives of showing how technology brings us closer every day to things that people once thought only possible by God
user1: I never thought of it that way, interesting. The auto-"yes" program he ends up using also reflects the view that people will be happy if they get what they want. He thinks he's doing good but does not think about the consequences.
user2: hah yes, that is clever. Maybe it warrants a rewatch.
user2: here I am talking about the movie with only my vague memory of it... I didn't even notice the whole synopsis in the document
user2: I think the whole thing trivializes religion a bit too much
user1: The reveal that Bruce is the man that would make Grace happy is a nice ending. I didn't like the sub-plot with him being flirty with his co-worker. As wholesome as the ending is, the movie was a big raunchy especially for a movie that has religion in it. 
user1: Do you think the lack of respect for God made people give it a lower rating?
user2: Definitely. My parents, who are devout protestants, trash-talked this movie when they first heard of it.
user2: but my problem with it is that Christianity already suffers from so much dilution of doctrine that  trivialization in pop culture only serves to make people more comfortable with the modern state of Christianity, a shell of what it used to be.
user1: I can see how that could turn some people away. The homeless man being God is a good message though. Reminiscent of Jesus, who cared for the poor. Really mixed messages though. It tries to be both a comedy and a "deep" movie. 
user2: yeah, it regurgitates some themes from the Bible in a modern movie, and they knew that alone would make money. 
user2: phew, talking about religion makes me sweat. let's finish this one.

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1:  I'm good and you?  Today we'll be discussing Bruce Almighty.
user1: It's a comedy with Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Aniston.
user2: Oh awesome, I've never seen that film before, always wanted to.
user2: I love Jim Carrey. What's his role?
user1: Jim Carrey, places Bruce Nolan, who is kind of your typical everyday guy, who's down on his luck and complains to God (Morgan Freeman).
user2: Haha, so Morgan Freeman plays God? I'm sure this movie is hilarious then!
user1: Yeah, the reviews weren't the greatest.  One says Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but the movie gets bogged down in the treacle.
user2: Well jeez, that reviewer must not have enjoyed the film using a word like "treacle"!
user2: What role does Jen Anniston play?
user1: It doesn't really say, just says her characters name is Gracey Connelly.
user1: Oh, there it is, she plays Bruce's(Jim Carrey's character) girlfriend.
user2: Oh, very nice, I like her in comedy movies so I'm sure she's great. 
user2: What's the plot of the movie?
user1: Steve Carrell is in it as well, and that's the Bruce's breaking point.  Bruce plays a newsreporter aspiring to become a new anchor, and hits his breaking point when he gets passed over for the job by rival reporter Steve Carrell (who plays Evan Baxter.
user2: Sounds funny! Always good to have rivalry in comedy, especially with those two actors cause they are both hysterical in their own right.
user2: Did you have any favorite moments from the film?
user1: I think the whole movie is pretty good
user1: After complaining to God, God gives Bruce all the powers of being God.
user2: Whoa haha, seems like a risky move with Jim Carey at the helm!
user1: Yeah he then makes all sorts of miracles happen, and humiliates Steve Carrell's character.
user2: As to be expected, I guess. I would mess with Steve Carrell in that position as well!
user2: Is it all comedic, or is their drama involved as well?
user1: But he eventually hears voices in his head, and finds out they are all people praying to him and becomes overwhelmed.
user1: So I'd say theres a bit of drama.
user2: Oh wow, yeah, that does seem overwhelming.. Never thought about it like that, almost kinda sad.
user1: After that fiasco the real God (Morgan Freeman) returns, and tells Bruce to pray for what he really wants.
user1: After that he prays for his characters girlfriend to find a man that would make her happy, which in the end, ends up being Bruce.
user2: Hmm, interesting, nice way to spin the film. So it's got a bit of romantic drama in it as well. I like that. 
user1: Yeah, a little bit I suppose
user2: That's nice. I like movies that spread across dramas a bit, especially comedies. 
user2: Seems like a fun film though!
user2: Thanks for sharing info about the film, I'll be sure to check it out
user1: Good deal, and have a great day :)

conversation:
user1: Hello

user1: its the little things that he uses the powers for that make it funny
user2: I totally disagree wth the bad reviews!
user1: i havent read any of them but i would assume that i would as well as i dont know how anyone could hate the movie haah
user2: Rotten tomato soup only gave it a 5.7/10
user1: omg how!
user1: they must not like it do to the god complex
user2: Yeah, maybe it wasn’t as technically good but it was sooo hilarious 
user2: Did you see in in theaters?
user1: no i dont believe so i think i saw it first on dvd
user2: I saw it in theatres, was kind of fun! 
user1: how old is the movie again?

user2: Haha agreed! 

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hey have you ever heard of the movie Bruce Almighty?
user2: It is a great comedy staring Jim Carrey.
user1: I feel like I know the name and I know I know Carrey, but do not think I have seen the movie
user2: It is a good movie. Morgan Freeman is in it. He plays god. He tells Jim Carrey that he gets to be god for awhile.
user1: So since Carrey is in it, does that mean it is a comedy?
user2: It got average scores. It got a 57/100 on average.
user2: Yes it is a comedy with some funny scenes.
user1: Figured it was a comedy, but am surprised by the low scores.
user2: Yes this was suprising.
user2: CinemaScore gave it an A though.
user1: So are there any other big name actors in the cast?
user2: Jennifer Anniston plays Jim Carrey's girlfriend.
user2: It takes place in Buffalo New York.
user1: She usually acts very well so that is a bonus. 
user2: Yes she is good.
user2: Steve Carrell also is in it. He plays Jim's rival.
user1: So do you know why he becomes god in the movie?
user2: Because he hates his life and wants to kill himself basically.
user2: He is sick of getting screwed over and loses a promotion to Steve.
user1: Well that is a dark start for a comedy lol but makes sense for the plot
user2: He eventually uses his powers to get Steve fired.
user1: Does he use it for any good, or is it just for funny moments
user2: It turns out he also had to take prayers so he automatically answers yes to every prayer.
user2: A little bit of both.
user1: Does he do anything for himself or girlfriend
user2: Yeah he takes her to a fancy dinner at one point.
user1: oh was expecting something funny lol
user2: Yeah he and his girlfriend were having issues but they make up in the end.
user2: He tried to use his powers to find her another man but they ended up just geting back together.
user1: happy endings are always good. So you would recommend? 
user2: I would check it out it is not bad.
user1: Seems like a good movie. I like the cast alot so may be worth a shot
user2: That would be the smart thing to do.
user1: Do you know who directed it?
user2: Tom Shadyac

conversation:
user1: Morgan freeman as god is a funny twist.
user2: yes. i really like the one scene where he said i met you on the 7 at 7 not expecting it to happend 
user1: What is treacle?
user2: its some sort of tart ithat is uncrystallised syrup made during the refining of sugar. 
user1: ah. thank you.
user1: jennifer aniston is so hot in this movie
user2: i also like the scene where jennifer aniston was running and she saw the trees saying please forgive him
user1: Jim carrey is usually a down on his luck type of character. 
user2: yes, he usually is. also sting pretty crazy
user1: It calls it one of his best films and yet says it has low scores on the critic sites. ironic.
user2: yes. but usually there always lower than the people score
user1: hmmm my second page did not load
user2: it was a pretty funny movie when it came out. one of the funniest scenes that i remember was with the monkey
user1: haha yes!               are you able to scroll to your second page.
user2: yes. its just blank just white page
user1: ah same here.
user1: broken content?
user2: i dint think. its just white page. also when the old guy in the restaurant was freakin out when he was separating tthe soup
user2: the second page got reloaded its working now. weird 
user1: ah. its adding more material to the same movie. like the email scene "you got prayer."
user2: i think so. yes
user1: i like when he lassos the moon
user2: yup. and adding starts
user1: yes, the stars he ads by poking at the sky.
user2: yup ;0
user1: cool... it added the hospital scene.
user2: i think that was pretty much everything i liked about the movie
user1: yeah, it felt kinda forced. would be funny if this were a turing test
user2: yes. it would be. 
user2: or just to see how long can you go without getting mad 
user1: haha. i'm actually trying to count how often it adds material.
user1: oh we can finish now

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello!
user2: What is the name of the movie you just read about? 
user1: Bruce Almighty
user2: Oh, i've wanted to watch that movie for a while. I've never seen it. Was there anything you found interesting about the movie while reading about it?
user1: Well, for starters, it has Morgan Freeman in it. He's a really great actor. But the plot sounds very interesting, a man is having bad luck. He is a TV reporter, and he begins complaining to God. He then gets to see what it's like to be God for a week.
user2: I often complain to God about things but never consider what it would be like to be on the receiving end of those complaints lol. I've heard lots of jokes about the movie, it seemed to be very popular when it came out. I do love Jim Carrey so much too, he is also in it right? And Morgan Freeman plays God?
user1: Yes, that's correct! The film also has Jennifer Aniston. All wonderful actors.
user2: Do you have any idea when the movie was released, or how long the movie is? I'm not sure how much information the document you read had in it. But I've been told to gather information, so that's what i'm gonna try to do :D
user1: I know it was released in 2003, but I'm not sure how long it is. It was directed by Tom Shadyac, and it has okay-reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave it  48%, and it received an "A" by CinemaScore
user2: Oh, I think that's the same guy who directed Ace Ventura. One of my favorite comedies from the 90's! 
user1: He's in a relationship with his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), but he has a crush on a co-worker. He's a field-reporter, but he wants to be a news anchorman. 
user2: Boy, he sounds like a real winner. 
user1: Lol, right! I guess it's a comedy but it sounds sad due to his bad luck. His rival at his job receives the promotion that he wants.
user2: That sounds like a good recipe for some heart warming comedy that might leave me saying, "Hmm, I've learned so much about life from this movie and suddenly feel compelled to change my attitude." lol. I feel like Jim Carrey often chooses movies that leave you feeling that way. 
user1: Yeah!! Critics say it's one of Carrey's best films!
user2: Oooooh. Well, this sounds very compelling to me. 

conversation:
user2: ello
user1: hello
user2: Bruce allmighty-- allrighty then
user1: how did you like the movie?
user2: hallarious with a good mesage, you?
user1: Jim Carrey did a great job. Not his best work, but very funny
user2: i agree
user2: critics were a bit harsh
user2: I thought morgan freeman was a great choice for his rol
user1: What did you think of Jennifer Anniston?
user1: I think she was a good supporting role 
user2: she is always awesome in my oppinion
user2: I havent sceen it since the year it came out so i dont remember a lot
user1: It looks like CinemaScore was totally not on the same page as the other critics rating wise. I wonder why? I've never even heard of them honestly 
user2: im not very familiar with the writers or director either
user2: i am also a fan of carell
user1: I am too, I am a big fan of his work in other films and tv shows
user2: do you know much about the director or writers?
user1: Not at all, I have never even heard of them. Have you?
user2: nope
user1: Do you remember the part when Bruce makes Evan spew out complete nonsense when he is on air?
user1: That is one of my favorite parts. I don't remember the movie that much either but I thought that part was so funny
user2: yes now that you mention it
user1: I wish I could remember the ending of it
user2: yes it is vauge, i guess it ended with him learning a lesson about existance and perfection
user2: well there it is in the latest paper
user2: "document"
user1: Yeah I was just reading that haha
user1: So I guess he kind of finds out what was going on 
user1: Would you watch it again? I probably wouldn't 
user2: yes
user2: i cind of want to rewatch the highlights and ending now but dont know how high it would be on my "list"
user2: I think we only have a bit more to go
user1: I agree. I would do that, or put it on the television as background noise 
user1: I am still here haha 
user1: It did turn me on to Evan Almighty
user1: I liked that one a lot more
user2: I hear ya, guess were done now, have a good day.
user1: you too! 

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you seen this movie?
user2: hi, i haven't seen this movie. Was it good?
user1: I don't think I have seen this one either.
user1: I like Morgan Freeman more than I do Jim Carey.
user1: I wonder where they came up with the description 'American High-Concept comedy film.'
user2: I like Morgan Freeman too. Is he in the new movie 
user1: He is in Bruce Almighty. He plays the part of God. 
user2: And Jim Carey is Bruce?
user1: It would be fun to be God for a day though. At least I think it would. 
user1: I like Jennifer Aniston too. 
user1: Yes
user2: I don't know if I would like to Play God that's a big responsibility
user1: True. 
user2: Is Jennifer Aniston his girlfriend in the movie
user1: I am not sure. I would think so. 
user2: I think I would like to see this movie 
user1: I think I would too. Not sure I would pay to see it though.
user1: It is an interesting plot 
user2: I would pay to see it for $1
user1: haha, I guess I could give up a dollar for it. 
user1: I didn't realize it came out so long ago.
user2: How long ago was it?
user2: 10 years
user1: 2003, 15 years ago.
user2: wow! time flies
user1: Yea, I feel old now
user1: haha
user2: lol. me too 
user2: comedies are timeless 
user2: comedy is my favorite genre
user1: I like comedies too
user2: I think we like the same movies lol 
user1: It looks like Jennifer Aniston is Jim Carey's girlfriend in the movie
user1: I like comedies, I'm just not a Jim Carey fan.
user2: JIm Carey is weird
user1: I agree
user1: But with Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston in the movie, I can tolerate Carey. 
user2: i think i will watch it 
user1: The movie's score isn't that great. 
user2: then again maybe not 
user1: I've never heard of Phillip Baker Hall

conversation:
user1: Hey lets talk about this movie
user1: whats the name of it?
user2: Hello, have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: nope
user1: whats it about
user2: It's a comedy about a reporter who is down on his luck and is offered the chance to become God to see how hard God has it in life. 
user1: Does it have good reviews?
user1: and who are the main actors
user2: It has a CinemaScore of an "A" and is a funny movie. It stars Jim Cary as the reporter and Morgan Freeman as God. It has 
user1: Sounds like it could be a good comedy.  How long is the movie? 
user1: Also from what Year?
user2: It came out in 2003, but I am not sure how long it is.
user1: do you have the imdb rating?
user1: or the rotten tomatoes rating?
user2: I do not have an IMDB rating but the Rotten Tomatoes average is 5.7/10
user1: oh thats low
user1: have you seen it?
user1: and do you recommend it?
user2: I have see it. A looong time ago. 
user2: I would reccomend it if you like Jim Carey
user2: *seen
user1: Jim Carey hasnt had a good movie in forever , Ace Ventura was dope
user1: cool thx
user1: have a great day!
user1: opps not done yet lol
user2: Yes, he has not been in anything in recent years. 
user2: It was also directed by Tom Shadyac.
user1: ahhhh, i dont know who that is
user1: im bad with director names lol
user1: any other cast that are well known?
user2: Morgan Freeman is another major cast member, who played God in the movie
user2: Jennifer Aniston is also in the movie
user1: Nice!
user1: i might watch it
user1: I dont think i have many more questions , other than where to watch it
user2: Yes, Jennifer Aniston is always nice to see. It also has Lisa Ann Walter
user1: haha nice
user1: im not sure who Lisa is 
user2: Since it was done in 2003, you can probably see it on Pay Per View
user1: True
user2: Philip Baker is another lesser known cast member.
user2: You should enjoy it!
user1: if you need a good movie to see i can recommend Pop Star Never Stop Popping
user1: Also The Guest
user1: Hush
user1: thx!
user1: cya good luck!
user2: You're welcome!

conversation:
user2: Hi, I hear you went to see a movie recently.
user1: Yes, I went to see Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan
user2: How Carrey's performance?
user2: How *was Carrey's performance?
user1: Carrey was hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but the movie get's bogged down in treacle
user2: Who were the co-stars?
user1: Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly & Morgan Freeman playing God
user2: I love Morgan Freeman. Did he have a large role in the movie or just a cameo?
user1: Well he complains to Morgan Freeman (God) that he isn't doing his job correctly and is offered a chance to try being God for a week
user2: Was Jennifer Aniston the love interest?
user1: All I'll say is it's one of Jim Carrey's best films. He plays a News reporter that hopes to become an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. It's hilarious.
user2: Would you consider this a family friendly film?
user1: Well maybe if I told you a bit more of the story you might be able to determine if this might be the right fit. 
user2: Okay, what was your favorite scene?
user1: Well, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. Bruce, suffers from constant bad luck. Bruce reaches a breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from an unaired segment by Bruce while accepting the promotion on air. This was my favorite scene. 
user2: How large is Steve Carrell's role in the movie? Does he have a lot of scenes?
user1: I don't want to give away the entire movie all at once. But I will say I definitely recommend it. 
user2: Is there any nudity or foul language I need to worry about kids seeing?
user1: You are putting me in a tight spot here. I really don't want to spoil anything. How about this: I'll say that Bruce uses hispowers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.
user1: But that's all you're getting out of me. Does that sound like hilarity for the whole family or what?
user2: Yes. Is close captioning available for this movie?
user1: I am not sure about that but I do think the concept is great. After becoming God for a week, Bruce begins to hear voices in his head; prayers to God, that Bruce must deal with. He creates an e-mail system to receive prayers and respond to them - but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle, even with the use of his powers. So he sets the program to automatically answer "Yes" to every prayer, thinking this will make everyone happy. Crazy right?
user2: Sounds great.
user2: Do you know what the movie's rating is? PG? PG13?
user2: About how long was the movie? 2 hours? 1 & 1/2 hours?
user1: Don't seem to recall. But you know, I will say it doesn't drag for too long. And I tend to enjoy films with deeper meanings. And the film ends with a homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages that Bruce previously ran into on various occasions; finally revealing himself to be God. So it's definitely a film you can bring a friend or date to. That said- Go out and see this comedy today!
user2: Did you think the balance of comedy and drama was good? Was it too slapstick?
user1: It does get slightly bogged down by treacle, but the comedy more than makes up for it. It wasn't too slapstick. Just the right amount of funny. 
user2: Thanks, your input was really helpful.
user1: No problem

conversation:
user1: I liked Morgan Freeman in the role as God.
user2: Truly is one of Jim Carey's best films.
user1: I agree. Why do you think it wasn't rated very well on Rotten Tomatoes?
user2: I feel like although Carey did superb on his slapstick scenes, the audience just did not like the overused 'news anchor' treacle. I'm surprised that Cinemascore graded it an A.
user1: Now that you mention it, that aspect of the critical analysis might've been accurate. I think audiences usually expect pure comedy from Jim Carrey. I actually think he's an underrated dramatic actor-- what do you think?
user2: I agree, with the likes of actors such as Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman and Lisa Ann Walters;  it is safe to say that audience members perhaps expected a lot more of a cinematic experience with such grade A actors. About him being underrated, i do feel that it is for a fault not of his own. Writers and film directors sometimes selfishly record scenes without thinking of possible backlash to the actors they hire.
user1: True, sometimes directors and writers want to appeal to a lower common denominator of viewer. So you felt that the cast was strong? I wasn't too big of a fan of Jennifer Anniston in this. I don't think she has much range as an actress, but she does always come across as likable. 

conversation:
user1: Hey you there? :D
user2: Hey, whats up.
user1: Are you in the mood for some comedy movie?
user2: Sure any movie you have in mind?
user1: Bruce Almighty, one of my top 5 favorite if not top 3 favorite comedy movies of all time.
user2: Hahahaha
user2: Same here!
user2: I love that movie, Im a huge fan of Jim Carrey.
user1: Damn.
user1: Can we be best friends? :D
user2: Hahaha, this is definitely a movie ? I would to watch again and again.
user1: No doubt about it haha.
user1: Hahaha, right, remember Evan Backstabber, Baxter! Rather... hahaha
user2: Hahaha! 
user2: Steve Carell!
user1: Right! haha!
user2: I think thats the first time I saw him. In that movie.
user1: Yeah.
user1: I think its his kind of a breakout movie?
user2: I would think so yeah.
user2: Because I havent heard about him before.
user2: That movie.
user1: Ohhh right right, well the movie is already more than a decade ago so, haha. Remember the scene where he put a lot of weed inside the van of the other news network in order for him to cover the story to himself? Haha.
user2: Haha, I remember almost every scene yes, I can even still remember when he "played the trumpet" on his video camera?
user1: Yeah the old one, that was clever haha./
user1: Although, can you believe it?! Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie of only a 48% rating and an average of 5.7 out of 10!?
user2: Lol, I mean I never trust these guys.
user2: Theyre kind of a hit or miss, critics generally. haha. Anyways, I loved how they ended the scene though.
user1: Hahaha
user1: Right right.
user1: And thats the way the cookie crumbles.
user2: I need to right that down haha

conversation:
user1: Do you like Jim Carrey movies?
user2: Yeah, I grew up watching a lot of them and I still think they're funny and think he did a pretty good job in non-comedy too
user2: What about you? and did you like this one?
user1: I honestly feel exactly the same about Jim Carrey, and yes I liked it I thought it was a good idea
user1: I like Morgan Freeman as God
user2: Yeah, me too!  It was the first time I went to a theater to see something by him since I was a kid. Yeah I think he did a good job as god too.  It was hilarious in the movie theater hearing people when they found out who played god
user1: Did you see what this critic said? Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor." 
user1: Don't think he's a Carrey fan
user2: Lol.. yeah "a real actor". Comedies are still real acting, and besides that, Eternal sunshine is still one of my favorite movies.  I don't think that was out yet though. Sounds like the typical thing a critic with his head up his ass would say , though
user1: YES I love that movie
user1: Critics love to hate
user2: Yeah definitely
user1: BTW my favorite part of the movie is when he sees Jennifer Anistons prayers
user1: I teared up
user1: and Im a guy
user2: heh yeah.. i saw the same type of deal with prayers on an old SNES movie and they both made me sad. one funny thing.. I still think of that movie every time I have to spell out b e a utiful
user2: I think one of the funniest parts is when he pulls in the moon, then it ends up having catastrophic effects with the tides and he sees that in the morning news 
user1: Haha I don't remember that
user1: I also forgot that Steve Carell is in it, which is weird because I don't think the sequel acknowledges that
user2: I never did see the sequel but it seemed kind of lame. I completely forgot that he was in there until you mentioned that and had to take a look at the document on the side lol
user2: holy shit the part with jimmy hoffa was hilarous
user1: Nowhere near as good but apparently the critics didn't like this one either
user1: Don't remember that scene either, I really gotta see it again
user1: So what else can we say about the movie?
user2: hmm I think they could have done a better job with romance thing. it happens in every movie where their relationship basically ends in disaster then they get back together and everything is awesome at the end.  then again its not like his movie was innovative in that sense though lol
user2: I dont think steve carell was really famous by the time this came out was he?
user2: Im really bad at remembering when things happened like that
user1: Me too
user1: I agree with the romance thing
user2: If not I'm sure this movie helped him out quite a bit
user1: Not with his fame but probably helped him land 40 year old virgin
user2: Just saw that the movie came out the year that I graduated from high school lol, I felt like Jim Carrey was kind of coming to the end of his most popular period. He still did quite well for a long time after.
user2: Ah yeah , I forgot about that one. didn't quite like it
user2: I'd like to see some more comedy by him, but it seems like he kinda lost it not that long ago lol
user1: Really? I loved it though some of the jokes were kinda lame but I'm not gonna repeat the language
user1: You mean his mind?
user2: Yeah
user1: Its weird like a comedian thing right? Robin Williams was also troubled
user2: Just getting wrecked by the news really.  I hate when things like that effect peoples views on actors acting , though
user2: same thing happened with tom cruise 
user1: I think its just drugs, a little too much psychedelics maybe
user1: Haha Tom is a different story
user2: lol yeah thats funny. now that you say that , i could totally see that being the cause. especially while picturing him with the big beard
user1: Tom is a cult leader
user2: yeah.. a whole new level of crazy
user1: Tom is hurting the world, Jim seems to just be hurting himself
user2: yeah.. a lot of comedic, and just actors in general have problems with a lot of stuff and get dragged into things a lot of times. its probably both a part of the kind of personality that you have to have with that and also part of how people treat them

user1: I was surprised that it only got 48%
user1: What did you think about Lisa Ann Walter?
user2: Lisa Ann Walter  made one the best roles of her career
user1: She really did.
user2: maybe the reviews are little low because are almost 15 years that this movie has shown
user2: In 2003 where the Bruce Almighty is shown there wasn't  so much social media as now
user1: That's a good point.
user1: CinemaScore gave it an A.

user1: holy cow ;O
user2: I remember seeing it in theaters
user1: why a ten buddy

user2: Because the whole movie is brilliant. 
user1: no i saw it on my ten ich laptop
user1: inch
user2: Still a good experience I bet
user1: yea ;]

user1: the
user2: Good point. I never thought of that

user2: Hello
user1: Hi! I just watched the movie "Bruce Almighty." Have you seen it?
user2: I've seen it a long time ago!
user2: But I don't think I enjoyed it that much tbh
user2: What did you think of it?
user1: Who was your favorite actor in it? I personally loved Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God?
user1: I found it to be a really great and funny movie!
user2: I did like Morgan Freeman!
user2: But I also like him in every role he plays
user2: I think all the actors were pretty good overall
user1: Yes Morgan Freeman is always a great actor.
user1: I think his costar Lisa Ann Walter was good as well. She totally owned many of the scenes that she was in!
user2: She was! I also like Jennifer Aniston. She's always done well in comedies
user1: Yes she's always a great actress!
user1: I think the reviewers had the right idea of the comedic possibilities of this movie.
user2: Yeah this movie was pretty creative in a way
user1: The idea behind it really was great. And I loved the way the Bruce helped out his friends.
user2: I wonder how what people would think of it if the movie came out recently versus 2003
user1: Well I think it'd really have the same story so it probably would be just about as popular... Maybe there would be changes in some actors but that shouldn't have too big of an affect on its popularity.
user2: I don't think it would be as popular, just because we've seen so many similar comedies come out since then
user2: I'm also curious as to how people would react to the "God" theme now
user1: I can't really think of many similar comedies myself. I'm sure some have been done but I'm guessing this was probably the ineptus of them so this actually would be original.
user1: Well it wasn't a serious religious movie so I'm guessing people would be ok with it. Although it feels like there's been quite a bit of religious tension going on lately so maybe it would be less popular than I'm thinking.
user2: very true
user2: Actually now that I think of it, this was a pretty good movie. I think I'm just a bit cynical over slapstick comedies
user1: I loved the scenes towards the beginning where he's having mischievous fun with all of his new found powers. That reminds me of how most people probably would really react. Or least how they fantasize about it.
user2: I liked the twist at the end about that homeless guy. It was a cute end for the movie
user2: I completely forgot Steve Carell was in this. He was perfect for his role
user1: Yes that was hilarious! It was full of twists and turns.
user1: Thinking about it a bit more there was a bit more praying in this movie than I might except in a mainstream movie about mainstream people.
user2: I'm glad the movie had a happy ending. Of course I wasn't expecting anything else but it was still nice
user2: Yeah I think the way they went about religion and prayers in this would be much different if it came out today
user1: Well most movies do have happy endings but that's so trite and boring. Still it does bring a smile to my face and make me feel a bit good that everyone's still happy.
user1: It would be really interesting to see how different it would be 15 years later. Lots of things have changed in that time. But good comedy is still good comedy!
user2: I like that these sort of movie always have a good message. Even if it's one as simple as "be happy with what you have"
user2: Thank you for your time! Have a nice day!
user1: Lol yeah feel good movies are fun. They do always lift up my spirits!

user2: Hi
user1: Hi! I just watched the movie "Bruce Almighty" Have you seen it?
user2: No, is it good?
user1: I thought it was a very enjoyable light hearted comedy. Jim Carrey's performance was amazing!
user2: Shut up noob
user2: This turk is trash
user2: You're a bot
user2: You take too long to type
user1: I thought Morgan Freeman gave a really good performance in it as well. He's one of my favorite actors.
user2: ???? nigga

conversation:
user1: Hello there :)
user2: Hello! Have you heard of the movie Bruce Almighty?
user1: So what is the name of the new movie
user2: Bruce Almighty! Have you heard of it?
user1: Haven't heard of that one.  How good is it, would you suggest I check it out?
user2: Apparently it has Jim Carrey in it.
user2: Which, if you love comedy, yes! 
user1: sounds like something similar to Batman, is it
user1: I absolutely adore comedy
user2: I'm not sure if it is similar to Batman. 
user1: what's the main theme, or plot of the movie, 
user1: Bruce Wayne, of course, is how I came that conclusion?  Though Carrey is one of my favs
user2: So Jim Carrey plays as the main character, named Bruce. And is working for a tv station but wants to be the main news anchorman. He goes on this journey in search of his goal, while engaging with... guess
user2: MORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!! He plays as the God character. 
user2: Also Bruce (Carrey) has a girlfriend named Grace played by Jennifer Aniston. 
user1: Freeman, as a God character, way funny!!!
user2: Right??
user2: The movie was made in 2003.
user1: Love Jenn Aniston, anything she is in, has to be a hit
user2: So a bit of an old movie.
user1: oh, okay, now why would Carrey need the God figure?
user1: there's nothing pertaining to death, or immortality, or life after death, is it?
user2: Bruce finds out he somehow has powers, and eventually hears voices, and the voice turns into... God! 
user1: lol!
user2: Who explains that the voices are people's prayers TO God
user1: how touching....
user2: Bruce is pretty annoyed by the voice of God, but God tells him he needs help. 
user2: And nope, nothing with death that I see... 
user1: sounds like it has a spiritual flare, or theme to it, then someone who is highly religious, or spiritual would get a kick out of this one, you think?
user2: God shows up to tell Bruce, who is suffering relationship issues with Grace aka Aniston, to pray for what he wants, since Bruce ends up going through a tale/journey of funny woes
user2: It does touch on religion. That would be subjective!
user2: Bruce has been having relationship issues with his girlfriend, who God helps with
user2: And they eventually become married. 
user2: So if you like sappy, comedy movies, this is that!
user1: oh I see.  How about Aniston, is who supportive to Bruce goals?
user2: They become engaged, so it can be implied. But you would have to watch the movie!
user1: how does Jenn Aniston react to Bruce's dilemna?
user1: Engaged, that's exciting, and a nice twist, or turn of events
user2: No word on her opinion. The plot is more about Bruce and God. 
user2: But,
user1: it's primarily an adult movie, it sounds like. What age group would it cater to, like , how young and audience?
user2: after the journey of having to deal with hearing all the voices "prayers" and Bruce having to figure out how to deal with those, which is figured out in the movie, and after the engagement. The film ends with a man whom is homeless...
user2: who is shown in the beginning of the movie apparently
user2: who holds a sign with philosophical messages that Bruce had seen, 
user2: and at the end of the movie, the homeless guy shows himself as the God. Aka, MORGAN FREEMAN
user1: oh I see, once again, a nice turn of events
user2: The movie got a CinemaScore of A. No rating shown to me!
user1: how ironic, that the homeless guy is actually God
user2: Age wise. 
user1: still from your depiction, it sounds like a movie I would definitely want to check out
user2: That's a positive thing, it sounds like! 
user1: especially with an A rating
user1: ...indeed it is!
user1: I've got the gist of it now. Unless there is something more that you think I should be aware of, then I believe we can finish up our conversation, you agree?
user2: The weird thing in the movie, to me, is how the movie starts with him just trying to get a job promotion... but ends up meeting God.....
user2: Lisa Ann Walter and Philip Baker Hall are also main characters in the movie
user1: oh, okay, that is a bit weird, you're right
user1: another set of superb actors and actresses
user2: Someone left a critical response review claiming "one of Jim Carrey's best films" 
user2: So it sounds good!
user2: In my opinion. 
user2: And according to the movie.
user1: I'm impressed, and am sold by your review and opinions, actually. And will def make it a point to check this one out.

user1: hello
user2: Hello
user1: you're reading about a movie?
user2: So we're talking about Bruce Almighty.
user1: i see
user2: Do you know anything about the movie?
user1: yes i do!
user1: it stars jim carry
user1: and he is gifted the powers of GOD
user2: Yes, it's one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies!
user2: I feel like Morgan Freeman really should be the voice of God too. LOL
user2: Evidently Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 48% and average 5.7/10. I don't really know what that means though.
user1: oh really
user1: that's a below average score...
user1: based on that i shouldn't have watched it lol
user2: Is it? I don't really follow Rotten Tomatoes...I guess that's why. LOL
user1: one of the memorable scenes in that movie is jim carrey pulling the moon towards himself
user2: This says the critical response is that "Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle."
user2: What the heck is treacle?
user2: YES! The moon! That was very cool.
user1: i've heard of treacle tart
user1: some kind of british thing
user1: dessert like
user1: sticky perhaps?
user2: Jennifer Aniston did a really good job as his girlfriend in the movie too. She made me cry!
user2: Haha Maybe!
user2: Or maybe "too sweet and mushy"?? LOL
user2: Oh! And I think this may have been the first movie that I saw Steve Carrell in too!
user1: hmm i don't remember him in it
user2: Tom Shadyac was the director. I don't think I've ever heard of him.
user2: Yeah Steve was the guy that was I think given the job that Jim Carrey wanted.
user2: Evan Baxter was his name in the movie.
user2: I don't think I'm doing this chat thing right. I think I was supposed to convince you to either watch the movie or not watch the movie. But you've already seen it, so...whatever. Haha

user2: Nooo!!
user2: I think we're supposed to keep talking til it ends itself.
user2: I keep getting new paragraphs here.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi. What did you think of Bruce Almighty?
user1: It is one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies. It had that Ace Ventura style humor but didn't rely solely on slap stick scenes to make you laugh.
user1: What was your favorite scene form the movie?
user1: from*
user2: I can see what you mean. It isn't a personal favorite of mine, but I tend to shy away from some of his comedies in general. I'm not a big fan of anything with much slapstick at all.
user2: I like that he was given the opportunity to have the job of God though. It did have some deeper meaning that I enjoyed.
user1: Liar Liar might triumph over this movie now that I think about it, but I still think they are both great in their own ways.
user2: I'm surprised at how low of a score it has on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: That's very true. It had a deeper meaning than most of his other comedies. People can always complain about other peoples duties til they are doing it themselves.
user2: That's very true.
user1: I know, 5.7 is very low. Then again it's based off of peoples opinions. What matters is what you think of the movie.
user2: Do you have a second movie synopsis now? I just got a blank second page on my screen.
user1: I did. Basically it describes a key scene where Bruce is passed up for the opportunity for Anchor by Evan Baxter.
user2: Oh, okay. I remember that scene vaguely. I haven't seen the movie in a long time.
user1: Also mentions the crush he had on Susan Ortega although he was in a relationship with Grace.
user2: Oh, I don't remember that at all. 
user2: Was he engaged to Grace?
user1: He was. Took him the whole movie to do it. She was lead on to believe many times during the movie that he was going to propose but he was being selfish.
user1: Her friend made her feel he was going to propose too. She got her hopes up  even more so when he took her out for dinner to tell her he got anchor, she was happy but disappointed at the same time.
user1: Have you seen the sequel Evan Almighty?
user1: I haven't watched it yet
user2: Ah, that's right. I just got the synopsis on my screen. I had forgotten a lot of the movie. I just read about the prayer e-mail system he set up. That was pretty funny.
user2: I have not seen that one.
user2: I heard that it was good though.
user1: Yeah. He set up the prayer email and then eventually he could hear peoples prayers in his head.
user2: Do you remember him finding Jimmy Hoffa in the movie? Funny!
user1: It was driving him crazy at the beginning because he wasn't used to it.
user1: yes!
user1: Then he planted the drugs in the other news anchors van.
user2: Hilarious. I guess I need to watch it again. I would probably enjoy it more than I remember.
user1: I think we are supposed to be talking about the key scene in the passage.
user1: lol
user1: The rules are kind of long winded and I can't remember every thing 100% but let's discuss it the best you can remember so we both get paid lol.
user2: Okay.. trying. I am confused about it though. So, it's sweet that Bruce prays for Grace to find a man that makes her truly happy.
user1: Yes. It proved he went from being selfish to learning what he took for granted, his girlfriend.
user2: I liked the take on saying "yes" to every prayer. It really makes you think about  prayer and the kinds of things  people pray for versus what is actually best.
user1: He was using his powers selfishly at first but then he realized at  the end he didn't need to be powerful to live a fulfilling life.
user2: Yes. I suppose it's essentially a redemption story, isn't it?
user1: Very true. If God answered yes to every prayer, than someone praying for their mother in law to jump out the window might get his wish. Their's consequences to easy outs.
user1: More or less.
user1: there's

user1: Morgan freeman was great as he is in his all movies

user2: yea...I enjoyed the move but ratings are low but thats ok..we love still

user2: yea me too

user1: Steve Carell was also really good as his co-worker
user2: at first I didnt understand it though but I love how his family accepted him and his dreams later in d movie
user2: Oh yes..he is 
user2: he is one of my favorites
user1: do you remember the scene that Jim Carrey makes him talk rubbish while on TV, LIVE
user1: that was really funny
user2: yes hahaha
user2: I wish God warns people like he helped wanted to save dem from the dam collapse
user1: collapse? I do not remember it
user2: the director Tom Shadyac must be a religious man
user1: I think he is definitely not religious
user1: putting Morgan Freeman as a God or humanize the God, is not religious at all
user2: yes..the dam was collapsing thats why Jim had to build an arc to save all the animals and the people but they didnt understand
user1: ohhh, now I remember
user2: oh ...yes, true that
user1: although the movie is not religious, it gave a lot messages
user1: how people should act whether they are not religious or not
user1: that is not expected in a comedy movie
user1: I realized I do not remember some scenes very well, maybe it a reason to re-watch the movie again
user1: aaaaanddd you are gone again

user2: was it funny?
user1: Very
user2: would you see it again?
user1: yes
user2: Interesting. Who starred in the movie?
user1: Jim Carrey
user1: and Morgan Freema
user2: That giy is hilarious. 
user2: I think I'll watch it. Is it on netflix?
user1: I don't know but I imagine
user2: Nice.. 
user2: Do you really love watching movies?
user1: Carrey is an reporter that wants be an anchor but after a long run of bad luck he complains that God isn't doing his work so God offers him his powers for a week
user2: Why did you send me that? 
user1: was writing and din't realise that you had send the message
user1: but yea, haven't had the time recently
user1: I love movies

user1: Very.
user2: Are you okay?
user1: Yea, one learns how to handle everything, but still.

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: The name of the movie is Bruce Almighty
user1: Jim carrey is in it. 
user1: HI 
user2: Yes he is.
user2: HE plays Bruce Nolan
user2: Morgan Freeman plays God
user2: Jennifer Aniston plays Grace Connely, and Lisa Ann Walter plays Debbie COnnely
user1: It is suppose to be funny.
user2: Philip Baker Hall also makes an appearance playing Jack Baylor
user1: It is interesting becuase Bruce - Jim character plays a news reporter.
user2: Bruce almighty was made in 2003 and is a Comedy
user2: It was directed by Tom Shadyac
user2: It was given 48% on Rotton Tomatoes, and a metacritic score of 46/100
user2: But Cinemascore gave it an A
user1: That seems strange that it got two bad rating and one good rating
user2: I thought the same thing
user2: One critic said Carrey is hilarious but the movie got bogged down in treacle
user1: Maybe they didn't watch the same movie - Bruce Almighty - maybe they really like Jim Carrey. 
user2: Another critic made a comment about how Bruce plays a news reporter hoping to bame it big becoming an anchor, comparing it to Carrey's career becoming a real actor
user2: their opinion, not mine!
user1: According to another critical response it is suppose to be hilarious. 
user1: There defintion must be different then the rest of us.
user2: But the movie it self is about a TV reporter complaining  to God that he isn't doing his job, so God offers him the chance to be God for a week.
user1: So he could take his girl of his dreams Grace out to a fancy restaurant. that makes alot of sense... 
user1: I am pretty sure if he heard all voices in his head like he does... It would drive him a bit crazy.. 
user2: yep! So he becomes God, and starts hearing voices which he finds out are peoples prayers. He gets so overwhelemed that he sets a program to automatically answer "yes" to all of them, trying to make everyone happy
user1: His idea of setting response to auto won't cause any problems. 
user2: haha of course not!
user1: It helps him win his job back but everything comes with a price.
user2: He also has a girlfriend (jennifer aniston) and a mild crush on his co-worker Susan Ortega (played by Catherine Bell) who barely seems to notice him
user2: Nearing the end, God appears to Bruce and tells him to pray for what he truly wants, which he prays for Grace to find a man that would make her happy
user1: All he wants to do it make Grace happy.
user2: God's way of making that happen is to put Bruce in the hospital after being miraculously revived by doctors where Grace and he reconcile
user2: And then of course Bruce has a more positive spin on life
user1: So he has a enligtened moment 
user2: Yep!
user1: So basicly the end of the movie is saying God is everywhere... 
user2: And it ends with a homeless man holding a sign with a philosophical message that Bruce had ran into eralier, revealing himself to God

conversation:
user2: Hi. Did you see the movie Bruce Almighty?
user1: I did. I really enjoyed the concept of the film, but the acting seemed to be hit or miss. What about you?
user2: Yes I did also. I found it very entertaining and Morgan Freeman as God was a good choice.
user1: He typically does very well in a variety of roles. I also liked Jennifer Aniston's casting in the role.
user2: Yes. Even though her part was a small one. Jim Carrey was good. This was not his typical slapstick. Although, there was quite a bit of slapstick in the movie.
user1: Do you prefer slapstick comedy like what was present in this movie or more in-depth comedies? 
user2: It depends on my mood. I like high concept comedies but my taste range also includes Tarantino and Lynch. My favorites. 
user1: Very interesting. I like Carrey in some of his more serious roles moreso than his comedy roles. I'm also a big Tarantino fan.
user2: He tried to break out with his usually style. He was not very welcomed by critics. Eternal Sunshine was good.
user1: That is one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm not too sure about how well it was critically acclaimed, but I enjoyed.
user2: Yes. I was very good. Bruce Almighty was also good. The scenes with Jenifer Aniston were very funny. She too is someone who can not seem to get out of her cast type. Steve Carell also is a wonderful dramatic actor. 
user1: I haven't seen many Steve Carrell movies.... is he good in comedies?
user2:  Ten minutes between responses is too long. At 15 exchanges, it will be too long to carry on this chat. I enjoyed what we did exchanges. Sorry. 
user2: Apparently I will not get paid if we do not continue. Yes Steve Carrell is good in movies and television. Do you like him?
user1: Sorry for any issues

conversation:
user1: I think you should watch Bruce Almighty because it has a CinemaScore of an A
user2: Who is the lead actor, is it funny?
user1: Jim Carrey is the lead actor, and it is indeed a comedy.
user2: Stellar, I might have seen this already. I enjoyed it. Sounds like a replay for me!
user1: If you saw a movie about a down-on-his-luck tv reporter that gets the powers of God, that's the one.
user2: Sure did! Does the movie seem like it goes quickly or do you feel there are slow parts in the film? 
user1: I think it is fast. The hilarious slapstick makes time fly by.
user2: That's the only humor that speaks to my IQ.
user2: I'm looking forward to it. 
user1: I like that they cast Morgan Freeman as God, too. The whole cast was well-picked.
user1: Some of the critical reception to the movie was a bit mixed, though.
user2: Morgan Freeman is a pretty great God. Jim Carrey loses his mind. This is the first in the "almighty" series, right? I think the second is Evan Almighty. 
user1: Yup, Steve Carrell is in both! Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is jealous of him and is seen as too comedic by Carrell.
user2: Was he a news anchor in Evan Almighty?
user1: I don't know about that movie, but he does play one in this movie. Phillip Baker Hall played Jack Baylor, who I think was the TV station head honcho.
user2: I think you are right.
user2: I think that's how the cookie crumbles.
user1: I like how Bruce used his powers to spice up some news events that would've been mundane otherwise. Like finding Jimmy Hoffa's body.
user2: Or pulling in the moon to set the mood.
user1: It was also interesting when he started answering "yes" to every prayer.
user2: It's like email at the office. Then the follow scene with cars on fire and total chaos was a nice transition.
user1: The director was Tom Shadyac--have you seen anything else he's done?
user2: I'm not sure, do you know what other films he has directed?
user1: I don't know--I liked his direction--even if some critics called Carrey was nursing "hopes of one day becoming a real actor" throughout.
user2: Jim Carrey is pretty one dimensional but I feel like it worked in this movie.
user1: Maybe it was more the writing, but I felt empathy when he killed himself, and asked God to just let Grace find a man that will make her happy.
user2: I totally forgot about that part. 
user1: And then he wakes up in the hospital with her close by.

conversation:
user2: dude
user2: I told you I will talk to you about a movie today

user1: No, I have never seen it.
user2: Owh, it is a comedy film way back year 2003 
user1: Was it hilariously funny or just awful?
user2: It is a high concept movie writen by steve Koren
user2: well judging by the cinemascore rating it was a good movie
user1: Does he normally write a good script?
user2: but going by metacritic and rotten tomatoes I would say the movie must be kind of awful
user1: Oh, just how low are the scores?
user2: CinemaScore;A, 
user2: rotten tomatoes;48%
user2: metacritic;46/100
user1: I don't think they liked it much.

user1: have you?
user2: yes
user2: a longgg time ago
user2: i thought it was an interesting concept as a movie
user2: but i feel that it would still be hard to really depict what it would be like to be a god
user1: true
user1: but, they took the funny route
user2: yeah I liked that
user2: i recently watched little nicky or whatever it's called with Adam Sandler and it kinda reminded me of it, using religion and deities in a comedy

conversation:

user1: I am not sure on either of those questions
user2: ok
user2: is it related to Evan Almighty? that was a funny movie and has a similar name
user1: Evan Almighty is number 2
user2: I see. that's cool.
user1: If you did like evan, you will love seeing bruce almighty
user2: ok. did bruce almighty win any sort of awards?
user1: I do not know that one sorry
user2: what else is interesting about the movie?
user2: any funny quotes?
user1: Jim Carrey is hilarous in the slapstick scenes, but bruce almighty gets bogged down in treacle

user2: who is the director?
user1: Tom Shadyac
user2: alrighty. i guess i'll have to check it out
user1: yes you should

conversation:
user1: Hey, so what did you think of the flick?
user2: Jim Carrey is the best!! 
user1: I liked Morgan Freeman more though
user2: He's pretty awesome. 
user1: Can you believe how old this movie is now though?
user2: Oh wow I didn't even think about that!
user2: I was in high school lol
user1: Right? It's been fifteen years since it released.
user2: Just about.
user2: Doesn't seem that long ago. 
user2: I've never heard of the director
user1: Time flies.
user1: Me either. I wonder what Shadyac's imdb page looks like.
user2: I would love it if I could actually see the second document.
user1: .I'm on the second one now?
user1: I think I saw a refresh
user1: But it just looks like the same with less data
user2: It's there, just blank.
user1: Yup, sure enough
user2: I have always thought Jennifer Aniston was to serious
user1: I think she did a decentish job
user1: And somebody has to play the straight man for the jokes to land
user2: Ah true. Rotten Tomatoes sure gave it a low score
user1: Yeah, but it was adored by the general public I think. at least I enjoyed it
user1: That could be the nostalgia glasses kicking in though
user2: I don't think I ever heard anything bad about it.
user1: Same here, but I wasn't looking at movies with a critical eye when it released.
user2: Wasn't there an Evan Almighty afterward?
user1: Yeah, but I think we are supposed to just talk about the info given.
user1: at least I have a second screen of info this time
user2: Wasn't sure if that was just in my old mind or not. Thanks. ;-0
user1: Did you enjoy Steve Carell in this flick?
user2: Yea he is funny also. But in a better way than Carrey somehow
user1: Those daily show alumns they were pretty great. I think I liked Carrey more though
user2: He did a good job, but he also got the funnier spot than Carrell
user1: Very true. Carell gets his time to shine in the sequel.
user2: very true and in other
user2: others*

conversation:
user1: Hi, how are you?
user2: Hey! I'm good. I was just reading about a movie, Bruce Almighty. Have you seen it?
user1: I haven't. What's it about?
user2: It's basically about a reported (played by Jim Carrey) who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) about his job. So God tries to help him for a week
user2: But of course since Carrey is the main character, there are a ton of comedic moments between him and Freeman
user2: I love Morgan Freeman haha
user1: Oh. Sounds a little funny. Jim Carrey gets on my nerves a little but I enjoy Morgan Freeman. 
user2: Yeah, I can understand that. Honestly I think a lot of people feel that way because the movie only has a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: I would watch it for Morgan Freeman though. 
user1: I mean I like Carrey to an extent, but sometimes he can be annoying, because it's like his humor is always the same. Yeah, and he sounds like what I think God would sound like haha.
user1: Morgan Freeman that is.
user2: Omg haha I think everyone thinks God would sound like Morgan Freeman
user2:  Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell are in it too! 
user1: I love Jennifer Aniston, but who doesn't. 
user2: I really like them, they probably make up for Carrey's goofiness and make the movie a bit more enjoyable
user1: Who does she play?
user2: She's Carrey's girlfriend haha
user2: But Bruce (Carrey) also has a crush on his co-worker, Susan (played by Catherine Bell)
user1: That would be an odd couple!
user1: I can't place Catherine Bell.
user2: I honestly don't know anything about her. What
user2: What's some of her big movies?
user1: And how do you have another crush if your girlfriend in Aniston lol.
user2: True that haha
user1: Whose big movies? Bell? I don't know who she is.
user1: What is your favorite part of the movie?
user2: Probably just all of the funny stuff Bruce has God do for him to help him out with his job
user2: Like when Bruce makes a co-worker humiliate himself on the air so he gets fired and Bruce can take his job
user1: When did the movie come out? You don't hear much out of Carrey lately it seems.
user2: 2003. Definitely older
user2: I think this was right after the Ace Ventura movies
user2: Also I'm pretty sure Carrey's girlfriend passed away recently and they thought he had something to do with it. I can't imagine he'd be filming anything with something like that having just happened
user1: Yeah, I remember reading something about that awhile back. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!
user2: What movie did you watch?
user1: Bruce Almighty! I love Jim Carrey.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Awesome!  No, I haven't seen it yet and I was thinking about watching it though.
user2: What is it about?
user1: Oh it's hilarious. It didn't receive a huge score on rotten tomatoes, but it had a really good cinema score. 
user2: What is it about?
user1: It's about a down on his luck reporter who complains to God and is offered a chance to be God for a week.
user2: And the reporter is Jim Carrey?
user1: Yes the reporter is Jim Carrey and it also stars Jennifer Aniston as his wife and Steve Carell as the antagonist. 
user2: I like Jim Carrey, he's a riot.  I don't know about Jennifer Anniston, so they had a happy marriage?
user1: He actually has a crush on his co-worker, played by Catherine Bell, so there's some conflict with his relationship with Jennifer Aniston. 
user2: Oh, okay.  How does he get to be God?
user2: Does he have special powers?
user1: God is played by Morgan Freeman, and by complaining to God about his situation, Morgan Freeman offers him the opportunity to be God for a week.
user1: Yes, Bruce(Jim Carrey) does have special powers that allow him to cause miraculous events for the week he plays God.
user2: That sounds hilarious.  Morgan Freeman is so respectable.
user2: Did anyone know he was God or was it a secret?
user1: It is hilarious, he ends up causing his co-worker/antagonist, Steve Carell, to embarrass himself on live television by using his powers. 
user2: That does sound funny.
user1: He also creates an e-mail system to streamline prayer responses.
user2: lol How does that work out for him/
user1: Well, he found that even after streamlining the system, he was getting too many emails so he created an auto response system, granting everyone their prayers.
user2: That's funny.
user1: Near the end, God ends up telling Bruce that he needs to pray for what he really wants. He prays for Jennifer Aniston to find a man that will make her happy. 
user2: Does he just revert back to reporter after a week?
user1: He does end up reverting back to reporter after a week with a newfound pleasure in the simple stories he previously reported.
user2: Do he and Anniston break up?
user1: They actually announce their engagement on live television.
user2: Thanks for the info on the movie.  I will probably watch it now.
user2: Take care!
user1: You too!

user1: im really not sure where to go from here...
user2: He torturing steve carell was gold
user1: yes it was, thats  my favorite part of the movie. definitely a knee slapper
user1: him standing on the balcony yelling "smite me now, god!!!"
user2: i think the movie got a low rotten tomatoes because jim carrey always kinda place the same character
user1: personally i dont think it deserved such a low rating. i enjoyed it
user1: hes always the funny guy that never gets a serious role
user2: he has one serious role on his belt the rest are comedy
user2: his movies havent aged well

user2: i can watch that over and over again
user2: were like peas and carrots
user1: Bruce also finds ways of using the power to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers
user2: mundan events like what 
user1: After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her about his promotion (disappointing her as she thought he was going to propose) I thought that was a sad part of the movie 
user2: what did they eat 
user1: such as discovering the body of Jimmy Hoffa, earning him his job back, or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off
user2: yummy cookoffs are good 

conversation:
user2: hey there
user1: Hi, tell me about this movie
user2: Have you never seen it?
user1: I don't know anything about it. What is the full title?
user2: Bruce Almighty
user1: Okay, no. I've never seen the movie. Can you tell me about it?
user2: Jim Carrey(Bruce) had trouble with his life and blamed everything on God
user2: So God" heard him and thought how fun it would be to see if Bruce could do a better job at being God"
user2: At first Bruce liked it because he could make all his wishes come true, the girl,car,job
user2: But after reality set in that God" has a bigger job than just making people happy Bruce got overwhelmed 
user1: Okay, Is it a comedy?
user2: Yes
user2: its super funny
user2: really I like anything that Jim Carrey is in
user1: Cool! Are there any other major actors in it?
user2: Morgan Freemna

user1: What kind of ratings did it get?
user2: not sure maybe 4
user1: Okay!
user1: It sounds like a good movie
user1: I imagine Morgan Freeman was the voice of God
user2: Director was Tom Shadyac
user2: Yes lol
user1: I also like Jim Carrey
user1: I just don't know a whole lot about him
user1: But he seems funny and perfect for a movie like this
user2: Yes the roles fit all the character 
user1: But it sounds good. I'll have to remember it when I'm looking for something to watch
user1: Yeah, it sounds like it
user2: Critical response : Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes 
user2: Best film Jim Carrey was in 
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gave it 48%
user2: But CinemaScore :A
user1: rotten Tomatoes can be a tough one haha
user1: But the other ratings are good
user1: It's good to know
user2: In the film Bruce was a news reporter 

conversation:
user2: Hi! Have you seen the movie Bruce Almighty? It is a great comedy movie!
user1: hi, yes, Bruce Almighty is a great Comedy movie.  Did you enjoy Jim Carrey's performance?
user2: Yes I did, but I think my favorite character was Morgan Freeman as God. Do you know who directed the movie?
user1: I believe Tom Shadyac directed Bruce Almighty.  what did the ratings say about the movie?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 48% and average 5.7/10, Metacritic gave it a score of 46/100, and CinemaScore gave it an A!
user1: Too bad rotten tomatoes and Metacritic didn't give Bruce Almighty a better score.   I think it was written well by Steve Karen, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk. 
user2: Yeah, the movie was about Bruce Nolan a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.
user1: Yeah, I think Bruce was a news reporter that wanted to become anchor.  Did you know Philip Baker Hall was in this movie?
user2: I didn't know that! But I remember Jennifer Aniston played his girlfriend, Grace Connelly.
user1: That's right! Jennifer Aniston, Jim Carrey, Morgran Freeman, what a great cast!
user2: Exactly! Wasn't this movie released in 2003?
user1: yeah, Catherine Bell and the Hilarious Steve Carell were in this movie too.  
user2: Yeah, this movie is known for it's hilarious slapstick scenes!
user1: I didn't like the character Bruce having a girlfriend and while he had a crush on Susan Ortega. 
user2: `Yeah and I hated that Bruce's boss passed him over for a promotion and gave it to Steve Carell's character, Evan Baxter.
user1: what a thief!  Evan Baxter stole Bruce's dialogue off air.  Did you think Bruce had bad luck?
user2: Yes definitely, that is what caused him to reach him breaking point and led to him gaining God's powers. What did he use his powers to cause?
user1: He used his powers to discover the body of Jimmy Hoffa and caused a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off.  Did you see what he did to Evan?
user2: Yes! He caused Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.
user1: Bruce started experiencing some voices in his head during a fancy dinner with Grace.  Do you remember what happened to Bruce?
user2: Yeah, he re-encounters God, who informs him that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce has to deal with them. What did he do to help deal with all the prayers?
user1: Bruce Created an email system to receive prayers sets the program to automatically answer "Yes" to every prayer.  Bruce though this will make everyone happy. 
user2: Yeah and then God appeared and told Bruce to pray for what he truly wants, do you remember what he prayed for?
user1: Yeah, Bruce prays for Grace to find a man that would make him happy.  God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being miraculous revived by the doctors.  Did you like what happened to Bruce after that?
user2: Yes i did! I liked that he was finally able to return to reporting but he was finally able to find pleasure in simple stories. Do you remember what Bruce announced live on TV?
user1: Bruce and Grace Announce their engagement on TV!  How did you like the ending of the movie?
user2: It was great! I couldn't believe the homeless man who had been holding inspirational signs throughout the movie was actually God in disguise.
user1: I liked how Bruce returns to the field but takes more pleasure in simple stories.
user2: Yes this really was a great movie, and a good movie to watch with family or on a date.
user1: Yes it is! Have a great night!

conversation:
user2: HI there have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: Yes I have. I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Have you seen it?
user2: Do you know what character Jim Carrey 
user1: He played Bruce
user2: Yes I did I loved it. Do you know what is was rated on Rotten Tomato?
user1: Yes it was rated 48%. Not a great rating
user2: Agreed, not a good rating, it could have been better. Who else acted in it?
user1: Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston. Do you like them?
user2: I love Morgan Freeman. I think Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes. Do you think its one of Carrey’s best movies?
user1: Yes I do
user1: I also liked The Mask.
user1: Though my very favorite is The Truman Show. How about you?
user2: Me too. What job did Bruce the character do in the movie?
user1: He worked in the news but no one took him seriously.
user1: What genre would you say it is?
user2: Thats right I remember, he worked as a field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV. Its a comedy. Was Jennifer Aniston he’s wife in the movie?
user1: She plays his girlfriend, not his wife. I think he proposes at the end but I don't remember
user1: Was the director Tom Shadyac?
user2: Thats right and the script was written by Steve Koren. What does Bruce suffer from in this movie?
user1: He has very bad luck but that begins to change when he becomes God. 
user1: It was an interesting take on religion
user2: Haha thats a funny and imaginative plot.
user2: I think he finds ways to use the powers to cause miraculous events.
user1: Yes it also features Phillip Baker Hall and Lisa Ann Walter
user1: Yes that it is correct he does that several times. 
user2: Do you know what year it was released?
user1: It was released in 2003. Did you see it in theaters? 
user2: Thats correct, watched it in the cinema. I liked the scene when God appears to Bruce and tells him to pray for what he really wants. Whats your favourite scene?
user1: I like the ending where a homeless man appears with messages from God
user1: Did you like the end?
user2: Yes I did. It was with a homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages.
user2: This movie received a Cinema Score of A
user1: Yes that is correct.
user2: How long was Bruce God for?
user1: He was God for the duration of the movie.
user1: Did critics like it?

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: What sort of movies are you into? Do you like to laugh?
user2: yeah i do
user1: Have you seen Bruce Almighty yet?
user2: no
user2: is it good
user1: Without a doubt - it even has funny guy Jim Carey.
user2: that's cool
user2: how was the critcs on this one
user1: Not so great, only about 4-5/10. 
user2: wow
user2: but that does not effect most people views
user1: You're right - I don't think most people care about that sort of thing. Do you?
user2: not really 
user2: a good movie can be found anywhere
user1: Me either. Do you know what Bruce Almighty is about at all?
user2: not really
user2: can you tell me
user1: I'd agree with that as well about the finding a gem anywhere. Basically Jim Carey plays a news anchorman who is down on his luck..
user2: ok
user1: He's married, but he has a crush on a gal in his office, and his rival is causing serious problems as well.
user2: sounds like it could be funny
user1: He then gets powers from God, and sets up an email system!
user2: lol
user2: sounds silly
user1: Can you imagine god emailing folks? LOL.
user2: yeah that sounds crazy
user2: i might have to see this movie
user2: any other thing about the movie
user1: Oh, he also finds the body of Jimmy Hoffa, LOL.
user2: lol what that seems too much
user1: At the end, a homeless man reveals himself to be god. 
user2: lol
user2: that is too much
user1: I think the homeless guy turning out to be god was a unique twist.
user2: yes it seems that way
user1: Guess I never gotta see that one, LOL. 
user2: lol thanks
user2: have a good day

conversation:
user1: Hi, How are you?
user2: I'm good! How about you?
user1: Doing great, what did you think about Bruce Almighty?
user2: I thought it was a great movie! I don't understand why it only got a 46% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Honestly, I think Rotten Tomatoes is really biased against certain movies.
user1: It doesn't surprise me they rated it so low.
user1: I mean Jim Carry was banned from Egypt because of the film.
user2: That's strange. It's clearly a comedy and Jim Carrey is known for comedy.
user1: Yes, but people are very uptight about religion.
user1: I think if the movie was released in our current time , it would of been boycotted
user1: I personally would rate the film a solid 8, what about you?
user2: I'd probably also give the film an 8/10. It has a lot of replay value, and the jokes have not soured over time.
user2: Who do you think was a better actor in the movie, Jim Carrey or Morgan Freeman?
user1: That is a really tough question, because I really liked both of their performances. 
user1: They were really both convincing, but if I had to pick I'd say Jimm won by a small margrine
user2: As much as I like Jim, I think another comedian could have done an equally good job. Morgan has since been defined by his role of god, since his voice is very fitting.
user2: What did you think of Jennifer Aniston as the girlfriend?
user1: Morgan's voice will always be iconic. The guy could literally narrate what we are doing now and it would sound fantastic.
user1: She was pretty forgettable actually. I was so focused on Jim, Morgan and the story that I often forgot about her. How about you?
user2: I felt like she wasn't terribly believable, especially since Bruce/Jim seemed interested in Susan. Jennifer is not someone to be turned down.
user2: That meteor scene was pretty hilarious though, with the cook off nearby.
user1: Yeah, sometimes I wonder how she gets the roles she does.
user1: Lol, yeah I really liked he meteor scene
user2: Which "miracle" did you like the best?
user1: I also liked when Jim first discovered his powers.
user1: I'd say scene wish I liked it when Bruce was messing with Evan during the news broadcast.
user1: I literally lose it every time I see that scene
user2: Me too!
user2: Steve does such a great job pretending to be controlled.
user1: I also like when they first met, there was a lot of meaning behind it even though the movie was a comedy.
user1: Lol, yeah Steve Correl is great.
user1: I wish he has a bigger role in the film.
user2: I think he and Jim could have switched roles and the movie would have still been great.
user2: Did you think that Grace should have reconciled with Bruce?
user2: Because I definitely don't.
user1: I can agree with that. They both have similar comedy styles, although I think Steve does a bit more reality based comedy.
user1: From a story perspective yes, but from real-world perspective no.
user1: I'd say overall the movie is a solid watch and will be a classic
user1: Thanks for chatting with me friend. It was a lot of fun!
user2: I agree, regardless of critic ratings. It was nice chatting with you too!
user1: Have a good one!

conversation:
user2: hello, how are you
user1: Hi there! Very well. How about you?
user1: Have you ever seen Bruce Almighty?
user2: I have heard of Bruce Almighty, but I haven't seen it. whats it about again?
user1: It's a funny comedy movie.
user1: There's a guy who complains to God and he gets to do God's job for a week.
user2: I like comedies. who stars in it?
user1: Jim Carrey plays the lead, so you know it's hilarious.
user1: Morgan Freeman makes a great God in the movie too.
user2: oh man. Jim Carrey can be really crazy once he gets going. 
user1: Oh yes. There were some parts I couldn't stop laughing at.
user1: It's from 2003
user2: haha. I was just about to ask you when it came out. how have I not seen this yet.
user1: He starts out as a tv reporter, so combine that role with Carrey's personality
user2: I could see him being an over the top anchor
user1: He gets really upset when he doesn't get a promotion and completely loses it
user1: Especially when the person who did get promoted steals one of his dialogues
user2: is it a family friendly film?
user1: Some parts are a little rough for language, depending on age
user1: But I'd say it's pretty funny for everyone
user2: Thats ok. I like it when they are bit irreverant.
user1: Oh yes
user1: Once he gets God powers he does ridiculous things
user1: He makes the guy who got promoted over him completely embarrass himself
user2: I'm already imagining some of the facial expressions he must make.
user1: They're great in everything he does
user1: Then he starts answering yes to everyone asking god for things
user2: I'm sure that leads to some crazy situations. giving everyone everything they want isn't always the best.
user2: what did the critics think?
user1: Yea not a great idea, but he thought he was saving time and making people happy
user1: The CinemaScore was an A
user1: It was kind of in the middle on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: do you think I should check it out? those scores don't sound bad.
user1: I think it was really fun and amusing
user1: If you like Carrey and comedies you'd probably enjoy it
user2: I'm interested. I think I would enjoy it.
user1: It has a happy ending too after the main character stops having those god powers
user1: He has a kind of realization and it changes him for the better
user2: That sounds a little deeper than I thought. Is there any villain in the story?
user1: Not really. The other tv person is a rival, but he's not really bad.
user2: ok. I think I'll check it out when I get the chance. Thanks for explaining it!
user1: Have fun! Thanks for chatting

user1: Hello!
user1: Have you ever seen the movie Bruce Almighty?
user2: Hello, What movie do you want to talk about?
user1: Bruce Almighty
user2: Yes I have seen that movie

conversation:
user1: Hello! How are you? What movie are we discussing today?
user2: Bruce Almighty
user1: Interesting. What is the movie about? Who is in the movie?
user2: The movie is about a news reporter that hopes to become an anchor. Jim Carey is one of the actors in the movie. 
user1: Sounds cool. I like Jim Carrey. So I guess this is a comedy? 
user1: Who else is in the movie apart from Jim Carrey?
user2: It is a comedy. You also have Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston in the movie too!
user1: Nice. I like Freeman and Anniston too. What do they play in the movie? 
user2: Morgan Freeman plays God and Jennifer Anniston plays a woman named Grace Connelly.
user1: Oh wow. Morgan Freeman is God? Sounds fun. By the way who is Bruce and why is he Almighty as the title suggests?
user2: Yes, he plays God but only to give Bruce a chance to play God himself. That's where the Almighty in 'Bruce Almighty' comes from. 
user1: Could you remind me who Bruce? Is he the reporter played by Jim Carrey? That sounds even funnier!
user1: Tell me more about the movie. What happens in the movie when Bruce plays God?

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: HI
user1: Did the document you read a movie that you have seen?
user1: sorry Was the document?
user2: no
user1: did the movie sound interesting?
user2: yes
user1: was it a drama?
user2: yes
user1: were there any famous actors in it?
user2: none that i remember of 
user1: was is a movie made recently
user2: yes
user1: did it come out in the theater? or was it a Netflix/Amazon type movie
user2: don't remember really 
user1: what was the movie about
user2: don't remember really 
user1: what was the name of the movie
user2: don't remember really 
user1: you don't remember but it is something you would watch?
user2: yes absolutely, looked interesting 
user1: so what was your interest in the movie?
user2: drama
user1: are drama's the only one;s you like
user2: no
user1: so what was it about the drama that made you want to see the movie
user2: everything! 
user1: such as
user1: describe the movie to me 
user2: the whole movie??
user1: no just what made you interested in seeing it
user1: if it is interesting i might want to watch it as well, if you could remember the name it would be helpful for me. 
user2: I think the movie is about How God makes a visit to some human who has lost faith to restore it, something like bruce almighty is the title
user1: Bruce Almighty was actually a movie that came out years ago it was very funny not a drama at all.
user2: really? i like all the drama of how God comes to earth I don't think there is anything funny about that, maybe my sense of humor needs some god

conversation:
user2: I really enjoyed that movie, I loved Jim Carrey's role as Bruce, it was hilarious!
user1: Jim Carrey pulls off comedy very well
user2: I completely agree, it suits him! Would you watch this movie again?
user1: No, once is enough for me, it was good for a night
user1: how about you?
user2: I can see that, once you watch a comedy once, you don't really want to watch it again! I want to watch more Jim Carrey movies though, forsure!
user1: Morgan Freeman does good serious as well as comedy
user2: Oh I completely agree, Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of all time! I can see that Bruce Almighty wasn't ranked that well on Rotten Tomatoes, I guess not many people enjoyed it.
user1: Sites like Rotten Tomatoes create or kill the buzz around a movie
user2: So true, Their scoring amuses me sometimes, sometimes they seem completely wrong. Anyways, This movie is pretty old now, but I still hear people talking about it, I wouldn't call it a classic, but it's a quality movie for sure!
user2: That was a very funny scene, I love the drama of Jim falling in love with 2 women. It creates so much drama
user1: Yes, we need a male versus female tension in a good movie
user1: 2 women is even better
user2: I agree. I often feel bad for Jim in this movie, yet I shouldn't. He's always having bad luck in the film. Especially when Evan Baxter wins the promotion over him.
user1: That's what make for the plot, wouldn't need to take God to task, otherwise.
user2: Exactly! Bruce is hilarious though. I love how he is googly eyes over Susan, and she doesn't even notice him LOL
user1: Bruce has a good frustrated look, he play it well.
user2: Haha I love this scene, when Bruce is hearing voices from god in his dead. Trying to make everyone happy!
user1: Us mortals need to have experiences like this to empathize with God...
user2: Yup! I love how he automatically answers every prayer with yes! Now he's really in a pickle
user1: Some things prayed for aren't always "Godly"; this make for humor
user2: I agree! I love when Bruce humiliates Evan on air, then Evan got fired! I laughed so hard at that part. I really didn't like Evan!
user2: I love when God apprears!
user1: He was made for us to hate, the perfect anti-hero, and foil.
user2: When Bruce woke up in the hospital, I was so confused at first!
user1: Lost me too for a little while, keep the audience off balance
user2: Yeah! Man though, when the homeless man showed up at the end holding the sign though! I laughed pretty hard at that!
user1: The perfect ending, a homeless man, with a sign..I laughed too.
user2: It was pretty great! I loved Bruce in this movie, I don't think that they could have picked a better actor
user1: Might see it again sometime.
user2: Might join you on that, haha!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello
user2: Do you know what is the name of the movie?
user1: Yes, the movie is Bruce Almighty. Have you seen it?
user2: Not yet. What is it about?
user1: It is a comedy that has Jim Carrey as the main character. He is a TV reporter and complains to God (played by Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly, so Freeman gives his job of playing God to Carrey.
user1: It was rated a 5.7/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: It also has Jennifer Aniston as well. 
user2: I like Jim Carrey, I think he is funny. But the ratings is not so good. What do you think about the movie?
user1: It has some funny parts, not all of it is funny.
user2: any good moments in the movie?
user1: Carrey gets carried away with spoiling himself and forgets that there's a lot of people that ned help.
user1: A new document popped up on my side, but it is blank. 
user1: Weird?
user2: hmm i don't have a document. Is it a family movie? I mean can I watch with my kids?
user1: I guess it depends on your kid's ages.
user2: 4 and 7?
user1: Like, in one scene, he decides to change his girlfriend's boob sizes to be bigger.
user1: I don't know if that is quite appropriate
user1: He also uses his powers as God to blow a girls skirt up.
user1: I can't think of any other inappropriate/sexual things in it.
user1: It is just a slap-stick comedy for sure.
user2: ah ok probably not a good idea to watch it with kids. 
user2: I guess its a religious movie? since it is about God?
user1: Not really, just basically like, His job is hard.
user1: Like, at one scene, Carrey keeps hearing voices.
user1: And it is explained that he hasn't been answering prayers.
user1: So he instead organizes these requests by sorting them into an email.
user1: So he starts answering them, and gets  a bit overwhelmed.
user1: So then he just replies "yes" to everyone.
user1: So then a bunch of people win the lottery at the same time.
user2: He hasn't been answering prayers? God or Carrey?
user1: Carrey
user1: He was just playing with the new given powers.
user2: Interesting. 
user1: Like, blowing up a girl's skirt or pulling the moon closer to impress his girlfriend.
user2: Is Jennifer his girlfriend in the movie?
user1: In another key scene, God appears and tells Bruce (Carrey) to pray what he truly wants. And he prays for Jennifer (yes, his girlfriend) to find a man that would make her happy.
user1: They end up getting engaged on tv (since hes a reporter).
user1: While there are funny parts, the movie brings a lot of other issues to light. You can't just do what you want, or tell everyone yes to their prayers, there are consequences for everything.
user2: what year it was released?
user1: 2003
user2: wow it is an old movie
user1: I haven't heard of CinemaScore, but they rated the movie an A
user1: Metracritic Score is 46/100
user1: It is something to kind of put on in the background and laugh at here and there.
user2: Nice. I will search to see if I can watch it on prime. Thank you!

conversation:
user1: Hey everyong 
user1: have you all had a chance to review the document 
user2: Interesting it got A on Cinemascore but 48$ rotten tomatoes
user2: i did, seems lilke it could be funny
user1: Yeah I agree with that 
user1: The cast seemed good, I would have thought it was pretty funny with Jim Carey 
user2: Good actor, wide range of emotional characters he plays
user2: Sounds like he might learn a lesson by acquiring god powers
user1: Has anyone seen the movie, if so did they like it? I remember seeing previews but I don't think I would have liked the movie myself
user2: It was decent, I recall seeing it...probably 8-10 years ago
user2: Especially if you're a Jim Carrey fan, I'd watch it. 
user1: I would agree with that 
user2: Did you like other Carrey movies?
user1: Funny that jim carey and jennifer aniston of all people are in a relationship for a movie, I bet that was interesting 
user2: I suppose
user1: I bet the showdown on air between jim carey and steve carrell was pretty funny 
user1: Carey
user2: Morgan Freeman was also good as the god character
user2: yea Jim Carrey
user2: There is a morale to the story about wanting power etc
user1: Using the powers for good and bad must have been a good twist 
user2: Yea, it was
user1: lol and email system to respond to prayers thats hilarious 
user2: The scenes with him on email answering prayers is very funny
user1: I bet 
user1: it sounds like it 
user2: I forgot Steve Carrell was in it too
user2: the cast is highly talented
user1: I wonder why he wanted to get Grace a new man?
user2: For her happiness
user2: Cause he was too consumed with his own power
user1: It seemed like she wanted to be with him if they reconcilled after he was in the hospital 
user2: I'm not positie how it ended
user1: looks like it was with a homeless man holding up a sign stating that he was god 
user1: I'm not clear if he was telling this this to Jim Carey or if he was saying that he himself was god 
user1: Are you still there?
user1: How am I supposed to finish this task of the other person left?

conversation:
user1: Hi there! Have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user2: Hi, I Have seen Bruce Almighty. I thought it was a funny movie.
user1: Oh cool. I haven't seen it. Although, somehow Morgan Freeman as God seems to make sense. Lol
user2: Morgan Freeman has such a great voice. I also love Jim Carrey.
user1: I do really adore Jim Carrey. I'm not sure why I didn't see this movie. 
user1: And yes, Morgan Freeman's voice is amazing. 
user2: Jennifer Aniston is great too.
user1: She is. I like her a lot. 
user1: I was just seeing though, the Rotten tomatoes score is only 48%, but CinemaScore gave it an A? That seems vastly different. 
user2: I'm wondering if the CinemaScore is more a user review and Rotton is based on the critics.
user2: It looks like the critical response was bad.
user1: It's possible. I don't know much about either platform. And yes, looking at the comments from critics it didn't seem popular. But, I'm not sure comedies ever really are. 
user2: My favorite part of the movie is that it has Steve Carell in it.
user1: Oh awesome! I love him. 
user2: yes, he plays Evan Baxter in this movie
user1: It's been... 15 years since this was released? Ouch. I'm old. 
user2: I know. 2003 doesn't even seem that long ago
user1: It doesn't. Was Jennifer Aniston good?
user2: Yeah, I think she did pretty well in this movie. It's amazing to think that she was young in this movie too.
user1: Crazy to think about for sure. Lol. Evan sounds like not a great guy based on this. 
user2: Evan and Bruce have some conflict in this movie for sure, but I think they see past it at the end
user1: It's hard for me to imagine Steve Carell in another type of role because I loved him in The Office. Do you think his character is different in this film?
user2: It's a more serious character for sure. 
user2: I love his character in the Office. He's a good comedic actor.
user1: He is. Lol, wait... Bruce discovers the body of Jimmy Hoffa??
user2: ya Bruce is able to make things turn out perfectly for him to get the best storires on his news show
user1: Wow. I feel like I would've laughed at that. It says he prays and then ends up in the hospital. Does the movie show what happens to get him in the hospital?
user2: I honestly don't remember. I think maybe he gets hit by a car.
user2: But survies and everything is all good. lol
user1: Interesting. I was just curious. What does the sign say at the end?
user2: It's been a while since I've seen the movie to remember that detail
user1: Well I also misread. I thought the sign just had one message on there but it looks like maybe there were several. 
user2: but the homeless man turns out to be God, AKA Morgan Freeman
user1: And somehow that makes complete sense. Morgan Freeman sort of seems like he could just suddenly be like, "Fooled you!"
user2: ya, he makes a good God charactor

conversation:
user1: hi how are you?
user2: hello! I am good, and you?
user1: gooood!
user1: do you like movies?
user1: have you seen Bruce Almighty before?
user2: I have! who was your favorite actor in it?
user1: morgan freeman
user2: I liked Jim Carrey.
user1: i love his characted - his voice
user2: his voice is good
user1: yeahhhh
user2: 2003 long time ago..wow
user1: yeahhh
user1: did you like the movie?
user2: I forgot Jennifer Anisoton was in it too. 
user2: It is funny. what did you think?
user1: yeahhh she was really great - although i feel like a lot of her roles are very similar
user1: i liked it alot
user2: got a 5.7/10 rotten tomatoes score
user1: yeah.. but rotten tomatoes is always such a difficult critic
user1: i love when comedies are able to display a deeper context.. 
user2: I like how Bruce used his powers in the movie. 
user1: similar to Big Daddy
user1: yeahhh
user1: to get back at those gangsters lol 
user2: Tom Shadyac is the director. 
user1: and i loved the scene where he pulled in the moon
user2: and the news reporters..
user1: yeahhh
user1: hilarioius
user1: what was your least favorite part of the movie?
user2: hilarious in the slapstick scenes
user2: Carrey takes himself a bit seriously for being such a goof
user1: yeahhh
user1: thats very true
user1: i didn't like that he was kind of selfish... 
user1: but in general i really loved the movie
user2: me too
user1: ohhhh! and i forgot that he flirted with the other reporter sometimes...
user1: actually he doesn't portray such a great person ... 
user2: not so much
user1: kinds of treats jennifer aniston badly...
user1: selfish career-wise
user1: but then she took him back in the end anyways
user1: morgan freeman really made the movie though.. 
user1: i feel like that role paved the way for him doing all these voiceovers
user2: guess they were in love
user1: yeahhh
user2: good comedy
user1: very good
user1: nice and simple plot line
user1: very relateable
user2: easy watch if you want a mindless movie. sometimes that is good
user1: yesssss
user1: to have it playing in the background
user2: relateable, ok
user1: yesss
user2: I think i will watch it this weekend
user1: yeahhh i would too
user2: I will watch God appear to Bruce ..
user1: and i felt that the scene where morgan freeman was just mopping was very soothing
user1: loll yeah

user2: BRUCE ALMIGHTY
user2: ITS A GOOD MOVIE ITS REAL FUNNY
user2: HAVE YOU SEEN IT
user2: WOULDNT YOU LOVE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF POWER
user1: Nope, but I like funny movies

conversation:
user2: Have you seen the movie Bruce Almighty before?
user1: Hello there, did you like Bruce Almighty? Who was your favorite character?
user1: Yes, it was hilarious
user2: Yes. I did like the movie. I like Jim Carrey. He always has some funny roles.
user1: Yes, he does. Wasn't Steve Carrell in this movie also?
user2: I thought he was really good in his role as a news reporter in this movie.
user2: Who was your favorite character in the movie?
user1: He was really complaining in this movie-I guess he got what he was looking for
user1: Mine was Morgan Freeman's role as God
user2: Yes. He is one of my favorite actors also. He always plays such strong character roles.
user1: Evan Baxter was a jerk though. He added fuel to the fire
user2: Yes he did. I think Jennifer Aniston played the role as the girlfriend really good.
user1: Yes she did, but she kind of made me mad in how she didn't support Bruce
user2: I know. I felt bad that he had such a hard time of it through the movie. He always seemed to be plagued by bad luck.
user1: One of the funniest parts was when he encountered the group of guys in the alley
user2: Yes. I also like the part where he had the crush on his co-worker but she didn't pay any attention to him.
user1: It was hilarious when he told WKBW to shove it. He had to know that he would be fired
user1: And on live TV, no less
user2: I know. I thought it was so funny when he used his powers to cause Evan to be fired.
user1: I wish I could type as fast as Bruce did when answering those emails!
user2: I know it. Can you imagine trying to answer everyone's prayers by e-mail. That would be impossible, as I'm sure he found out.
user1: Yes, and deciding who to say yes to, and who to reject. That dog of his had a potty problem didn't he? 
user1: Can you imagine how disturbing to have voices in your head suddenly?
user2: I think he just told everyone yes, to make everyone happy. Don't you know that Grace was so disappointed when he didn't propose to her when they went out to eat.
user1: I would have been as well, but I guess if you don't have expectations you can't be disappointed
user1: She finally got her wish, though. On live TV
user2: That's true. I really liked the part where God told Bruce to pray for what he really wanted. And he prays for Grace to find a man that would make her happy. That was a touching scene.
user1: Very touching indeed. As was the ending scene with Morgan Freeman holding the sign. That was a good movie for it's time
user2: Yes it was. It's hard to believe that it came out in 2003. I have watched it several times since then, and it's always enjoyable.
user1: The ratings don't seem right though, I would give it at least 7/10
user2: I know. I would too. That's one reason I am not a big fan of the Rotten Tomatoes rating system. They are not very accurate at times.

conversation:
user1: Hello, what movie did you read about?

conversation:
user1: The film, Bruce Almighty featuring Jim Carrey, performed great with CinemaScore (it got an A). It was hilarious with many slapstick scenes and is one of the best films by Jim Carrey.
user1: I really think it's great, it came out in 2003 and was directed by Tom Shadyac. It even has Morgan Freeman playing God!
user2: JIM CAREY IS FUNNY
user2: morgan freeman as well
user2: any critic reviews?
user1: Yeah, they thought Carrey was hilarious and that it was one of his best films!
user1: And the Cinema Score was an A
user2: really, wow thats a good strong opinion
user2: awesome.  any good twists noted
user1: I think so too! In it the main character, Bruce, played by Jim Carrey, gets to play God for a week!
user2: bet that was hilarious
user2: was there a rotten tomato score
user1: There was 48% but the average score was 5.7/10
user2: thats surprising
user1: Yeah, but it's so funny, since Bruce is a reporter, they shoot an entire scene where he just gets hit with a ton of bad luck and it's aired on TV!
user2: haha, sounds like my kind of movie
user1: Yeah it even has Steve Carell who steals a promotion out from under Jim Carrey's character!
user2: three great actors, I should probably check this film out sometime
user1: Yeah, you totally should!
user2: does steve carell have a big role?
user1: He plays Bruce's rival and when Bruce gets his God powers, he makes Evan (Steve Carell's character) make a fool of himsel fon tv!
user2: interesting
user2: I bet they work well together, both funny goofy guys
user1: Yeah totally! When Steve Carell's character is on screen it's hilarious! He gets fired for messing up so badly!
user2: nice
user2: where does it take place, or no mention?
user1: Buffalo, New York!
user2: thats different, pretty cool
user2: any dramatic ending?
user1: Yeah a fun choice for sure! In the end Bruce kind of changes his ways! He takes more pleasure in his job and sees how important his girlfriend was.
user2: always a love story
user2: every movie lol
user1: Of course! 
user1: Haha
user2: so yeah, think I'd like to watch this one

conversation:
user1: How did you like the movie?
user2: Its great, it has so many big stars in it!
user2: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston.
user1: I know! I can't believe they were able to get so many good actors
user1: Does Carrey play a serious or a funny character? 
user2: Yeah I know, this is known as one of Jim Carrey's best movies!
user2: He plays a funny character, with some minor serious times.
user1: I really enjoy the depth of his characters! And Morgan Freeman? He's great in everything.
user2: Morgan Freeman is great! I really do love the comedy in this movie.
user1: Does Freeman have to pull off a funny character?
user2: He is more serious, but still great!
user1: I think his God voice is spot on. 
user2: I cannot believe this was made in 2003, it seems like yesterday!
user2: The voice is great, Morgan Freeman has a classic voice!
user1: I know! and to think I wasn't even in high school yet! And I can still re-watch and laugh out loud. Lassoing the moon is a nice move. 
user2: Oh geez, Im old I was 23! I dont remember Steve Carrell in this, but I see he was.
user1: He worked with him! I really like Carrell in Anchorman! I forgot he had such a small role in this movie
user2: Yeah, I didnt realize. This got really good reviews from critics, which isnt always the case with comedies, I wish they made more like this.
user1: I wonder how intense it would be to hear prayers in your ears at all times like Carrey has to in the movie.
user2: That would be crazy weird, Im not so sure I could handle that.
user1: And, rotten tomatoes gives it a 49% but I think they miss the mark on a lot of things.
user2: I dont really understand the whole rotten tomato score. It doesnt make sense to me.
user1: Did you think it was funny when Bruce uses his powers to make his girlfriends chest a *bit* bigger. As a woman, I laughed pretty hard. 
user1: I totally agree about Rotten Tomatoes. They seem really bias, but in a way I don't understand 
user2: Yes, that was hillarious!
user1: I honestly think I might watch this again tonight. 
user1: It's been years.
user2: I like how he creates an email system to receive prayers, haha!
user1: But doesn't his email go insane?! Way worse than work emails. 
user2: yeah really!

conversation:
user1: this is a timeless classic in my opnion
user2: Yes, it is one of Carrey's best roles.
user1: i dont get the last comment oh his acting hes amazing
user2: Yes, he is very funny and good at physical humor, slapstick.
user2: How many films has Morgan played God?
user1: The Rotten Tamatoes score is awful it kind of makes me lose faith in it
user2: He is the voice of God to me.
user1: idk thats a great question
user2: I never trust Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Ive never really looked
user2: Never get into a work relationship, right?
user1: Always dangerous territory
user1: Has such a great cast
user2: Steve Carell was amazing. 
user2: That scene where he is babbling was hilarious.
user1: Hes so incredibly talented
user1: Such a great plot. How many times has everyone imagined themselves being god
user2: And trying to answer the prayers.
user1: Shows how hard it is really
user2: Brings a human aspect to God
user2: You can't please them all though.
user1: Maybe the message was be nicer to god
user1: He abused his powers to be with the girl he loved feels like cheating
user2: Just be happy with what you have.
user2: But you dont always get a happy ending.
user1: the happy ending is realizing you were happy the whole time
user2: I want to watch this now.
user1: haha its been too long
user2: I forget what happens to Steve Carell. He probably got the anchor job.
user1: I think so
user2: Still boggle over the cinema score vs rotten tomato. Funny movie.
user1: I like how the homeless guy had the signs
user1: yea its embarrasing to them
user2: WOnder what God did during his week off

user1: yes i have
user2: What did you think of Jim Carrey's acting in this movie?
user1: it is a very funny moive
user1: I think it is one of his best
user2: yes it was, Morgan Freeman was a great touch as God
user1: love his over the top motion 
user2: very underated movie
user1: yes just as good as Carrey
user1: Yea i would agree
user2: can't believe it came out so long ago
user1: yea but still a classic
user2: we haven't seen a new movie from him in awhile of this caliber
user1: plus it showed a good message
user2: what was the message you got from it?
user1: that we can'
user1: can'
user1: can't just get what we want
user2: that is true, there is always a consequence
user1: we have to work for it 
user2: yes, but potrayed in a light hearted way
user1: like the part where everyone got the winning lottery numbers and they only won 4 dollars 
user2: yes that was a great jab
user1: I also like how he was sweeping showing to me how me was cleaning up other messes
user2: yea, he was trying to do a lot to
user2: make others feel better or make life better
user1: yes and at the end how he realized that even though he did not get his wish but others are happy
user2: yea - trying to help too many people and thinking it's never enough
user1: we can't ever do enough but we can only do what we do 
user2: yep, that was a good message from the movie
user1: yes i agree

user2: the movie we are discussing is called bruce almighty
user2: seen it before?
user1: Yes, I have actually
user1: Have you? 
user2: no
user2: it has such a low rating
user2: 5.7/10
user1: Yes it does, not one of my favorites.
user2: thing i love about jim is that he perseve
user2: there was a time he was paid very little
user2: today he is expensive
user1: Very true 
user1: Are you familiar with the ret
user1: Rest of the cast 
user2: no
user2: oh i have the document if thats wat u mean
user2: director is tom shady
user2: never heard of him
user2: *shadyac
user1: I'm sorry, I meant the other cast members 
user1: Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston etc. 
user2: yea...morgan freeman as god
user2: now i remember d movie
user2: lol
user2: he built an arc
user1: lol 
user2: he was a senator
user1: Yep, that's the one 
user2: :)
user1: Do you think it was funny? 
user2: i wish that happens in real life where God warns of an impendending danger directly, of course its funny
user1: Yeah, that would be nice 
user2: our chat ended, nice talking to u buddy
user1: Same here 
user2: lets claim our money
user2: haha
user1: Lol 
user1: Hello 

conversation:
user1: The RT score does not surprise me. 
user2: Did you think it should be higher or lower?
user1: I think it's about right. The movie isn't terrible but also isn't amazing. 
user2: I thought it should be higher, I really enjoyed it
user1: I'm not a fan of Jen Aniston. Jim Carrey is okay. 
user1: I agree with the critic calling it treacly. The sweet gets too sweet and is then just gross and heavy handed. 
user2: I like Jim Carrey, but Morgan Freeman was who really won me over
user1: He is consistently a pleasure to watch. 
user2: Do you normally watch comedy movies, or do you typically go for a different genre?
user1: My favorite genre is horror, but comedy is a close second. 
user2: Comedy is my favorite, so maybe that is why I liked it more.
user1: Possibly. 
user1: I loved Steve Carell in this. 
user1: Even if Evan was supposed to be an antagonist,i couldnt help but like him
user2: I was caught off guard when he stole the dialogue, but he played his part well
user1: He has good range. 
user2: What did you think about Lisa Ann Walter?
user1: Not much depth, she was the sister who didn't like Bruce, right?
user2: I believe so, she was Debbie Connelly
user1: Jen Aniston plays the same girlfriend in every film. Always expecting a selfish lout to suddenly make a romantic gesture, like he's going to do a 180 overnight and be who she thinks she deserves
user1: When her total effort in the relationship is to call him 'hun' a lot and whine to a sister or friend
user2: I don't really blame her for thinking he was going to propose though, I might have thought the same thing if I were her
user1: She should have known better given what we see of him. 
user2: I thought it was funny that he created an email for they prayers. It was a creative idea.
user1: And a good plug for Yahoo, lol
user2: I couldn't imagine if I got a yes to all of my prayers, that would be great
user1: Yeah, but everyone getting a yes turned into chaos pretty quickly
user2: Im sure that is what would really happen, but its still a fun thought
user1: My favorite part of the end was the signs, literal signs he sees, before getting hit by a car
user2: I thought it was a really creative idea that the director did well
user1: The prayer beads in his hand was a step too far in the treacly direction, though, returning to that idea
user2: I would agree with that. What did you think about Bruce praying for Grace to find a man to make her happy?
user1: That was him illustrating that he finally Got It and was less of an ass.

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: Hi do you like jam carrey ?

user2: I know, I read the instructions too.
user1: it came out in 2003 so you can probably get it on dvd by now
user2: I want some more reasons to watch the movie, thats what I am telling you because I feel like I watched the movie a lot of times.
user2: DVD?
user2: What's that?!
user1: physical media unless you have cable its on cable all the time , Please look thru tv guide book and you might find the showing times
user1: i can link you to get the tv guide subscription book

user2: Have you seen any lately?
user1: yeah i've actually seen the movie in the document.
user1: Have you seen bruce almighty
user1: ?
user2: No, I haven't seen that one yet.  Is it good?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!
user2: Have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: No I havent. What is that movie about?
user1: What year did the movie comeo ut?
user2: Its a comedy film about a TV reporter who complains to god and then he gets a chance to be God himself for a week
user2: Its a 2003 film
user1: That sounds pretty good...who plays in it?
user2: The lead actor is Jim Carrey
user2: he acts as Bruce Nolan
user1: Who is the director for this movie?
user2: The director is Tom Shadyac
user1: Could you tell me what your favorite scene of the movie is?
user2: My favorite scene is when Bruce suffers from constant bad luck 
user2: It was a pretty fun scene
user2: theres a lot of comedy in it
user1: It definitly sounds like it!
user1: How are the ratings on this movie?
user2: The ratings arent that good actually
user2: it has a 5.7 out of 10 Rotten tomatoes rating
user1: Oh no! Well sometimes ratings dont mean very much
user2: a Metacritic Score of 46/100
user2: and yeah I agree
user1: Any other famous actors in this movie?
user2: There are a few actually
user2: Morgan Freeman is God
user1: Hes an amazing actor!
user2: and Jennifer Aniston is one of the actress as well
user2: I love how Morgan Freeman acts, his the best
user1: Wow! I wonder why they got such poor reviews with such awesome actors/actresses.
user1: Yes, hes always been my favorite actor of all time!
user1: Any other good scenes that you like?

conversation:
user1: Do you like comedies?
user2: Yes, I love comedies.  And Morgan Freeman is a very good actor.
user1: Yes, he has acted in a lot of movies
user2: I thought it was a funny movie.  Jim Carrey is always funny.
user1: Yes, he is
user1: He is the modern day Charlie Chaplain, with all his slapstick antics
user2: I agree.  I can see him as being a down-on-his-luck TV reporter.
user1: It also have a religious twist in the movie Bruce Almighty, but nothing too heavy
user1: Just enough to make it a movie with a moral
user1: at the end
user2: Yes. He is also seen as too comedic by his fellow workers.  But all in all it is a funny comedy.
user1: I do not know why the critics gave it such a low score
user2: I really don't rely on critics much, everyone has different opinions and Bruce Almighty, even though it was produced in 2003 is still to this day a funny movie.
user1: I agree.  Jim Carrey is just in a class by himself.
user2: And Jennifer Aniston is one of the best actresses I have seen.  She played the role of Grace Connelly very well.
user1: Yes, they make a very good team
user2: I can just see Jim Carrey getting passed over in the movie for the promotion by his rivalry.
user2: Tom Shadyac knew just who to pick to star in this movie.
user1: it happens at time
user1: that is why it is considered Carey's best film
user2: I liked the way Bruce used the powers to cause miraculous events to happen just at the right time.
user1: Yes, it was really funny
user2: And when he discovered the body of Jimmy Hoffa, I busted out laughing.
user1: Yes, that was the funniest part for me too
user2: I could just imagine how Grace felt when she thought he was going to propose to her.
user1: Yeah, he was too caught up in himself to notice
user2: I bet when he prayed for Grace to find a man that would make her happy, that he never thought he would be that man.
user1: That's also happens in real life
user2: So true.  And I am sure a lot of reconciliations happen in the hospital, just like in the movie.
user2: I would freak out if I saw a man holding a sign like in the end of the movie and I had encountered what Bruce had.
user2: I could watch this movie over and over again.
user2: I liked the fact that he returned to work after all that happened.
user2: Would you watch the movie only based on the rating?

conversation:
user2: Do you like comdey movies?
user1: I do. I really love Bruce Almighty. I think it is one of Jim Carrey's better movies
user2: I agree, he was great as Bruce Nolan.
user1: I think Morgan Freeman made a great God. What do you think?

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello
user1: have you seen bruce almighty?
user2: have you seen the movie?
user2: Yes, I have!
user1: yes, been a while but i've seen it a few times
user1: i liked it
user2: so did I. I thought it was pretty funny!
user2: isn't there a second one?
user1: Me too! Jim Carrey does good in these movies
user1: I Wanna say Evan Almighty? but different guy in it
user2: he is hilarious!
user2: I think thats it. 
user1: I liked him in me myself and irene too! 
user2: omg yes haha hilarious movie!
user1: i can't believe this movie is already 15 years old tho
user2: I was just thinking that! 2003, that's crazy!
user1: morgan freeman did a good job as well, as always.
user2: and I'm surprised it was rated so low
user2: definitely 
user1: I did not remember jennifer aniston in it
user2: that was his girlfriend
user1: yeah that score sucks but rotten tomatoes and metacritic are like sooo hard on movies i think.
user2: I agree, especially rotten tomatoes
user1: She seems to play roles like that quite a bit- like in that one meet the millers movie i think it was called.
user2: Yes!! I've seen that movie so many times lol 
user2: she's gorgeous still for how old she is!
user1: I don't know the other names in this movie lisa or philip
user1: right, isn't she like 50?
user2: lisa was her sister in the movie
user2: i think so!
user1: I really feel like watching this movie again now!
user1: You have a great day! 
user2: same here haha is it on netflix
user2: you also!!
user1: i dont think it's on NF but i'm going to check hah!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hey
user2: Have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: I can't remember. Is that the one with Jim Carey?
user2: Yes, it was made in 2003.
user1: Cool, what was it about again?
user2: It had Carey as Bruce Nolan, a reporter that wanted to be a news anchor.
user1: No, I nevber saw it but I probably need to watch it? Did he ever get to be a news anchor?
user2: He complained to God that he was not doing his job correctly, so God let him be God for a week.
user1: Did he do anything spectactular when he was God?
user2: Yes but Bruce is always running into bad luck.
user1: Yeah, I am sure I never saw that movie. Do you know what kind of bad luck he had?
user2: He was reporting when his rival cut him off to accept his promotion on screen.
user1: That's funny.. So I guess he made himself an anchor?
user1: I mean, the other guy cut him off and accepted HIS promotion (sorry)
user2: You gotta see it, lots of slap stick comedy.
user2: The other guy got the promotion Carey was trying for.
user1: Yeah, I kinda like Jim Carey. (I like the movie with the "1 friggin eye")
user1: Yeah, but if Carey was GOD dor a week, couldn't he have done something about the promotion?
user2: He does a lot of things, his comedic personality probably was the reason he did not make anchor.
user1: I understand - (need to be straight faced for that job)
user1: I will catch the movie one day, what did the real God do at the end of the week? (Do you know?)
user2: Had personal problems 
user1: That's weird? GOD having personal problems...
user2: Morgan Freeman did a great job in the movie too.
user1: Was Morgan Freeman GOD or the guy that stole the promotion?
user2: Bruce makes great things happen at mundane events.
user1: Got an example?
user2: Freeman was God.
user1: Cool - Freeman being GOD
user2: Caused a meteor to land harmlessly by a BBQ cook off.
user1: The anchor that stole the job, do you know if it was a man or a woman?
user1: That's funny about the BBQ....
user2: A guy got the promotion.
user2: Bruce kept running into a homeless guy that turned out in the end, he was God.
user1: okay... Did Bruce ever get the promotion in the end?
user1: So, the homeless guy was Morgan Freeman in disguise?
user2: He set a program to say yes to all prayers. In the end he got the job.
user1: Good ending then for Bruce - Guess GOD had something to do with it?

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hi
user2: what movie will we talk about
user1: Bruce Almighty was a really funny movie.
user2: ok
user1: It featured Jim Carrey as the lead role
user2: cool
user1: It came out in 2003 and is described as a high-concept comedy.
user2: that sound cool
user1: Bruce Nolan (Carrey's character) complains to God that He isn't doing his job by not making him a new anchor.
user2: lol
user1: So God gave him the opportunity to be God for a week.
user2: ok that sounds like fun
user1: He gets passed over for the promotion by his rival Evan (played by Steve Carell).
user2: lol 
user1: Bruce himself is a field reporter and isn't seen by his coworkers as a potential anchor because he is too funny.
user2: ok 
user2: sounds good so far
user1: When Bruce is given the powers of God, he causes all kinds of hilarious things to happen that help him become anchor and Evan gets fired.
user1: It was really hilarious when he caused Evan (Steve Carell) to humiliate himself on air and lose his job.
user2: lol that seems useful
user1: He also had to answer people's prayers with Yes or No, there were a lot of prayers.  So he said "Yes" to everyone and the results were disastrous.
user2: thanks so far it seems like a movie i would watch
user1: Yeah, it's a good one.
user2: lol that all seems crazy
user2: how did the critics like it
user1: Morgan Freeman is God in the movie and he cleans everything up in the end.  Bruce lost his girlfriend because of being self absorbed, but he got her back at the end.
user1: Rotten Tomatoes 48% and average 5.7/10, Metacritic 46/100, CinemaScore: A
user2: of course i love how morgan freeman always seems to play the role of god
user2: thanks
user2: for the chat
user2: bye
user1: Yeah there's something about his height and voice.

conversation:
user1: Hi how are you? I think this movie "Bruce Almighty" sounds like an interesting movie. Do you like Jim Carrey?
user2: HI
user2: I am not familiar with Bruce Almighty. Can you tell me more about it?
user2: I do love Jim Carrey though.
user1: Sure.It was about this unhappy TV reporter who complains to God 
user2: That sounds like it would be entertaining. 
user1: Eventually he gets to play God for one week. The reporter is played by Jim Carrey and God by Morgan Freeman
user2: Do you know what year it came out? Im not sure how I missed it.
user1: It was over a decade ago. 2003. It has an okay score on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: I love Morgan Freeman too! He is such a good actor. Playing God sounds fun!
user1: haha yes I think he would fit in very well in his role right?
user2: Wow that has been out for a long time. I guess I need to look it up.
user2: What is Rotten Tomatoes?
user1: It is a movie aggregate ratings site. Anyways, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) has a complicated life. He is in a relationship with a girl played by Jennifer Aniston yet he has a crush on his co-worker.
user2: Yes actually Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman both have strong personalities so I can picture them both playing God. I think one would be very serious and the other would be a comical God though. haha
user2: Oh I really like Jennifer Aniston too. I can't imagine why he would be interested in someone else besides her.
user1: Oh yes. My thoughts so too. You know Steve Carell is in the movie. He is sort of Bruce's "rival"
user2: Do you mean Stever Carell from The Office?
user1: I don't know. This document doesn't say anything about The Office.
user2: If so I love him too. He cracks me up. I really enjoy his movies.
user2: Oh okay well if it is who I think it is then that is him.
user2: Jim Carrey and Steve Carell who be funny rivals against each other I think. 
user2: This movie is sounding better and better all the time.
user1: Well in the movie Bruce is now God and he wants to change his life. He wants to become the anchor at his news station by reporting a miraculous event.
user2: Oh I see. Why does he want to change his life?
user1: But on the other hand, God has responsibilities such as responding to people's prayers.
user1: As I told you earlier, he was unhappy with his life. His rival (Steve Carrell) had a promotion. He had a crush on his co-worker, etc.
user2: Well I'm sure God is very busy if he is listening and answering everybody's prayers all the time.
user2: So what kind of miraculous event does he want to occur?
user2: I can see why they would be rivals at work. Do they both like the same girl too?
user1: (slow down) A meteor striking the earth and he was the first reporter there to report it. etc.
user1: But at the end of the day, Bruce encounters God and Bruce tells God he wants his girlfriend to be happy
user2: Oh wow does the meteor actually strike earth or does he stop it from happening?
user1: He tells God that he just wants his girlfriend to be happy. He prays to him
user2: Does it explain why his girlfriend is unhappy?
user1: Nono. That probably means inside he is a human although he likes to play God
user2: So he prays to God even though he is God?
user1: Yes. He became God temporarily and he still is a human
user1: I think you will like this movie a lot
user1: Be sure to check it out!
user2: Okay I see. Well it sounds like I need to go rent the movie or see if I can find it on Netflix so I can find out the rest of the details for myself.
user1: It was nice talking to you. Good bye
user2: I definitely will.. Good bye

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: Hey, how are you doing today?
user2: I'm doing pretty good. Seems like we both get the documents this time.
user2: Have you seen Bruce Almighty before?
user1: Yes, we do. 
user1: Yeah I have what about you?
user2: I have. It's a pretty funny movie and I rather enjoyed it.
user1: The movie has a great cast of actors and actresses especially for that time.
user1: I enjoyed it quite a bit as well
user2: Yeah it had a real A-list of comedy actors and actresses. Morgan Freeman really stole the show in my opinion.
user1: Yeah I especially liked Morgan Freeman and Jim Carrey in the movie they both fit their respective roles well.
user2: I'm really surprised that it's not rated particularly well it seems.
user2: I guess it's just not one of those critic appeasing films.
user1: Yeah I know, when I saw the reviews I was very surprised. I thought it would be rated much higher but maybe in 2003 it was not so popular I can not recall
user2: I think it was one of those films that doesn't make huge waves but it is a decent film. I've definitely seen worse movies.
user1: Yeah I have as well. It is one of those comedies that serves its purpose. 
user2: Yeah, I guess it just didn't gel with critics. I enjoyed it though. Has that early 2000's lesson of learning to appreciate what you have.
user1: Yes that seems to be the message. 
user2: Jim Carrey is doing his typical delivery so maybe people were just a little tired of that at that point.
user1: I especially like when Bruce starts to have the encounters with god
user2: Yes. The interactions between Carrey and Freeman really carry the film.
user1: Yeah I still remember some of those iconic scenes and they still make me laugh.
user2: Freeman does a lot of subtlety as God and goes for more of a soft spoken performance that has a lot of wisdom behind it.
user1: Yeah a Carrey is more over the top and both of their styles together worked
user1: The relationship between Bruce and Grace was also an interesting story line
user2: Yeah, as it starts out Bruce is kind of shallow and doesn't really see what he has with her but he learns to appreciate what she means for him. 
user1: Yeah Morgan Freeman really helps him understand how important she is to his life.
user2: Plus I really love Jennifer Aniston as an actress.
user1: Yeah I have always liked her.
user1: I was just a big fan of this cast 
user2: Yeah, it's really shocking to me that it wasn't well received. But it is 2003. They didn't have the cinema train wrecks we have now for comparison.
user2: And I think we're done. Been nice talking with you
user1: That is very true
user2: Have a good day!
user1: Yeah you as well have a good one

conversation:
user1: What do you think of the concept?  God allowing a man to take the reins from him for a little while.  
user1: Jim Carrey was a divisive pick for the lead, I think. 
user2: almighty is a movie where the main actor did not believe in god and comes to give a lesson, I thought it was very good
user1: Did you find it more comical, or didactic, or both? 
user1: Did you consider it to be heretical at all? 
user2: It has a good concept because it mixes religion through comedy
user1: I thought that was a unique approach, too. 
user1: How do you account for its poor ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic? 
user2: Do you think it could happen in reality?
user1: No, not at all.  And that's what makes it a fun concept to explore.  
user1: God would never allow a man to have those kind of powers, and rightfully so.
user1: However, it makes a fun allegory.  
user2: It is inexplicable the low grades, it seems very good
user2: I think the same, god would not give power to a simple mortal, it is a lot of power
user1: Critical response is that its message gets "bogged down in treacle" - meaning cloying sentimentality. 
user1: I fear that's always a possibility with movies like this, but it wouldn't ruin the movie for me.  
user1: Even in the Bible, where God tests man, there is nothing comparable to him giving man such unbridled power.
user2: you would like an new version?
user1: I would be interested in reading the script, to see if it was worth making. 
user1: Definitely.
user2: If I would like a new version
user2: What other aspect of the movie did you like?
user1: I like Morgan Freeman as God.  
user2: the way God appears and keeps the mystery is very good
user2: a me too, is a good actor
user1: What do you think about the system Bruce sets up to "automatically answer every prayer"? 
user1: I think it's interesting, but flawed from the beginning.  
user2: it seems a little crazy
user2: I liked that the genre was comedy?
user1: I think it's a bad idea.  Giving people what they want won't necessarily make them happy.  
user1: I agree.  I think comedy was a good route to tackle these questions. 
user1: It seems that Bruce learns a moral lesson from the whole ordeal. 
user2: The main idea was to make people think that God exists and that it is always necessary to pray and ask in a good way
user1: I would agree that it should make people consider just how they ask their prayers.  
user2: Absolutely, I can learn the lesson
user1: And deep down, that allows them to really engage in some introspection.
user1: Which, I think, ultimately, is what God wants.
user1: More so than just asking him for prayers -- he wants to see us use the free will we were given, to create a better life.  
user2: I agree with your opinion
user1: Good chat. 

conversation:
user1: hello?

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi!
user1: Have you seen any good movies lately?
user2: Yes, I have actually. I was finally able to catch Black Panther recently. One of the best Marvel movies I have seen without a doubt.
user1: I just watched Bruce Almighty recently. It was actually pretty good
user2: Oh really? Was that one pretty good?
user1: I( think it was better then what the critics said. I love movies that make me laugh and it sure did
user1: How was black panther
user2: Black Panther was great. The storyline was amazing. It was well cast and the costumes etc were exactly as they should be. They really did a good job on it. 
user2: Jim Carrey is in Bruce Almighty correct?
user1: Yeah Jim Carrey, he is so funny
user1: It also has MOrgan Freeman, i love him
user2: Yes, he always makes me laugh. I remember seeing that Morgan Freeman is in it also. 
user1: critics only gave it a 5/10, but I think it was better then that
user2: I never really go by what the critics say. I have found them to be wrong at times. 
user2: Does Bruce Almighty teach some good lessons throughout the movie?
user1: Yeah, he teaches to let God handle life
user2: Oh okay. It sounds really good. I will have to check it out. 
user1: I love the fact my kids even my 2 year old can watch it
user2: That's great. It is always nice to be able to watch a movie with family. 
user1: Yeah, I hate having to worry about my kids walking in the room during a movie
user1: What type of movies do you like"?
user2: Yes, even with PG ratings it can sometimes be too racy. 
user2: I love horror movies. I am a sci-fi and comic book fan also. What about you?
user2: Who else stars in Bruce Almighty?
user2: I actually read the synopsis. How does Morgan Freeman do in the role of God in the movie?
user2: What would you say is the main point of the movie?

conversation:
user1: Hi! Do you think Bruce Almighty would be a good movie to watch?
user2: Hello Friend how are you
user1: Good, how are you
user2: it seems interesting this actor is pretty good
user1: 48% on rotten tomatoes isn't a bad score
user2: the cast of the film is great, only with morgan is enough to want to see it
user1: Jennifer Aniston alone would make me want to see the movie
user2: that girl is the best, but to put a comedian as a god, must be delirious
user1: it seems like a perfect fit for slapstick humor!
user2: Yes, Jim Carrey is quite a clown, it seems that this style still works
user2: the one that I do not like very much is Bruce Nolan, there is not something that does not fit with that being
user1: Well Bruce Nolan is Jim Carrey!
user1: Jim Carrey is the actor playing Bruce Nolan. 
user1: But I bet Bruce Nolan was upset when Evan Baxter got the job he wanted.
user2: I'm sorry, I meant Steve Carell
user1: Ok that makes sense now
user2: I'm sorry, I meant Steve Carell, el que hace de Evan Baxter
user1: It must have been difficult for Bruce to answer all those prayers.
user2: good for Bruce everything was superficial, he was focused on everything he deserved and not on what he should do
user1: I agree, it seems as though he lost track of the bigger picture
user2: It was very selfish to only respond to messages automatically without taking the time to read them
user2: the part where he fights with the abusers is excellent, how he handles it, and the little monkey was very rude
user1: Absolutely, he did not even listen to the concerns and dreams of those people.
user2: If he did not even take into account his girlfriend's prayers, he was very selfish, at that moment
user1: I do not understand what part you are referring to regarding the monkey and abusers
user1: Yeah, his girlfriend really wanted to get engaged. But, they did at the end!
user2: When he meets the abusers again, he makes a monkey out of the back of one of the boys
user1: I don't recall reading that.
user2: when he discovers, finally, what he must do, the man returns to be, a happy, relaxed guy, only that he had to recognize that more than he does not have an account
user2: that he owns, more than he realizes
user1: Yes, he definitely seems to realize his priorities at the end.
user2: Trying to discover your priorities seems to be something really frustrating in some people?
user2: especially if you do not realize how much you have, if not how much you want.
user2: If you have the opportunity to see it, it seems to be a very good movie
user1: Priorities, I would argue, are one of the most important things one needs to figure out in life to be truly happy.
user1: Yes, I should watch it.

conversation:
user1: hello

conversation:
user1: Hi.
user2: Hello. The movie is Bruce Almighty. Have you seen it?
user1: No, I haven't, but I've heard about it. Isn't that the one with Morgan Freeman as God?
user2: Yes.
user1: Sweet. I think Jim Carrey is pretty funny. 
user2: It got 48% rotten tomatoes and 5.7/10 overall
user2: Yeah, me too.
user2: I'm surprised by the ratings
user1: Oh, must not have been that good. Still, what do critics know, anyway?
user2: Right!
user1: So, tell me more. 
user2: He has such bad luck.
user2: He works as a tv field reporter
user2: He has a girlfriend but also has a crush on a coworker who doesn't even notice him
user1: Oh, so trying to play the field both ways, huh? 
user2: He got denied a promotion and his rival got it instead, so he's at his breaking point.
user2: Yes.
user1: Hmm.... if my rival got the promotion I wanted, I'd be pretty steamed, too.
user2: He interrupted him actually, during a live broadcast
user1: The jerk! And he still ended up with the promotion after that? 
user2: Yes.
user1: Incredible....
user2: Well Jim Carry interrupted 
user1: Oh...... 
user2: Then me got these powers
user2: and all of these good things started happening
user1: And of course, he got a little too power-happy and went too far.
user1: I take it, anyway.
user2: Then he started hearing the voice of God
user1: And?
user2: Tries to lead him down a better path.
user2: Because he was using his powers in a bad way.
user1: Oh yeah, because God does that kind of thing. 
user2: yes

conversation:
user2: Hi! Do you like comedy movies?
user1: yea
user1: how about you?
user2: Yeah. One of my favorites is Bruce Almighty. It's hilarious
user1: Yeah its a classic comedy for me.
user1: One of my favorite movies by jim carrey 
user2: Definitely. I really like Wanda Sykes in it, too
user2: Jennifer Aniston is good in it, too
user1: i dont remember wanda sykes in it but i though jennifer anniston was a good cast and morgan freeman as god was good to.
user1: what was your favorite scene in the movie
user2: I love the bird scene! Where Bruce is in the office and all the birds fly in the window
user1: my favorite scene was when bruce messed with steve carell as he was doing the news. 

conversation:
user2: The new movie is Bruce almity it’s a comedy we are talking about 
user2: It stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Almity
user2: Morgan freeman plays god 
user1: It also stars Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly
user1: Rotten Tomatoes has given Bruce Almighty a score of 48%
user2: Yes and Lisa Ann as debbie
user2: That’s not a great score for that 
user1: And only a 46 from Metacritic.  Also not a great score. 
user2: Jim Carrey is funny a great comedian in it 
user2: Yes that score is low I thought the movie was fun 
user2: One of his best films by far he is a free spirit in it 
user2: What do you think of Jim Carrey 
user2: His character is a funny new reporter 
user1: Carrey is a great comedian, and he was great in this movie
user2: Dream My of becoming a news anchor one day 
user2: Philip baker plays jack he was good too 
user1: The movie was directed by Tom Shadyac.  He did a great job. 
user2: Yes he did a great job 
user2: Morgan freeman has such range he played god and did a good job 
user1: Steve Carell is also in the movie as Jim Carrey's rival.  
user2: Steve is a funny man I like him In the office better then this movie too 
user1: Catherine Bell placed his second love interest in the movie, in additional to Jennifer Aniston.
user2: It’s funny when Jim Carrey takes over being god for one week 
user2: Oh I didn’t realize Catherine bell wasn’t in this movie too 
user2: He plays a down on his luck reporter what a change as the movie goes on 
user1: Well he gets to be God, so I guess that would change anyone
user2: He is a television filed reporter for news anchor one 
user1: Bruce created that email system to deal with all the prayers he received. Pretty smart. 
user2: Cinema score was a a surprising since all the other scores wereso low 
user1: All those voices in his head, having to be God, must have been a lot to hanlde
user2: His breaking point was when he was passed over for that promotion
user2: There was so many slapstick scenes 
user1: But he was able to fix that once he was God
user2: Yes he did a great job making you believe that 
user2: Steve stole his news story when he got passed for his promotion 
user1: Not surprised he ended up fixing things with Grace (Jennifer Aniston) in the end.  Maybe a little too sweet but an effective ending. 
user2: Grace breaks up with him only to see the real him at then end 
user2: He spends a lot of time complaining to god too
user2: This show was made in 2003 that was really long ago 
user1: He is a much better reporter in the end, having experienced "God"
user2: Yes he was bogged down too muc
user2: He was bogged down a lot 
user1: And the homeless man in the end was God
user1: That was a surprise

conversation:
user2: Hello :)
user1: Hi
user2: How are you?
user1: I am going to try and convince you that you should watch the movie Bruce Almighty.  Is this a movie that you have seen before?
user1: I am good :) how are you
user2: I am great thank you! 
user2: I have seen it once but it was so long ago! Refresh my memory please :D
user2: What is it about?
user1: Although this movie only received a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and a metacritic score of 46, at CinemaScore it scored an A.  The main character is played by Jim Carrey.  One critic claims that while Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, Bruce Almighty gets bogged down in treacle.  I had to look up the word treacle, it apparently means cloying sentamentality.  However another critic claims it to be one of Carreys best films.
user1: It is about a down on his luck TV reporter who complains to God that he is not doing his job correctly, and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.
user2: Wow only 48%!? I love Jim Carrey! Thank you for the information! I remember more, isn't Morgan Freeman the "God' in this movie?
user1: Morgan Freeman does play God, yes.  Jennifer Aniston plays Carrey's girlfriend.  Steve Carell plays Carreys rival at work.  I agree 48% is lower than I had expected.
user1: This movie is fifteen years old as it came out in 2003.  I can hardly believe how fast the time has gone by.
user2: Oh yeah!
user2: I forgot Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell were in it too!
user2: Seriously!? That is crazy, time really does pass quickly!
user1: The movie is set in Buffalo, New York.  There were a lot of famous people cast for this movie.  It was directed by Tom Shadyac.  I do not recognize his name from any other movies I can think of.
user2: Oh wow, I didn't remember it was set in New York. I haven't heard of Time Shadyac either
user2: I think my memory is combing this movie with "Dick & Jane" Have you seen it?
user1: I have not seen Dick and Jane, but I remember that coming out around the same time as this movie if I remember correctly.
user2: It was so funny! Jim Carrey is a great actor! What is one of the main scenes in Bruce Almighty?
user1: I have just recieved new information on Bruce Almighty, I am working off a provided pdf sheet of information that I am supposed to stick to while discussing this.  It says that Bruce (Carrey) uses his powers to get back at his work rival.  About mid-movie he is also starting to hear voices which Freeman explains to him our prayers to God.
user2: Oh  yeah! I remember that! It is such an interesting perspective :0
user2: * :)
user1: Bruce creates an email system to filter these prayers but finds that responding to all of them is too much work so he creates a program that will answer yes to everyone's prayers thinking that this will make everyone happy.
user2: Damn, I totally forgot about that! 
user2: Does the document say what that leads to?
user1: I am thinking that will be in the next part they give me, the next part will be the last part.  I do not remember myself what happens.  I am surprised I do not remember more about this movie.
user1: This last part does not tell me what the results of answering yes to every plan was.
user2: Same here, I feel like it is because I watched it when I was younger. There are a lot of things I don't remember haha (x
user2: I'm sure it was catastrophic
user2: What does the last part say?
user1: God appears and tells Bruce to pray for what he truly wants, and he wishes for his girlfriend to find a man that would make her happy.  He had been disappointing her a lot, mostly through not proposing but also by having a crush on a coworker.  This prayer lands Bruce and his girlfriend back together and engaged as apparently Bruce was the man that could make her happy all along.
user2: Damn, that is crazy! But I feel like it is a happy ending :D
user2: I just feel like it kind of sucks that he would be so careless about their relationship
user1: Yes.  I think that happy ending was rather unrealistic to some people and that may be why it got the poor reviews.  But I believe it was supposed to be seen more as a feel good comedy then a realistic portrayal of life.
user2: Definitely! That is a great point!
user2: It has been very nice discussing this movie with you! Have a beautiful day! :D
user1: I agree, he did not seem to put effort in the relationship and I feel Aniston deserved more.  But he did change his ways in the end. 
user2: She so did!
user1: You have a good day as well :)
user2: Thank you!

user2: The movies name is Bruce Almighty
user1: Perfect
user1: I've seen that movie plenty of times
user2: It is a comedy made in 2003 by Tom Shadyac
user2: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 48% with an average of 5.7/10
user2: While that seems low, its cinemascore is an A
user1: Yes it stars Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston
user1: Also starring Morgan Freeman
user2: Jes, Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan and Jennifer Aniston plays Grace Connelly
user2: Morgan Freeman plays God
user2: Lisa Ann WAlter plays Debbie Connely, and Philip Baker Hall plays Jack Baylor
user1: He plays a fine God doesn't he?
user2: The movie is about a down-on-his-luck Tv Reporter who meets God and complains to him that God is not doing his job correctly
user1: Steve Carrell also makes a couple of appearances 
user2: Yeah, and Bruce Nolan decides to take over being God for a week
user1: Then the powers go to his head
user1: Then he manipulates free will
user2: There is also a romantic part of the story about Bruce's girlfriend Grace, although he has a mild crush on his co-worker Susan Orlega (played by Catherine Bell)
user1: Sure does
user2: Yep, he uses his powers to cause all of these crazy miracles, earning his job back after he goes a bit crazy on air
user2: but has to deal with prayers from others, which are so overwhelming that he just says "yes" to all, trying to make everyone happy
user2: Does this movie sounds interesting to you?
user2: Would youi like to learn more about it?
user2: Some critics of the movie say that Jim Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, 
user2: another negative critic said that Jim Carrey's hopes to become an anchor is similar to Jim Carrey's hopes to become a real actor

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: Have you seen any good movies lately?
user1: Hello! Yes, we saw Black Panther in theaters and I liked it. How about you?
user1: How did you like Bruce Almighty?
user2: I actually just saw an older movie for the first time
user1: Oh which movie?
user2: I love Bruce Almighty
user1: Are you still there?

conversation:
user1: Hello, How are you?
user1: I would like to talk to you about the movie Bruce Almighty.
user1: Bruce almighty is a comedy that was released in 2003 directed by Tom Shadyac. It received okay but not phenomenal ratings despite its popularity. It was rated 48% with an average of 5.7/10 by Rotten Tomatoes. Received a Metacritic Score of 46/100 and a CinemaScore of an A!
user2: I am so sorry, I was late
user2: Thank you so much for waiting.
user2: Did you watch the movie?
user2: I am doing great. Thanks
user1: Bruce Almighty stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, Morgan Freeman as God, Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly, Lisa Ann Walter as Debbie Connely and Phillip Baker Hall as Jack Baylor.
user2: I love Jim Carrey movie and this one was also funny.
user1: Yes, I have seen it. "In one of Jim Carrey's best films he plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter that nurses hopesof one day becoming an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. Kind oflike Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor."
user2: Morgan Freeman as God is way to generic.
user2: Yeah, Jim Carrey is not so well these days.
user1: "Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but Bruce Almighty gets bogged down intreacle"
user2: Jim high point was in the 90s, though.
user2: What do you think about Jim Carrey today?
user2: I believe that since his ex girlfriend committed suicide he is a changed person.
user1: I do not think much of Jim Carrey today personally, This movie was one of the rare final good ones for me. Did you like this movie much?
user2: It was alright and I did like it.
user2: I will give it a 6 out of 10 how about you?
user1: It was especially good for me because it was around my hometown, like when Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV inBuffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. He is in a relationship with hisgirlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker,Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffersfrom constant bad luck and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion byhis rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from an unaired segment byBruce while accepting the promotion on air.
user2: Yeah, Bruce learned the hard way that being God is not so easy.
user1: Yes, He thought it was going to be a breeze, Kind oflike Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor."
user2: Yeah, I know what you mean. He is always seen as a joke actor and trying plays for more serious movies did not work out to good for him.
user1: My favourite in the movie had to of probably been Philip Baker Hall as Jack Baylor, how about yourself?
user2: I will have to say Morgan Freeman as God, he does fit the profile.
user1: Yes, He does quite well in every movie. I like how Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwisemundane events that he covers, such as discovering the body of Jimmy Hoffa, earning himhis job back, or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off. Bruce then uses hispowers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruceas the new anchor.
user2: The movie got mediocre rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Yes, a score is 48% is not that great at all.
user2: Yeah, that's quite low.
user1: I also like in the movie After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her about his promotion (disappointing her,as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must dealwith them. Bruce creates an e-mail system to receive prayers and respond to them - butfinds that the influx is far too great for him to handle, even with the use of his powers. So hesets the program to automatically answer "Yes" to every prayer, thinking this will makeeveryone happy. 
user1: Do you like this about it?
user2: Yes, I liked the movie, but it has been ages since I last watched it.
user1: God appears and tells Bruce to pray for what he truly wants; Bruce prays for Grace to find aman that would make her happy. God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortlyafter being miraculously revived by the doctors. Grace arrives and the two reconcile.
user1: Afterhis recovery, Bruce returns to his field of reporting, but takes more pleasure, in simplestories. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live television.
user1: television. The film ends witha homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages that Bruce previously ran intoon various occasions finally revealing himself to be God.
user2: Yes, that was a great scene with him walking on water.
user1: Yes, That was a very good part of the movie. 
user2: Wow, we've been here for quite a while.
user1: Haha yes, Movies are quite long. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Have you ever seen Bruce Almighty?
user1: Yes I have, how about you?
user2: I have. Did you like it?
user1: Yes, I liked it. I thought Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman were great in it. What did you think about it?
user2: I thought it was a great movie.
user1: Did you find it to be funny?
user2: Yes. Jim Carrey was great in it
user1: Agreed.
user2: Did you like Jennifer Aniston in it?
user1: LOL to be honest I barely remembered she was in it.
user2: I guess she wasn't too memorable then
user1: That or my memory isn't very good.
user2: It got a really low score on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Yes, I am actually surprised by the low score.
user2: Me too. That is way too low
user1: CinemaScore gave it an A which I think is fair.
user2: I agree with that one
user2: Did you like the story?
user1: Yes, I liked the story. I generally like movies that have a life lesson.
user2: Me too. They are more fun to watch
user1: I nearly forgot Steve Carell is in that movie too.
user2: I thought he was in part 2
user1: He is in part 1 too, he was the news anchor who got the promotion.
user2: Oh, I see. I remember now
user2: What do you think of the Metacritic score?
user1: I think it is way too low as well. I wonder why people gave the movie such a low score
user2: Me too. I don't mind though. I know it was a good film
user2: I didn't realize it came out in 2003. That seems so long ago.
user1: Yea, I agree. I wonder if the scores are newer?
user2: I'm not sure
user1: Yea 2003 seems so long ago, I feel old.

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hi. Have you seen this movie, Bruce Almighty?
user1: I don't think I have.
user1: is it any good?
user2: It's not a new movie, it was made in 2003, but if you like Jim Carrey you'll enjoy it.
user1: Oh yeah, I do like a few of Carrey's movies, what is it about?
user2: It's more like a slapstick comedy. He's a TV reporter who complains to the man above. So through the move, God (morgan freeman) lets him take over, basically.
user1: Oh nice, I like Morgan Freeman. cool he is in it, so it's comedy as usual? That't what Jim is best at!
user2: Yes, I remember the movie. What is funny is him playing God. He cannot keep up with all the requests God receives every day, every hour, etc.
user1: sounds entertaining for sure.
user1: How are the ratings?
user2: Well, Rotten Tomatoes gives it 48 percent and average 5.7/10 . CinemaScore A 
user1: kind of all over the place I guess, did you like it? what would you rate it?
user2: I liked it but I like him. Some of his movies I didn't care for but this one I did. He's just silly. Jennifer Aniston is in the movie also as his girlfriend.
user1: surprised never heard of it with freeman, carey, AND Aniston in it! 
user1: I like his movies as well especially Truman show.
user2: I've followed Carey since he started on the old show "In Living Color" as Fireman Bill. Had me rolling. 
user1: He is a good actor. How does it all end then? does he say I don't want to be god anymore ? lol
user2: He listens to "God" and learns to stop thinking God wasn't taking care of things. He saw firsthand. He also almost lost his girlfriend because he wanted to be top dog at his job so bad. 
user1: ah so kind of a movie about morals and being grateful for what you have?
user2: Exactly. What makes it funny is watching him for that one week when he knew he had the "power" and man did he use that power. The music that played with it was good too. 
user1: yeah I think I may have to look into it, must of missed it when it came out or was popular
user1: I would like to see what like to have that power lol
user2: Isn't it funny how we can miss out on movies sometimes. I was just checking netflix earlier and saw a couple of movies I hadn't seen.
user1: Yeah I like to check out redbox every so often online to see whats new and recent
user2: I check Redbox also once in awhile and they send me coupons. The one scene where Jim Carrey
user2: character trys to answer all the e-mails in the world that God gets. He couldn't keep up, it was crazy.
user1: oh thats funny, god getting emails! 
user2: His character is reporter Bruce Nolan, sounds so official doesn't it?
user1: very professional
user1: I loved jim in "dick and jane"
user2: I didn't see that movie. Who's that actor that played on "The Office" - well, i'm older so I forget. Bruce Nolan tries to flub up the desk anchor and boy he does, I had tears in my eyes. 
user1: oooh i know carrel?
user1: steve
user1: sounds like I will have to watch it for sure!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello! 
user1: Have you seen Bruce Almighty? 
user2: Yes I have actually
user2: Have you?
user1: It's a comedy from 2003 staring Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan.
user2: Oh maybe not then, I always get that confused with Evan Almighty 
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: I have! It's funny. It got a good cinema score but only 48% on rotten tomatoes. 
user2: Typical I guess
user2: Have you seen Evan Almighty, are they similar? 
user2: The one I'm thinking of is about a man building an Ark
user2: I know who Jim Carrey is but I can't think of the other actors name 
user1: I'm not sure about that, but I do know in this movie Jim Carrey stars as a down on his luck reporter.
user2: Ok, two different story lines 
user1: He is in a relationship with a woman named Grace staring Jennifer Aniston but has a mild crush on his co-worker, so you can imagine there's a little bit of conflict there.
user2: lol yes, I can just imagine 
user2: Are you a Jim Carrey fan in general?
user1: Bruce, played by Carrey, ends up complaining to God and God offers him the chance to be God for a week.
user2: Ok wow, two different story lines but still similar to the other movie I was telling you about. 
user1: Do you typically enjoy watching comedies?
user2: yes I do 
user2: What about you? 
user1: When you watch Bruce Almighty, note that Bruce gains special powers in being God, creating some hilarious situations!
user2: Will do. I can just imagine how funny it is lol
user1: I liked the part where Bruce even used his powers to cause extreme events to happen, like a meteor to harmlessly land near a cookoff!
user2: Wow lol 
user1: Eventually, he starts to hear voices and asks God what they were, who responds that they're prayers. So Bruce goes onto make a prayer email system to deal with the massive influx.
user2: Wow, interesting. I have to check it out. 
user1: To deal with the situation he caused, he ends up making a mass response system granting 'yes' to all prayers.
user2: lol interesting 
user1: He thinks this will make everyone happy, but I'm sure you can imagine how it turns out.
user2: lol absolutely 
user2: Does he stick with Jennifer Aniston in the end or no? 
user1: Yeah! He totally did and even proposed on live tv in the movie!
user1: That's the end of the conversation, I don't want to tell you the ending. It makes me feel bad.
user1: Thanks!

user1: It's only right that he was God
user2: exactly, he should literally be god

user1: aight peace out

conversation:
user1: So what movie would you like to discuss?
user2: Hello, have you seen Bruce Almighty?
user2: With Jim Carrey?
user2: Jim Carrey is really funny complaning about everything and also complaining with God. Also Morgan Freeman is amazing as God, don't you think?
user2: It is really funny that it was offered to Bruce the chance to be God for a week.Don't you think?
user2: Do you agree that this is one of Jim Carrey's best movie?
user2: Hello?
user2: Have you seen it on the theater?
user2: Hello?
user2: Are you there?
user2: Did you prefer Carrey's or Freeman's role in the movie?

conversation:
user2: hi there
user1: Hi 
user2: how are you
user1: I'm doing well. you want to talk about a movie?
user2: yes of course
user1: OK - Bruce Almighty came out in 2003 and is a comedy staring Jim Carry, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston 
user2: oh finally a comic one i think?.
user2: it should be a great one
user1: Yes. Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.
user1: Do you pay attention to reviews, like Rotten Tomoatoes or Metacritic Score?
user2: looks interesting
user2: yeap
user1: Ok. it scored so-so, but the reviews were pretty good.
user1: You want to hear about a funny scene? Just to understand the film a little better? 
user2: so any special reference?. because as i see the cast it should be a good quallity movie
user2: yes i am all ears
user1: Ok - So Bruce suffers from bad luck 
user2: why?
user1: just because. he wants a promotion. One day he gets passed over for a promotion and he realizes it when the person who got the promotion announces it on air
user1: But when he gets his God powers he ends up getting back at that person 
user2: no way, that's evil...
user2: but how he gets God powers?
user1: yeah - the way he gets back at him is by using his powers to cause the guy to humiliate himself on air. he ends up getting fired and Bruch finally gets his promotion 
user1: God gives them to him 
user2: haha, on air did he make him look foolish?
user1: yes - so bad he got fired! 
user2: God must be Freeman ?
user1: yes 
user2: hem look interesting
user2: please tell some other scenes
user1: And then God shows up again to guide him a little more. In the end Bruce returns to his old job, but takes more pleasure in it 
user2: so he cannot afford God Powers?
user1: He can - but God wants him to use them for things he really truly wants. I guess after that discussion, Bruce realizes it's not the promotion, it's engaging in simple stories 
user2: Bruce uses those powers to make fun I think?
user2: so selfish
user1: at first he does, but after the last convo with God, he does more good for himself and people around him
user2: to make him more special?
user1: I don't think so 
user2: does any other person know that Bruce has those God powers?
user1: you would have to check that online
user2: mmm as i see it is a good one
user1: yes. you should check it out sometime soon
user2: I think I should see others reviews if they had fun
user1: Yes - the reviews were okay. they say it's slapstick and funny.
user1: do you have any other questions?
user2: have you any idea  where should i check these reviwes, sure and the movi to
user2: movie too
user1: rotten tomatoes, metacritic and cinamascore have ratings 
user2: sorry i got some technic problems on my keyboard
user1: you'd have to check online where to purchase the movie 
user1: no worries
user2: oh I am very interested to see them
user2: thank you mate.
user1: sounds good! have a nice day!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello!
user1: Do you generally like watching comedies?
user2: Yes, I love comedies! Especially romantic comedies, but really any comedy is a great movie.
user1: That's awesome! Yeah I agree. So what did you think of Bruce Almighty?
user2: Bruce Almighty is hilarious! Jim Carrey plays his role so well.
user1: Yes! It is definitely one of my favorite movies. Jim Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes. Also I think Morgan Freeman was a good addition to the movie and I'm a sucker for anything with Jennifer Anniston in it. I'm pretty suprised about the Rotten Tomatoes score though its pretty low for how good I think the movie was.
user2: Really? That is surprising! My whole family and all of my friends love the movie! I can't imagine that it received a low rating. 
user1: Yeah! I loved it too and I think that if you have the chance you should re-watch it because it is such a classic movie.
user2: Yes! I have some free time this afternoon. I wonder if it is on Netflix. I'd love to watch it again, but don't have a DVD copy of the movie. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user2: I thought that Bruce Almighty was a very funny movie.
user1: What do you think of the cast choice for this movie?
user1: I also thought it was a good movie - an interesting idea but one that could have offended some people
user2: Jim Carrey was perfect as Bruce and Morgan Freeman was really cool as God in the movie.
user1: Do you think the movie could have offended some people?
user2: The slapstick is great, but I can see some people being offended
user1: Do you think that explains the low ratings
user2: Possibly, a comedy movie us usually divisive. 
user2: Buffalo was an interesting setting
user1: Why would you say that
user2: Also Steve Carrel as Evan Baxter was a good side character
user2: Buffalo is not used much.
user1: Would you say Buffalo was more of a rural or suburban setting?
user2: Evan was a pretty unlikable character, he undermined Bruce.
user1: What do you think of this particular key scene that is being described in the document now
user2: It is urban/suburban
user2: Bruce also treats Grace rather poorly in this movie.
user2: He acts rather selfish.
user1: I agree, he should have been clear about his emotions to her (in regards to the coworker)
user2: Yes, Bruce later begins to realize his responsibilities.
user1: What do you think about Bruce saying "yes" to everyone's prayers
user2: Bruce want to make everyone happy, it is noble, but not feasible.
user1: I agree
user2: Bruce starts to really become unselfish
user1: I dont think he becomes unselfish, but he does realize that everything happens for a reason 
user1: and that he should appreciate the little things more
user2: He now has more concern for others, not just himsekf
user1: Why do you think the actor director chose to make a homeless man represent god
user2: *himself
user1: Yes, that is true, but he doesn't change himself to be better in the way of helping people, he still focuses on himself
user2: God is everywhere, God is always with Bruce for example
user1: But I think the homeless man represented that God may not seem to be what you think
user1: Thanks for the convo, have a good day
user2: As the CinemaScore shows general audiences really liked the movie because of the A rating.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Anybody home?
user2: Hi
user2: Easy boy :)
user1: Hey the movie is bruce almighty
user1: haha
user2: Ya, I know. 
user1: ok
user2: What do you think about the movie?
user1: I loved it, jim carrey is awesome
user1: Plus morgan freeman as god was amazing
user1: What about you?
user2: Same thought. 
user1: Are you a steve carrell fan?
user2: The ratings seemed a bit harsh on the movie. Dont know why
user1: Slapstick comedy is only for true humorists 
user2: true
user1: The cinema score waas an A though
user2: One thing I loved about the movie was that it gives you the perspective of being God.
user1: Yea it would be hard to recreate a perspective like that
user1: Do you remember the scerne with steve carrell on air going crazy?
user2: dont remember the scene. what  you can tell me about it?
user1: Jim carrey takes over steve corrells body and makes him speak gibberish live 
user2: aha I have just looked it up on youtube. great scene indeed
user2: if I am not wrong, is not Steve Carrell that makes the sequel of this movie? like the main actor?
user1: i used to rewind that scene when i was a kid
user1: Yea thats him
user1: i think its evan almighty and it did not do well
user2: Jim Carrey is in another level. He has been through some really bad things in his life but I hope to see him return to his legendary level in the future
user1: I really liked jennifer anistons role too
user1: Yea jim has a special energy, like robin williams had 
user1: \
user2: True.
user2: Jennifer is a funny woman but her role here was a little cliche I think. 
user2: Morgan and Jim are the true stars of the movie.
user2: I would love to see a sequel of this movie with the same cast
user1: Yea that would be awesome to see
user1: Which character do you identify with most?
user2: Between Morgan and Jim but what I really like is the way the movie tries to make understand how being God is not that great.
user2: At the beginning Bruce thinks he has all the power in the world to do whatever he wants but when he realises that every person future is his responsability, things start to change.
user1: lol the scene where he emails answers to peoples prayers was funny
user2: lol man you have a elephant memory :)(
user1: haha thanks but i used to watch it a lot as a kid
user2: I remember that scene. One of the best, yea.
user1: Yea good scene
user1: I think we are done
user2: Yap
user2: good time talking with you
user1: Nice talking to you
user2: have a good day
user1: You as well!

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you today?
user2: good how about you?
user1: Doing great.
user2: Thats good. The movie Bruce Almighty seems like it would be a really good movie to watch. It got a CinemaScore of an A.
user1: That's an interesting title. Who's in it?
user2: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Aniston just to name a few. 
user1: Ha! It must be a comedy then. I don't think I've ever seen Jim Carrey in anything serious.
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user2: It's definitely a Comedy, slapstick style humor and awesome jokes.
user1: Yeah, that sounds like Jim's style. How was the rotten tomatoes score on it?
user2: It came out back in 2003 so it's somewhat old, but sometimes older comedies are better.
user2: They only gave it a 5.7/10, but they don't usually rate comedies very highly
user1: I think it's good that it came out that late, It probably wouldn't of even made it to theaters considering people get a bit uptight now about certain topics.
user1: Yeah Rotten tomatoes are terrible at grading films.
user2: He plays a news anchor in it trying to get a promotion, and ends up with classic Jim Carrey esk type stunts and shenanigans along the way. 
user1: Who does morgan play in the film?
user2: He plays the character God in the film.
user1: Wait what?
user1: He plays god? As in the God?
user2: Yep that God. Jim Carrey's character, Bruce Nolan, ends up down on his luck and complains to "god" outloud about not getting anything he wants, so Morgan Freeman playing God comes down and grants him the power to be God.
user1: Oh, this just got so much more interesting.
user1: So, he get's to be god for a day or something?
user2: Nope, until he learns his lesson type.
user2: It spans over the course of a month or so.
user1: wow, so God is trying to teach Bruce a lesson by making him into a God?
user1: Something tells me he doesn't learn the lesson right away.
user2: Yeah, but with slapstick style antiques. At one point, Carreys character can
user2: can't stand listening to all the prayesrs of people, so he makes an automated message service to respond to them.
user1: Ha! I can imagine. It sounds like a great film.
user2: Yeah, he ends up setting it respond to every prayer with yes, and you can imagine how that must go.
user1: What would you personally rate the film?
user2: I'd personally rate it well worth watching, it's not just a comedy, but a learning/love story mixed in.
user1: Sounds good, I will absolutely give it a watch.
user2: He has a girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston, who leaves him when he can't figure out whats truly important to him, which is kind of what sets him down his crazy antiques road.
user2: And in the end, after learning his lesson, he chooses to let her find someone who truly makes her happy.
user1: Interesting stuff.
user1: Can't wait to give it a watch.
user2: Can't say anymore about that portion without giving the end away :p
user1: yeah, no spoilers. Thanks for the movie review.
user2: no problem, hope you end up liking it!

conversation:
user2: Hey there
user2: Jim Carrey is a very likeable actor don't you think?
user2: I like all of his movies honestly
user1: Bruce Almighty was an incredibly funny movie. What do you think?
user2: oh yeah, its definitely one of his best. 
user1: He is incredibly funny when he is doing comedy but he can be very serious too. 
user2: He is very good in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind as well.
user1: I like when Jim parted the TTomato Soup.
user1: Man In The Moon was good
user2: Wow the rattings are so low on rotten tomatoes and metacrtitc to
user2: but it is a great movies
user2: man on the moon is great
user1: I know. I usually prefer my own interpretation of the movie. 
user2: I think people don't like Jennifer Aniston and maybe thats why it was ratted low?
user1: Maybe, 
user1: Jim does some of the best slapstick.
user2: His early years really show that greatly 
user1: I remember In Living color. One of the first prime time shows I ever watched.
user2: I was a little kid when it was out my parents would get upset if i watched it lol
user2: The way jim carey uses his powers are way to funny
user1: If Jim was a real news anchor I would definitely was that news program.
user2: That would be amazing 
user2: He should take jimmy fallons spot hahah
user1: For some reason the document does't mention Steve Carell.
user2: The power of yes was very strong in bruce almighty
user2: yeah i noticed that to
user1: Even Stephen. Hilarious
user2: The ending had some powerful moments in it as well
user1: Like Bruce and everyone else often pray fr thin that seem out of reach. 
user2: Sometimes even when its the moon which is one of my favortie parts of the movie
user1: I know the Meteor.
user1: It's dirty but I like the Nipple Picture.
user1: It was cold that day.
user2: I love how god is morgan freeman, because it wouldn't make sense any other way if you really think about it
user1: Maybe it would work in Shawshank but otherwise the player definitely fit the part.
user1: Anyway, It's been fun chatting.
user2: It really has! Thank you and have a great day : )

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi there
user2: Have you ever seen this movie?
user1: What's the name of the movie?
user2: Bruce Almighty
user1: No I haven't seen it. Is it any good?
user2: It did not get a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I liked it though
user1: That happens a lot with Rotten Tomato
user1: Who is in the movie?
user2: Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston
user1: Ah, they can both be good in the right movie.
user1: What's the movie about?
user2: It's about Jim Carrey becoming God
user1: That's an interesting thought?
user1: er, no question mark needed
user2: Yeah, interesting premise
user1: What does he do as God?
user2: it came out in 2003. As God, he just deals with a bigger reality and learns to be more loving. The usual story
user1: Yeah, the usual
user2: It came out in 2003
user1: He was making a lot of movies around that time.
user2: Yeah, he was
user1: What role did Jennifer Aniston have?
user2: she played his wife
user1: Did she believe that he was God?
user2: Not at first, but she learns as well. You know how it is
user1: What was the funniest thing he did as God?
user2: I can't remember. I do remember that he got everyone's prayers as sort of a mental email and there were millions he had to answer
user1: Ah, I kind of remember that trailer
user1: Something about him clearing out his inbox
user2: Yes
user1: and then a million more emails showing up

conversation:
user2: hello
user2: How are you today?
user1: hi
user1: i am ok
user1: how are you
user2: I'm great thank you 

conversation:
user1: I really liked this movie I think it was well done. 
user2: Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes
user1: I really liked Morgan Freeman as God. I just watched Evan last night
user2: If I just went by the Rotten Tomatoes score of 48% I probably would not have watched this movie
user1: I normally don't even pay any attention to the rotten tomatoes score. It the last thing I look at. 
user1: Do you like slapstick movies?
user2: It is nice to have reviews by both critics and movie goers to get a feel for the movie.  I am not a big slapstick fan, but Morgan Freeman helps to give this movie some grounding so it's not all dumb humor.
user1: Yes I totally agree with the Morgan Freeman being a great ground. He is such a good actor. 
user2: Of course his voice makes a great "God"
user1: What would you rate this movie?
user2: Probably a 7/10 
user1: I would agree with that. 
user1: Do you think that this movie could ever really happen?
user2: Not sure if Jennifer Aniston makes sense in this film as the girlfriend
user1: Who would you rather have seen in this, if she is not the ideal 
user2: That question gets into religion and philosophy so I guess I would have to say no.
user1: I completely understand that,. 
user2: It would be interesting if it was someone funny.  They put 2 male comic actors together but usually not a male and female.
user2: Now I would like the powers that Jim Carrey had in the movie
user1: The restaurant scene was really funny, I liked that the voices kept getting in the way. 
user2: His email solution to the prayers sounds like being stuck on an automated phone system
user1: Ha yeah but getting what you wanted all the time. 
user1: Having those powers would be awesome
user2: Unless yes doesn't answer your question!
user1: So that brings us to the ending. What did you think about how it ended?
user2: The ending seems more like a rom-com.
user2: A bit too cliche
user1: Everything works out and now one gets hurt. 
user2: That's the movies - not life.
user1: Yeah in real life there would be no job now girl and no dog. 
user2: Glad to get this movie and not a superhero one I don't know anything about.
user1: Maybe just the dog
user2: I'll take the dog or cat... less drama
user2: Are you a movie buff?
user1: yeah less drama is good. 
user1: I like the old ones. 
user1: Pre 1960
user2: Think I'l still stuck in the 80s
user2: I'm
user1: Where everyone had money. 
user2: They didn't have the special effects back before '60 so actually had to have substance

conversation:
user1: I just saw Bruce Almighty
user2: Who! Did you like it?
user2: Sorry I meant to say wooh! 

conversation:
user1: Hello how are you?
user2: I am good thank you
user2: I have the movie Bruce Almighty have you ever seen this movie?
user1: Any movie recommendations?
user1: Whoops sent too late lol!
user1: Yes I have! But it’s been a while 
user2: Its ok not a problem I like this movie it was hilarious and refreshing would you ever watch it again?
user1: Wasn’t there a sequel called Evan Almighty as well?
user2: It has many actors in this movie Jim Carey, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston which one was your favorite and I dont believe so that it was related to this movie
user1: Oh wow! I completely forgot Jennifer Aniston was in it
user2: Yes she was Jim Careys girl friend in this movie he was an upcoming reporter 
user1: What ratings did the film get?
user2: it received a cinema score of A
user1: It would be pretty cool to have God’s power just for day. How would you feel about that lol
user2: It was a great comedy for 2003 and the movie was great I could see myself playing a role lol
user2: It has been a long time I think I would love to watch it again you can never have enough laughs
user1: Man 2003 was so long ago! It’s still feels so fresh in my mind 
user2: that is probably because the likability of the movie hard to forget something so funny but has a relatable subject to it
user2: Catherine Bell was also in the movie as the co worker he had a crush on forgot about her to
user2: Morgan Freeman played a wonderful part in being GOD his voice is an icon somehow its what I pictured him sounding like lol
user1: Oh Mr Freeman and his gorgeous voice! That was the movie that made him an icon?!
user2: so you would definately watch it again
user1: Yah I suppose....I need more convincing though 
user2: Do you remember when Jim Carey got to be God and he answered yes to every prayer thinking everyone would be happy
user1: Oh yeah wasn’t he on the computer trying to type it out
user2: Do you remember the love seen where he lasso the moon for Jennifer
user1: Now I think I forgot about that one
user2: Bruce aka Jim Carey gets in an accident and GOD tells him to think about what he really wants and then Grace shows to hospital when hes awake and then he goes back to being a reporter and appreciates what hes given
user1: Awww what a sweet message! I love Jim Carey and he did the role very well
user2: This is not only a comedy but a love story and has a simple moral meaning behind it accept who we are great movie great actors 2 for 1 with comedy and romance 
user1: Well I guess Ill watch it again sometime soon

conversation:
user2: The movie is Bruce Almighty
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: I have not!
user1: Is it any good?
user2: It's really funny
user2: Jim Carrey at his finest
user1: I love Jim Carrey!
user2: and anything with Morgan Freeman is always good
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: Jim Carrey pretty much becomes god
user1: Oh wow, sounds unique to say the least.
user1: I believe this movies been out for a while, right?
user2: Yeah it came out 15 years ago
user2: I can't believe it came out that long ago
user2: it still holds up though
user1: Wow that's crazy, because I do remember seeing previews for it
user1: It didn't seem like it was that long ago
user1: but I guess time flies
user1: It makes sense though, I don't think i've seen Jim Carrey star in many movies lately
user2: Yeah Jim Carrey plays a reporter and complains to god about work since he didn't get a promotion and then Morgan Freeman who plays god let's him be god for a week
user2: It is a pretty unique plot
user1: Hah, that sounds great
user1: It's pretty funny that they'd make Morgan Freeman play god too
user1: I guess it's all in his voice
user1: I think I might try and see if I can find this movie on Netflix
user2: He controls the weather so he causes a meteor to land in a park during a bbq which freaks everyone out
user2: yeah it might be on Netflix
user1: I like both actors, and it does seem in my realm of enjoyment
user2: Oh and Steve Carell is in it also! He's the best
user1: Oh wow I didn't know that!
user1: I'm a huge fan of the Office so that alone is incentive to watch it for me
user1: Anything he's in normally turns out pretty great
user2: I completely forgot he was in it. Now I want to watch it again
user1: Haha that's awesome!
user1: Does he play a big role in it or is it more of just a minor character?
user2: He plays Jim Carrey's rival in the movie
user2: They are both reporters and Steve Carell gets the promotion

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1:  I'm good and you?  Today we'll be discussing Bruce Almighty.
user1: It's a comedy with Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Aniston.
user2: Oh awesome, I've never seen that film before, always wanted to.
user2: I love Jim Carrey. What's his role?
user1: Jim Carrey, places Bruce Nolan, who is kind of your typical everyday guy, who's down on his luck and complains to God (Morgan Freeman).
user2: Haha, so Morgan Freeman plays God? I'm sure this movie is hilarious then!
user1: Yeah, the reviews weren't the greatest.  One says Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but the movie gets bogged down in the treacle.
user2: Well jeez, that reviewer must not have enjoyed the film using a word like "treacle"!
user2: What role does Jen Anniston play?
user1: It doesn't really say, just says her characters name is Gracey Connelly.
user1: Oh, there it is, she plays Bruce's(Jim Carrey's character) girlfriend.
user2: Oh, very nice, I like her in comedy movies so I'm sure she's great. 
user2: What's the plot of the movie?
user1: Steve Carrell is in it as well, and that's the Bruce's breaking point.  Bruce plays a newsreporter aspiring to become a new anchor, and hits his breaking point when he gets passed over for the job by rival reporter Steve Carrell (who plays Evan Baxter.
user2: Sounds funny! Always good to have rivalry in comedy, especially with those two actors cause they are both hysterical in their own right.
user2: Did you have any favorite moments from the film?
user1: I think the whole movie is pretty good
user1: After complaining to God, God gives Bruce all the powers of being God.
user2: Whoa haha, seems like a risky move with Jim Carey at the helm!
user1: Yeah he then makes all sorts of miracles happen, and humiliates Steve Carrell's character.
user2: As to be expected, I guess. I would mess with Steve Carrell in that position as well!
user2: Is it all comedic, or is their drama involved as well?
user1: But he eventually hears voices in his head, and finds out they are all people praying to him and becomes overwhelmed.
user1: So I'd say theres a bit of drama.
user2: Oh wow, yeah, that does seem overwhelming.. Never thought about it like that, almost kinda sad.
user1: After that fiasco the real God (Morgan Freeman) returns, and tells Bruce to pray for what he really wants.
user1: After that he prays for his characters girlfriend to find a man that would make her happy, which in the end, ends up being Bruce.
user2: Hmm, interesting, nice way to spin the film. So it's got a bit of romantic drama in it as well. I like that. 
user1: Yeah, a little bit I suppose
user2: That's nice. I like movies that spread across dramas a bit, especially comedies. 
user2: Seems like a fun film though!
user2: Thanks for sharing info about the film, I'll be sure to check it out
user1: Good deal, and have a great day :)

conversation:
user2: Bruce Almighty is a film about a man who is given omnipotence by God as a challenge in his life. 
user1: Is the movie a comedy?
user2: The movie is a comedy. 
user2: While some reviewers rated it as perfectly average, others consider it Jim Carrey's best role. 
user1: So, the movie has high ratings?
user2: About 50/100 or 5/10 ratings. 
user1: Is there more to the story line? For example, why does he receive omnipotence by God? What kind of challenges does he have to face with it?
user2: He is given omnipotence when he decides that his life will never be happy and that God cannot be that great if he is so miserable. He has to learn to balance the power and see that God had instilled in him the ability to do great, but he had ignored it the entire time. He has to put back together the life he had before and find comfort in his career and win back his true love's affection. 
user1: Ok, it sounds like a good movie. Would you recommend it?
user2: I would highly recommend it. It is a comedy but it isn't afraid to dig into human emotions and really grip you with the story line.
user1: You said in your response earlier that the main character has to win back his true love's affection. Is the movie more of a romantic comedy? Or is this just a small part of the movie and not enough to label it a romantic comedy?
user2: The romance is just one small element of the movie. 
user1: It does sound like an interesting movie. I think I will try to watch it in the future. 
user2: You should. 
user1: Who directed the film?
user2: Tom Shadyac
user1: Are there other popular actors in the movie other than Jim Carrey?
user2: Jennifer Anniston and Morgan Freeman
user1: What roll does Morgan Freeman play in the movie?
user2: God
user1: What film production company came out with this movie?
user1: Is the movie family friendly?
user2: I'm not sure
user2: The movie is family friendly
user1: Would you recommend it for kids? Do you think it would hold their attention?  
user2: It could hold their attention
user1: Is this an older movie, or was it released recently? 
user2: It was released on 2003
user1: Is there anything else you can think of that would persuade me to watch the movie?

user1: Hi what's the name of the movie?
user2: Did you ever see Bruce Almighty?
user2: Jim Carrey is hilarious in this comedy.
user1: I haven't, what's it about?
user2: Morgan Freeman is incredible playing the part of God.
user2: Jim Carrey who plays Bruce Nolan a struggling TV reporter complains to God
user1: What does he complain about?
user2: He tells God he's not doing his job correctly.
user1: Ohh I see. So is this a family movie?
user2: So then Freeman (God) offers him the chance to be God for a week.
user2: It seems to be
user1: What is the rating on this movie?
user2: I'm not sure but at least PG since it seems to need parental guidance.
user2: Do you like the director Tom Shadyac?
user1: I've never heard of him, has he directed anything else?
user2: I don't know, but he did a good job with the plot of Carey getting frustrated by not getting a promotion and then trying his luck at being God.
user1: Is God a funny character or a serious character?
user2: It's a comedy so with Morgan Freeman you seem to get a little of both.
user1: That's cool! Is there a love interest in this movie?
user2: Well, he takes a character Grace to a fancy dinner and disappoints her
user2: He sets up an email account for people to talk to him but it gets overloaded so he just answers all of them with "Yes."
user1: Does he do anything bad when he is God?
user1: Besides the email thing, which is funny.
user2: Well he does have a crush on two women
user1: Who's the other woman?
user2: He has a mild crush on co-worker Susan Ortega who barely notices him
user1: Does he end up with one or neither in the end?
user2: Bruce had an interaction with God where he prayed Grace find a man that makes her happy
user2: Then he wakes up in the hospital and reconciles with Grace
user2: They get engaged on live TV
user1: Wow!
user1: Is there a bad guy in this movie?
user2: The movie ends with a homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages on it revealing himself to be God.
user2: Evan is the bad guy and Bruce uses his powers to get him fired
user2: Evan had gotten the promotion Bruce wanted.
user2: Well hope you have a good day! Bye
user1: Same goodbye!

user1: I thought it had some laughs
user2: Yeah, it did make me laugh a couple of times.
user1: I liked evan almighty a little more
user2: I thought it was a little worse, to be honest.
user1: really? I guess just a little biased because it had morgan freeman
user2: I prefer jim carrey over steve carrell, so I might be a little biased myself.
user1: i really loved the office so i guess that where i get it from
user1: lol
user2: Yeah, and I liked Ace Ventura as a kid.
user1: Ive only seen that a few times
user2: I remember loving it as a kid, haven't seen it in a loooong time though.

user1: Its a really great movie...
user2: Who is in it?
user1: its very funny with a lot of popular actors/actresses such as Jim Carey and Jennifer Aniston
user2: Oh that is so cool. I love Jim and Jennifer
user1: It is about a guy who thinks god is not doing his job and is given a chance to play god for the day lol
user1: I can only imagine what that would be like lol
user1: Thats a tough job if you ask me lol
user2: Lol that sounds like a good movie. I could only imagine too lol
user2: It sounds hard
user1: Definately ..but this movie puts a comedy twist to it
user2: Really how?
user1: If your a Jim Carey fan ...you should definately check it out :)
user2: I might this weekend.
user1: He desires to be a anchorman and trys to make things go his way...but as we know that cant always happen lol
user1: so as he plays god...
user2: That is true, life doesn't happen that way
user1: he has to answer emails for prayers lol and try to stay on top of everyones requests.. and hears the voices of people doing so as hes trying to do everyday stuff.. not to let on his disguise
user2: Oh wow
user1: I dont want to give away too much and spoil it lol

user2: Haha okay lol

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello.
user2: We're discussing Bruce Almighty.
user2: Wow that was 2003. I feel so old!
user1: Haha I can't believe that was 15 years ago. 
user2: I never saw it. Not a huge Jim Carrey fan.
user1: It was one of Jim Carrey's better movies.
user2: And it's never good when there are three writers lol.
user1: He's not for everyone thats for sure. I'm a big fan of his stuff. 
user1: This particular one was a bit moralistic for my tastes but it still had some really good moments. 
user2: Well I will say that one with Kate Winslet was exceptional.
user1: Ah yes. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It was much more indie than most of his movies. 
user2: Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend in this one. This would have been when she was really popular.
user2: Yes that's the one. One of my all time favorite movies.
user1: Yeah 2003 was right after Friends had ended so she was at the height of her fame. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!
user2: What movie did you watch?
user1: Bruce Almighty! I love Jim Carrey.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Awesome!  No, I haven't seen it yet and I was thinking about watching it though.
user2: What is it about?
user1: Oh it's hilarious. It didn't receive a huge score on rotten tomatoes, but it had a really good cinema score. 
user2: What is it about?
user1: It's about a down on his luck reporter who complains to God and is offered a chance to be God for a week.
user2: And the reporter is Jim Carrey?
user1: Yes the reporter is Jim Carrey and it also stars Jennifer Aniston as his wife and Steve Carell as the antagonist. 
user2: I like Jim Carrey, he's a riot.  I don't know about Jennifer Anniston, so they had a happy marriage?
user1: He actually has a crush on his co-worker, played by Catherine Bell, so there's some conflict with his relationship with Jennifer Aniston. 
user2: Oh, okay.  How does he get to be God?
user2: Does he have special powers?
user1: God is played by Morgan Freeman, and by complaining to God about his situation, Morgan Freeman offers him the opportunity to be God for a week.
user1: Yes, Bruce(Jim Carrey) does have special powers that allow him to cause miraculous events for the week he plays God.
user2: That sounds hilarious.  Morgan Freeman is so respectable.
user2: Did anyone know he was God or was it a secret?
user1: It is hilarious, he ends up causing his co-worker/antagonist, Steve Carell, to embarrass himself on live television by using his powers. 
user2: That does sound funny.
user1: He also creates an e-mail system to streamline prayer responses.
user2: lol How does that work out for him/
user1: Well, he found that even after streamlining the system, he was getting too many emails so he created an auto response system, granting everyone their prayers.
user2: That's funny.
user1: Near the end, God ends up telling Bruce that he needs to pray for what he really wants. He prays for Jennifer Aniston to find a man that will make her happy. 
user2: Does he just revert back to reporter after a week?
user1: He does end up reverting back to reporter after a week with a newfound pleasure in the simple stories he previously reported.
user2: Do he and Anniston break up?
user1: They actually announce their engagement on live television.
user2: Thanks for the info on the movie.  I will probably watch it now.
user2: Take care!
user1: You too!

conversation:
user1: Hello there!
user2: Hi! 
user1: I love me a good comedy, how about you?
user2: I do too! Bruce Almighty was hilarious
user1: Yes it was, he doesn't disappointed, I love his movies, including Dick and Jane and Truman Show!
user1: also has quite a few other big name actors and actresses like Freeman and Aniston!
user2: Fun with Dick and Jane is one of his best in my opinion.
user1: he is talented for sure, like to get into character
user2: I loved his role in Bruce Almighty, though.   Morgan Freeman was excellent as usual,too.

conversation:
user2: hey

user1: I want to tell you about Bruce Almighty!  Have you seen it?  It's pretty funny
user2: no, I haven't seen it
user1: Oh, you should check it out.. it's about this newscaster played by Jim Carrey.  He gets all mad cause he's life is going badly and blames God for everything.. 
user1: So, god (Morgan Freeman) shows up and let's Jim's char be good for a week..
user2: sounds like a great plot
user2: who else is in the movie
user1: Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter
user1: And that one guy that used to be on the daily show.. can't recall his name off-hand..
user1: Steve Carell!  I think...
user2: yeah, Jennifer Anniston, gotta be good
user2: Steve Carell is funny
user2: when was it made?
user1: Yeah, especially like him in Dan In Real Life
user1: 2003 wow.. it's been nearly 15 years..
user1: God, I feel old
user2: That was a long time ago!
user2: Is it in HD?
user1: Hehe.. know you're making me feel old!
user1: I think so... they got it on blue ray for sure
user2: that's good, I don't think I could watch it if it wasn't
user2: We are so spoiled on digital media
user2: How long is the movie?
user1: Funny scene, he starts using his power to earn his job back, like discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body while covering a boring story on police dog training...
user2: That's hilarious!
user1: Hmm.. think about an hour and half.. not sure though..
user2: I'll have to check it out
user2: good talking to you
user1: yeah, you too!
user1: you have a good day!
user2: you too!
user2: I think this task is almost finished
user1: strangly enough, it only got a 48 on rotten tomatoes, but you can't always rely on critics..
user2: we need a couple more responses

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: Hi
user2: We're going to be talking about Bruce Almighty, right?
user1: I don't know, I didn't get the script.
user1: But as you say we may start
user2: We will :)
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: Yes, I have.
user1: Have you seen?
user2: Yes, it's a pretty good movie
user2: I think Jim Carrey shines
user1: Yup me too. 
user1: Remind me who was the other hero?
user2: Morgan Freeman?
user1: I think so.
user1: He's a great actor too. Don't you think?
user2: Absolutely
user1: What did you like about the movie?
user1: Which part the most you liked?
user2: I like that the comedic timing is so spot on, it's very enjoyable
user1: Yes, it is.
user2: I pretty much enjoyed it from beginning to end
user1: /What was the name of the heroine
user1: ?\
user2: Grace COnnelly
user1: Okay
user2: It only has a score of 48% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is pretty surprising
user2: I thought more people liked it
user1: do you think it was a very different concept?
user2: What do you mean by that?
user1: The story was very different
user2: No, I don't think so
user2: I really liked how Bruce used his powers
user1: Yeah, me too
user2: Well, thanks for talking with me about this movie
user1: I felt no one other than Jim carrie could be perfect for that role, don't you think?
user2: I definitely agree
user1: Okay, thanks for talking with me about this movie. see ya!!
user2: Seeya!

conversation:
user2: The new movie is Bruce almity it’s a comedy we are talking about 
user2: It stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Almity
user2: Morgan freeman plays god 
user1: It also stars Jennifer Aniston as Grace Connelly
user1: Rotten Tomatoes has given Bruce Almighty a score of 48%
user2: Yes and Lisa Ann as debbie
user2: That’s not a great score for that 
user1: And only a 46 from Metacritic.  Also not a great score. 
user2: Jim Carrey is funny a great comedian in it 
user2: Yes that score is low I thought the movie was fun 
user2: One of his best films by far he is a free spirit in it 
user2: What do you think of Jim Carrey 
user2: His character is a funny new reporter 
user1: Carrey is a great comedian, and he was great in this movie
user2: Dream My of becoming a news anchor one day 
user2: Philip baker plays jack he was good too 
user1: The movie was directed by Tom Shadyac.  He did a great job. 
user2: Yes he did a great job 
user2: Morgan freeman has such range he played god and did a good job 
user1: Steve Carell is also in the movie as Jim Carrey's rival.  
user2: Steve is a funny man I like him In the office better then this movie too 
user1: Catherine Bell placed his second love interest in the movie, in additional to Jennifer Aniston.
user2: It’s funny when Jim Carrey takes over being god for one week 
user2: Oh I didn’t realize Catherine bell wasn’t in this movie too 
user2: He plays a down on his luck reporter what a change as the movie goes on 
user1: Well he gets to be God, so I guess that would change anyone
user2: He is a television filed reporter for news anchor one 
user1: Bruce created that email system to deal with all the prayers he received. Pretty smart. 
user2: Cinema score was a a surprising since all the other scores wereso low 
user1: All those voices in his head, having to be God, must have been a lot to hanlde
user2: His breaking point was when he was passed over for that promotion
user2: There was so many slapstick scenes 
user1: But he was able to fix that once he was God
user2: Yes he did a great job making you believe that 
user2: Steve stole his news story when he got passed for his promotion 
user1: Not surprised he ended up fixing things with Grace (Jennifer Aniston) in the end.  Maybe a little too sweet but an effective ending. 
user2: Grace breaks up with him only to see the real him at then end 
user2: He spends a lot of time complaining to god too
user2: This show was made in 2003 that was really long ago 
user1: He is a much better reporter in the end, having experienced "God"
user2: Yes he was bogged down too muc
user2: He was bogged down a lot 
user1: And the homeless man in the end was God
user1: That was a surprise

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello
user2: Have you seen Bruce Almighty? I did and it is fantastic. Jim Carrey is hilarius but Freeman takes the show with his presence. It is a nice team.

conversation:
user1: Good morning
user2: good morning
user2: do you like Jim carry as an actor?
user1: Why yes
user1: Watch what someday?
user2: because he made a very interesting movie " Bruce Almighty"
user2: you should watch this movie
user1: I know this movie, but I have not seen it in quite some time.
user2: critical responses towards it were great
user1: How great were they
user1: ?
user2: all of them mentioned how Jim Carrys performance was hilarious as one of his best movies
user1: I see. Who reviewed this movie?
user2: it has an A score at Cinemascore
user1: Did IMDb do a review? They are my typical go-to, along with Rotten Tomatoes
user2: no, I don't have this information
user1: I see... Well, could you refresh my memory a little as to what happens in the movie? Like I said, it has been a while since I last saw it.
user2: but Rotten Tomatoes rating was quite unfair 
user2: it was about Bruce (Jim Carrey) who found a away to use God's ( Morgan Freeman) powersto cause some events
user2: he was hearing voices of prayers in his head
user2: anfd tried to find a way to respond to them
user2: are you still interested?
user2: hello!

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hi. Have you seen this movie, Bruce Almighty?
user1: I don't think I have.
user1: is it any good?
user2: It's not a new movie, it was made in 2003, but if you like Jim Carrey you'll enjoy it.
user1: Oh yeah, I do like a few of Carrey's movies, what is it about?
user2: It's more like a slapstick comedy. He's a TV reporter who complains to the man above. So through the move, God (morgan freeman) lets him take over, basically.
user1: Oh nice, I like Morgan Freeman. cool he is in it, so it's comedy as usual? That't what Jim is best at!
user2: Yes, I remember the movie. What is funny is him playing God. He cannot keep up with all the requests God receives every day, every hour, etc.
user1: sounds entertaining for sure.
user1: How are the ratings?
user2: Well, Rotten Tomatoes gives it 48 percent and average 5.7/10 . CinemaScore A 
user1: kind of all over the place I guess, did you like it? what would you rate it?
user2: I liked it but I like him. Some of his movies I didn't care for but this one I did. He's just silly. Jennifer Aniston is in the movie also as his girlfriend.
user1: surprised never heard of it with freeman, carey, AND Aniston in it! 
user1: I like his movies as well especially Truman show.
user2: I've followed Carey since he started on the old show "In Living Color" as Fireman Bill. Had me rolling. 
user1: He is a good actor. How does it all end then? does he say I don't want to be god anymore ? lol
user2: He listens to "God" and learns to stop thinking God wasn't taking care of things. He saw firsthand. He also almost lost his girlfriend because he wanted to be top dog at his job so bad. 
user1: ah so kind of a movie about morals and being grateful for what you have?
user2: Exactly. What makes it funny is watching him for that one week when he knew he had the "power" and man did he use that power. The music that played with it was good too. 
user1: yeah I think I may have to look into it, must of missed it when it came out or was popular
user1: I would like to see what like to have that power lol
user2: Isn't it funny how we can miss out on movies sometimes. I was just checking netflix earlier and saw a couple of movies I hadn't seen.
user1: Yeah I like to check out redbox every so often online to see whats new and recent
user2: I check Redbox also once in awhile and they send me coupons. The one scene where Jim Carrey
user2: character trys to answer all the e-mails in the world that God gets. He couldn't keep up, it was crazy.
user1: oh thats funny, god getting emails! 
user2: His character is reporter Bruce Nolan, sounds so official doesn't it?
user1: very professional
user1: I loved jim in "dick and jane"
user2: I didn't see that movie. Who's that actor that played on "The Office" - well, i'm older so I forget. Bruce Nolan tries to flub up the desk anchor and boy he does, I had tears in my eyes. 
user1: oooh i know carrel?
user1: steve
user1: sounds like I will have to watch it for sure!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: I thought we were supposed to read a document about a movie
user2: Hi. This move stars Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston
user2: Apparently only I have the document. What would you like to know about this movie?
user1: I do love Jennifer Aniston, on the other hand Jim Carrey seems a little crazy these days.
user1: oh, okay
user1: Is it another romantic comedy?
user2: Somewhat. Morgan Freeman plays God and gives Jim Carrey the power to become God.
user1: oh, I don't think I ever saw that one, but it does sound familiar
user2: He was a news reporter who went kind of nuts because another reporter got the stories he wanted.
user1: Is it rated for the whole family though?
user1: Yeah, no, pretty sure I haven't watched it.
user2: I think its good for anyone over 10.
user1: What's the name of the movie?
user2: Bruce Almighty.
user1: Ah, yes, okay
user2: Jennifer Aniston breaks up with him because as God, he becomes a real jerk.
user2: He uses one of his powers to make her breasts bigger.
user1: hahaha
user1: okay, I think it would be fun to watch
user2: That part was funny. 
user2: It was a pretty good movie, so good that they end up making a spin-off from it.
user1: what's the spin-off?
user1: oh wait, did that one have Chris Rock?
user2: It's called Evan Almighty and Evan is the reporter who got the job that Jim Carrey wanted
user2: I dont think so.
user2: It does have Steve Carrell in it.
user1: Oh, okay, must have been thinking of another movie. 
user1: Well these two would be good watched back to back then. I guess that is all the info I needed.
user2: Hope you have a great day. Oh and another good part is when he uses his powers to find the body of Jimmy Hoffa.
user1: thanks for all the info
user1: and for doing the reading work :)
user2: You're welcome

conversation:
user2: Hey hows it going?
user1: Hey, goin' pretty good.

user1: Yeah? What was it called?
user2: It's called Bruce Almighty. It also stars Jennifer aniston and morgan freeman as God
user1: Oh yeah, I love that movie! Jim Carrey is so funny.
user2: its about jims character playing a news reporter and wants to become a news ancor someday. 
user1: What does Morgan Freeman do in it?
user2: its a real slapstick kind of movie i feel.
user1: Who is in the movie?
user2: well morgan freeman plays the role of God . jim carey tells god he isnt doing his job right
user1: What genre is it?
user2: Its a comedy. 
user2: also lisa ann walter is in the movie as well. and so is phillip baker
user1: Where does the main character live?
user2: He lives in Buffalo Newyork.
user1: Do you usually like comedies?
user2: I love comedies. nothing better than a good laugh 
user1: I liked the part of the movie when Bruce decides to say yes to every prayer.
user2: he tries to become a serious news anchor but the people he works with seeing him as too much of a comedic person so things really don't go his way.
user1: What's your favorite scene in the movie?
user2: I liked when he meg God for the first time.
user2: met
user1: The scene where Bruce takes Grace to dinner and doesn't propose is a pretty bad scene because it's a bummer.
user2: yeah it is a pretty sad part. 
user1: Did you like when Bruce prays for Grace to find a man that would make her happy?
user2: yeah that was nice but sad also. i liked when he talked to god. to me that was the best part. there were many parts that were great tho
user2: is bruce almighty a movie you would watch again?
user1: Yes, I've actually seen it multiple times.
user1: Do you think the Rotten Tomatoes rating is accurate?
user2: im sure by those people yes. but i never pay attention to ratings because ive loved movies what were 0% and hated movies that were 100%. its all personal preference lol
user1: The best part of the movie was Bruce proposing to Grace, in my opinion.
user2: taht was a good scene. i liked when he discovered the body of jimmy hoffa  and thats what earned him his job back
user2: after he got his job back he embraced his comedic field and he loved it

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi.  Bruce Almighty is the movie we will be talking about.  It is a comedy starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman.
user1: Have you seen this movie before?  I have seen this back when it first came out!
user2: I have.  It's very funny. Carrey is hilarious and I love Morgan Freeman.
user1: Yes, Jim Carrey was much more hilarious back in the days.  Morgan Freeman will always be the sound of "God" to me.
user1: Would you rewatch the movie?
user2: Honestly.  I love Freeman's voice.  Jennifer Anniston was also very good.  But I did feel sorry for her character.
user2: Yes, Bruce Almighty is one of my go-to movies.
user2: The cinemascore for this movie is an A.  I'm not surprised at all to hear that.  All of the actors did a fabulous job.
user1: Yes I feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her Friends days.
user1: I do not think I would rewatch this movie.
user2: Yes, I agree that her character was very much a Friends style role.'
user2: Oh??  Why not?  Do you not like comedies?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes has a rotten score for it, so I think i am swayed by that.
user2: Oh but the CinemaScore is an A.
user1: Comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that I have favored in awhile.
user2: Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.
user1: Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles
user1: However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years
user2: Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.
user2: And Jim Carrey has bombed in so many.  But he outdid himself in this movie.
user1: It seems like I will have to rewatch it in the end.  
user2: I like how he uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events'
user2: I don't like how he embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character Evan was such an ass.
user1: Lol, very true.  It sure makes the situation crazier that it should be 
user2: I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'
user1: Likewise, I kind of wish I had his powers so I could do the same lol
user2: And of course, God  (Morgan Freeman) steps in to save the day and tells Bruce what he should do.
user1: Seriously!  Did you know it knocked off The Matrix Reloaded from the box office during its first week?
user2: Noooo I didn't know that.  I enjoyed the first Matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the  hit the first one was.  Saying that I can see why it knocked it out of it's place.
user2: When it all comes down to it, this is one of my favorite movies.  I'm not a big movie fan but this is one I can rewatch many times.
user1: True that.  Pretty impressive for Jim Carrey's career!  I hope you didn't watch Evan Almighty lol

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user2: I haven't seen Bruce Almighty for some reason, but I do love Jim Carrey.
user1: I haven't seen this one either, but I have heard that it is pretty funny.
user2: It's a pretty great idea. I'm sure it's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but he is really funny and so is Morgan Freeman.
user2: Jennifer Aniston annoys me a little though, I gotta say
user1: I really do like Morgan Freeman, most of his movies are good. I think I might have to check this one out.
user2: I look at Rotten Tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though, and 48% is pretty low. It has been out for a while, though.
user1:  I don't know why, but she has annoyed me through the years too. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, I just don't really like her very much.
user1:  Yes, it has been out for quite some time. Maybe it's on Netflix.
user2: Do you like comedies like this, or are you more into dramas?
user1:  My favorite movie genre is science fiction, but I do like a good comedy, or a good drama. If it's a good movie, I really don't care what genre it is.
user2: That's true. The first review under the "critical response" section is pretty harsh. I'm not sure I really ever read or care about movie reviews, just the ratings % online
user1:  When looking at movie reviews, I put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then I do official critics.
user2: True. Looking at the Key Scenes, I feel like the plot might have been a little paint-by-numbers and relying on Jim Carrey's personality too much, which is probably why it wasn't better recieved.
user1:  Yes, I can I didn't get that impression.
user1:  Sorry, this is supposed to say that I did get that impression.
user2: I guess that's part of his appeal, he can take any kind of material and make it funny. Also Steve Carrell is a great, funny actor too and I can see him being a good villian.
user1:  Yes, he is pretty good in everything he does.
user2: I haven't even heard of Metacritic or CinemaScore, to be honest. But it's weird that it's 46/100 on Metacritic and and A on CinemaScore. Those are pretty different scores.
user1:  That's true, I'm not sure how they score these things.
user2: The part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply "yes" is pretty funny and says a lot about religion.
user1:  Sounds pretty funny, I will have to put it on my list.
user2: I do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with Jimmy Hoffa's body sound cheesy. I'm not sure!
user1:  I agree with that statement.
user2: I do think if I had the power of being God I'd use it for better things!
user1:  For sure!
user2: Interesting. I mean, the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard.
user1:  I agree, however, it might be worth a watch.
user2: The best part of the movie is probably the middle section where he's testing out all of his powers. Seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description.
user1:  I'm not the hugest Jim Carrey fan, but I'll give it a try.
user2: Yeah I think he is so out-there that this is a perfect film for him.
user1:  Yeah, he always seems to play some crazy out-of-control guy.

conversation:
user1: Hi, do you like Jim Carrey movies?
user1: I know of a great movie starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman
user2: hey sure i do , hes an amazingly funny actor!
user2: whats the movie?
user1: Bruce Almighty
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: i actually have not
user2: can you give me a brief description of it?
user1: Jennifer Aniston is in it as well as Bruce's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman plays the part of God, and Carrey plays Bruce. Bruce is unhappy with the way God is handling things and is given a chance to do God's job.
user2: oh my the plot sounds amazing 
user2: do you know when the movie was released?
user1: It came out in 2003.
user2: is there any good reviews regarding the movie?
user1: Bruce has dreams of being a news anchor
user2: was it rated on imdb?
user1: It has been called one of Jim Carrey's best films
user1: It received a cinema score of A
user2: but can you tell me the rating for the movie on imdb?
user2: or maybe the rating given by rotten tomatoes?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it 48& and average of 5.7/10. I am not sure about IMDB
user2: oh
user2: can i ask do you know where the movie was filmed?
user1: It takes place in Buffalo, NY where Bruce wants to be a news anchor but gets skipped over for a promotion. That's the point where he loses it.
user2: oh my
user2: any other actors of significant importance in this movie?
user1: He blames God and God offers him the chance to see what it is like being him. Bruce goes on to abuse his powers and the comedy ensues.
user2: has it recieved any awards ?
user1: Steve Carrell plays Bruce's nemesis at the TV station and Catherine bell is a coworker he has a mild cruch on.
user2: do bruce and catherine get closer as the movie goes on?
user1: No, eventually Bruce gets engaged to his girlfriend Grace, played by Jennifer Aniston.
user2: what a man!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello
user2: how's it going?
user2: have you seen any good movies?
user1: Good. you?
user2: pretty good. 
user1: Yes, Bruce Almighty.
user1: You?
user2: I haven't seen it recently but I enjoyed it when it came out
user2: does it still hold up
user1: Early 2000's Jim Carrey is better than present day Jim Carrey lol. I liked his performance in this movie. 
user2: yeah, he wasn't as over the top as the 90's carrey.
user2: I remember thinking he seems like a real person
user2: who played God again? I want to say Morgan Freeman
user1: I think it's strange that his girlfriend is Jennifer Aniston in this movie, but he had a crush on someone else. Get real. lol
user1: Yes.
user2: yeah seriously 
user2: I also though he was kind of a dick to Evan
user2: although I found it hilarious when I was younger
user1: He was!!! I agree. Now that I'm an adult and I see that I'm like WTF. NO.
user2: yeah, If I knew a coworker was acting like either of those straight to HR lol I guess adulthood made me boring 
user2: I'm surprised to see it has a 47% on rotten tomatoes 
user1: I couldn't enjoy getting a promotion if it involved ruining someone elses life. especially if It was because I embarrassed them at work in front of everyone.
user1: and a 5.7 lol I always wonder who rates these things 
user2: yeah, I never really looked into the process but I think it's user rated. Metacritic is the ave of different critics, still has a 46/100 
user1: I never trust those
user2: yeah, grain of salt. I'll always watch a movie that looks good to me 
user1: He's a jerk to Grace too
user1: She was too good for him lol
user2: I know he's constantly taking everything out on her.  
user2: She should have left him for good
user2: If my SO blamed me for the dog peeing on the couch, I'm out 
user2: Then again I have a low tolerance 
user1: YES I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A DOG THAT PISSED ME OFF
user1: hahah! I couldn't remember
user2: Lol!
user2: Yeah they got a new puppy and it wasn't house broken
user1: Its nice how they end up happy and then they have the stereotypical "crazy" homeless man at the end. Eye roll. 
user2: Yeah, cheesy ending but it was PG rated what can you do 
user2: This has been fun! Maybe I'll talk to you again. Have a good day/night!. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi! I just watched the movie "Bruce Almighty." Have you seen it?
user2: I've seen it a long time ago!
user2: But I don't think I enjoyed it that much tbh
user2: What did you think of it?
user1: Who was your favorite actor in it? I personally loved Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God?
user1: I found it to be a really great and funny movie!
user2: I did like Morgan Freeman!
user2: But I also like him in every role he plays
user2: I think all the actors were pretty good overall
user1: Yes Morgan Freeman is always a great actor.
user1: I think his costar Lisa Ann Walter was good as well. She totally owned many of the scenes that she was in!
user2: She was! I also like Jennifer Aniston. She's always done well in comedies
user1: Yes she's always a great actress!
user1: I think the reviewers had the right idea of the comedic possibilities of this movie.
user2: Yeah this movie was pretty creative in a way
user1: The idea behind it really was great. And I loved the way the Bruce helped out his friends.
user2: I wonder how what people would think of it if the movie came out recently versus 2003
user1: Well I think it'd really have the same story so it probably would be just about as popular... Maybe there would be changes in some actors but that shouldn't have too big of an affect on its popularity.
user2: I don't think it would be as popular, just because we've seen so many similar comedies come out since then
user2: I'm also curious as to how people would react to the "God" theme now
user1: I can't really think of many similar comedies myself. I'm sure some have been done but I'm guessing this was probably the ineptus of them so this actually would be original.
user1: Well it wasn't a serious religious movie so I'm guessing people would be ok with it. Although it feels like there's been quite a bit of religious tension going on lately so maybe it would be less popular than I'm thinking.
user2: very true
user2: Actually now that I think of it, this was a pretty good movie. I think I'm just a bit cynical over slapstick comedies
user1: I loved the scenes towards the beginning where he's having mischievous fun with all of his new found powers. That reminds me of how most people probably would really react. Or least how they fantasize about it.
user2: I liked the twist at the end about that homeless guy. It was a cute end for the movie
user2: I completely forgot Steve Carell was in this. He was perfect for his role
user1: Yes that was hilarious! It was full of twists and turns.
user1: Thinking about it a bit more there was a bit more praying in this movie than I might except in a mainstream movie about mainstream people.
user2: I'm glad the movie had a happy ending. Of course I wasn't expecting anything else but it was still nice
user2: Yeah I think the way they went about religion and prayers in this would be much different if it came out today
user1: Well most movies do have happy endings but that's so trite and boring. Still it does bring a smile to my face and make me feel a bit good that everyone's still happy.
user1: It would be really interesting to see how different it would be 15 years later. Lots of things have changed in that time. But good comedy is still good comedy!
user2: I like that these sort of movie always have a good message. Even if it's one as simple as "be happy with what you have"
user2: Thank you for your time! Have a nice day!
user1: Lol yeah feel good movies are fun. They do always lift up my spirits!

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you watched this movie

user2: Yes, i agree!
user2: I love the cast 
user1: I will watch ANYTHING with him in it! I know it is going to have me falling out of my seat lol
user2: yup, same here
user2: I can't believe ratings are so low
user2: rotten tomatoes 48%
user1: Why do you think they rated it super low. I don't know anyone who did not enjoy it. 
user2: I honestly have no idea. The cast is awesome, the movie is unique, interesting and hilarious\
user1: It also received a Metacritic score of 46/100. Wow....I would think it would be higher than that!
user2: I know!
user1: Super hilarious! I could not stop laughing. 
user2: What do you think about critics responses
user1: But the Cinema Score is A! People enjoyed it. But it looks as if the producers did not expect it to do well at all.
user2: I feel like one of the critics was rude :( 
user1: The part about Bruce making Evan act crazy while he was shooting a live news cast was complete hilarious! That was the best part.
user1: Extremely. They must be missing their funny bone!
user2: I agree
user2: Carrey is very talented
user1: Wow. One said he "probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" that was extremely rude and also unprofessional to say. Even if it was just a critic. 
user2: I loved when he was trying to make a romantic date night and pulled the moon lol
user1: Yesss lol
user2: I know!! That comment made me mad! 
user1: O yes. Now the scene where "God" (Morgan Freeman) comes in lol. Loved the part with the file cabinet 
user1: Me too!!
user2: Jim Carrey is a better actor than most of the actors nowadays
user2: Yup :)

user2: I sure do, what about fan based reviews? 
user1: It is a fan favorite
user2: Jim's movies usually are. whats the plot?
user1: Carrey's character is a new reporter and has a run of bad luck.  He blames God who it turn gives him the power he posses, which brings a whole new host of good and bad things.
user2: Oh, I bet that could get interesting. so Jim carrey's charachter has all the powers of god? thats crazy!
user1: It really is, he has some great back and forth with Jennifer Aniston
user2: I always liked Jennifer Aniston.
user1: She is good in this movie too, great range as an actor
user2: does she still look great in this movie?
user1: Always does
user2: anything else particularly interesting about the film?
user1: There is a great scene where he is hearing prayers from people in his head and he does not know what to do.  God shows up and tells him he has to answer them, so he makes a computer with email and starts answering.  It gets to be to much and he just replies to all with YES
user2: haha, not all prayers deserve to be answered, hilarious!
user1: right.  there is another scene where Bruce (Carrey's character) has had enough and tells God he is done.  He gets hit by a bus and dies.  God asks him what he wants and says he wants Grace (Aniston's character) to be happy.  God sends Bruce back and they get engaged.
user2: Oh my, I think my girlfriend would like that scene, seems kinda corny to me.  
user2: typical happy ending.
user1: Very true, always happens that way
user2: Does he get hit by a bus on accident?
user1: Yes, he knees down in the street
user2: oh thats a relief
