Roberts Blossom as Marley

critical response:
the film's first half is 'flat and unsurprising as its cute little premise suggests', the second half is praised for its slapstick humor. The conversation between Kevin and Marley, as well as the film's final scenes, is also praised.
He compared the elaborate booby-traps in the film to Rube Goldberg machines, writing 'they're the kinds of traps that any 8-year-old could devise, if he had a budget of tens of thousands of dollars and the assistance of a crew of movie special effects people' and criticized the plot as 'so implausible that it makes it hard for [him] to really care about the plight of the kid [Kevin]
sadistic festival of adult-bashing'.

description:
The McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home outside of Chicago on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, eight-year-old Kevin, is being ridiculed by his siblings and cousins. A fight with his older brother, Buzz, results in Kevin getting sent to the third floor of the house for punishment, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to power lines, which causes a temporary power outage and resets the alarm clocks, causing the entire family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind. 
Kate discovers mid-flight that Kevin is missing and, upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked. Peter and the rest of the family go to his brother Rob's apartment in the city while Kate manages to get a flight back to the United States, only to get as far as Scranton, Pennsylvania. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to Chicago on their way to Milwaukee in a moving van, which she graciously accepts. 
Kevin returns home and rigs the house with numerous booby traps. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin around the house, he calls the police and flees the house, luring the duo into a neighboring vacant home. Harry and Marv manage to catch him and discuss how they will get their revenge, but Marley sneaks in and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel before they can do anything to Kevin. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses they burgled due to the latter's habit of flooding them. On Christmas Day, Kevin is disappointed to find that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house and call for him; they reconcile and are soon joined by the rest of the McCallisters, who waited in Paris until they could get a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's missing gold tooth. Kevin then observes Marley reuniting with his son and his family. Marley notices Kevin and the pair wave to each other before Marley and his family go inside his house. Buzz suddenly calls out, 'Kevin, what did you do to my room?!' at which point Kevin runs off.

user1: Oh, ok. Is he able to fend for himself at all?
user2: kevin is left home because a power outage caused the family to oversleep and be late for their flight so in the confusion they misplaced kevin as he was sent to the attic for misbehaving the night before 
user1: So, he is not able to fend for himself?  Is he afraid?
user2: he enjoys being alone but he is met with two burglers who he has to try and strop 
user2: he is not afriad but more excited
user1: How does he stop the burglars?
user1: Is it a drama or more of a comedy?
user2: the movie is a good mix of both but i would say it is more of a drama that has a good laugh once in a while 
user1: What is  the name  of the movie?
user2: the movie is named home alone 
user1: Ok. Does Kevin have any siblings?

user2: no Kevin has to fend off the burgers himself he places booby traps all around the house which turn out to be very effective
user1: Do the burglars realize they are being  fooled by a kid that is  home alaonee?
user1: Do they give up or  keep trying  to rob the house?

conversation:
user1: I love home alone when it came it, great movie!
user2: Oh yes. I enjoyed watching it with my family growing up.
user1: it was hilarious how macaulay culkin got the crooks so many time 
user2: Yes. He's a clever boy. I wouldn't have been able to think of half the tricks

conversation:
user2: I remember seeing this movie as a child and thought it was very funny
user1: I also saw the movie as a kid.  I remember it being funny.
user2: Watching it as an adult now you see it from a different perspective
user1: what do you think the critic means by saying "sadistic festival of adult bashing"?   It would be a different perspective, but I still think it would be funny, dont you?
user2: I read that also and don't really get it either.  I still find it funny and don't see it as adult bashing.  What are your thoughts?
user1: I don't see it as adult bashing.  Maybe I forgot some parts.  But I could see it happening. accidents do happen.  
user2: When you have that big of a family it definitely could happen.  I do agree with the first critic saying the first half is flat.  I remember it taking a bit to become funny.  All the funny parts are the pranks he plays on the robbers
user1: Yes, I agree!  Do you remember who Marley was? Played by Roberts Blossom?  I don't remember that character.4
user2: Was he the old guy that lived next door that they kids were all freaked out by?  
user1: Maybe, I don't really remember that part. 
user2: Did the story just change on the side
user1: I don't think mine did yet.
user1: Yes it did
user2: Ok sorry mine looked as though it did but its the same story. 
user2: I think the description up top got longer
user1: I think maybe the top part, the key scene changed?
user1: now another key scene was added.
user2: Yes it added a second key scene.  The one where Kate realizes he is missing and tries to get a flight home
user1: I see that.  I didn't remember that was the moms name even.  I better rewatch it and refresh my memory. 
user2: I saw it a few years ago again.  Its a fun Christmas movie.  I remember Gus the polka band player was played by John Candy
user1: It makes me want to watch it again.  How many did they make?  Three?
user2: I think you are right that there are 3.  I never saw the other 2.  Usually remakes are not that good.
user1: I agree.  I think I saw all of them, but I don't remember them that well.  I'm even thinking the last one wasn't the same characters, but I could be wrong. 
user2: Plus how many times are you going to leave your kid behind. I see they added another scene.  How the robbers got caught and Kevin reuniting with his mom and family
user1: That is a good part of the movie.  I can't imagine how the mom felt.  
user2: I can't either.  She probably felt horrible.  Funny how she fought to get a flight home and didn't want to wait but her family made it back the same exact time.
user1: Yes!  
user2: By reading the last seen Marley is the old neighbor guy.  Everyone thought he was scary but Kevin helped him reunited with his son and granddaghter
user1: That makes sense.  I just didn't remember that being his name.  I have a neighbor named Marley too.  But she is young and a girl. lol
user2: I just remembered they called him Old Man Marley and thought he killed someone and buried him.  He was always outside shoveling and had a garbage can with him. 
user2: How do we know when this task is complete?
user1: Funny.  Good message of how looks can be deceiving.    And I don't know.  Do we hit the finish conversation button at the bottom?  Or will be direct us when finished?
user1: On the m turk it says will take about twenty minutes.  It is going on 30.  It says you have to talk 12 times, which I am sure we did
user2: That is true.  I just saw at the top of my document it says this is the end of the document and now the finish conversation button can be clicked.  I looked back at the instructions too and saw that.  I think we are good and can click finish.  Thank you
user1: same here.  Thank you also.  bye

user1: Hello there
user1: What's the name of the movie?
user2: Hi there!  The movie we're talking about is Home Alone.
user1: Alright. What's it about?
user2: It's about a boy who is left behind when his family goes on vacation.  Some robbers try to break in and he has to deal with them.
user1: Oh no Poor kid
user1: Is this movie entertaining to both kids and adults
user2: It doesn't seem like a very good movie, the scores are all pretty low and the critics have a lot of negative things to say about it.
user1: Huh interesting
user1: Did they say why they didn't like it?
user2: They said it was kind of flat and sort of gimmicky.  Some of the humor is supposed to be good though.
user1: I see. What does the kid do when the burglars break in?
user2: One of the critics says that there are a bunch of sadistic booby traps that seem kind of implausible.
user1: Hmm sadistic booby traps. 
user1: What is the kids name?
user2: His name is Kevin, and apparently the kid gets left behind because the family overslept on the day of their flight and had to rush to the airport.
user1: I wonder how any family forgets one of their kids haha. 
user1: Do they realize they forgot him?
user2: Well there was a power outage that reset all the clocks, so that made them have to rush and not notice he was missing.
user1: How many kids do they have?
user2: Well there's Kevin, the youngest, and his older brother Buzz, who he gets in a fight with.
user1: Does Kevin reunite with his family eventually?
user2: I'm not sure.  The mom finds out he's missing on the plane to Paris, and then has to fly back part of the way and then hitchhike back home.
user1: Does Kevin get rid of the robbers eventually?
user2: I'm not sure, I just know that Kevin's traps for them are pretty nasty.  One of the critics said it was a "Festival of adult bashing".
user1: Does it mention anything about the amount of money the movie made?
user2: Nope, but it only has a 62% on rotten tomatoes so I would assume it didn't do very well.
user1: Does it mention if there are any sequels made?
user2: I don't see anything about a sequel. The movie came out in 1990 so it's pretty old now.
user1: What actors are a part of the cast?
user2: The cast is Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Roberts Blossom.
user1: Those are some good actors
user1: Which ones play the robbers?
user2: The robbers are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, and their character names are Harry and Marv.

user1: oh, i only see one document on home alone 
user2: we messed up we only get 3 replies each page.... i think it was an epic movie! lol kevin is my fav character and i think its not fair to call it adult bashing that sounds like a response from a parent whos kid beats their ass lol at the bottom click tasks thats where i found that 
user1: john hughes was the director , right ?
user1: i didnt like the adult bashing comment either, i didnt see that. they were robbers
user2: scroll to the bottom of the document... and at the bottom of this chat box it says tasks.... we get 3 chat responses each page we are shown.... 
user1: ooohhh
user2: see u said ohhh but u didnt add something about the movie.. u wasnted your response lol i hope we still get paid ;lollol side note the mcallister family missed their wake up call bc th epower went out i never caught that in the movie. 
user1: Did you agree with the rotten tomatoes rating of the movie?
user2: not at all. id give the movie a 10/10 its something i was raised on lol my mom used to put it on to shut me up
user2: the document says its not realistic bc kevin would need tons of money to set those traps... i think thats bs.. his family DOES have money lollolol everything he used he had laying around his parents giant house 
user1: Right, i did not agree that they were traps that any 8 year old could come up with. not at all in my opinion
user1: Did you like that the movie had a Christmas theme?
user1: i also like the scene where Kevin slaps his cheeks with the after shave and then screams because it was so unexpected and hilarious
user2: thats true. i dont think an 8 year old would come up with those but i dont think he would have "needed his own money" either i think xmas was perfect they were traveling for the holidays.. i prefer the other one tho where hes stuck in NYC 
user2: home alone is a 1990 film! i was born in 1990 lol NOW I FEEL OLD 
user1: lol....yes home alone is a 1990 film and i was 15
user2: Kate discovers mid-flight that Kevin is missing, how stupid llolol made for a funny movie but how can you forget a kid at home lol 
user1: I know...i was just thinking about that too, how they had to rush around in the movie because they overslept, and then just counted heads and thought they had kevin. i cant imagine having that many kids that i could ever forget one 
user2: you were 15 lollollol omg i was born in feb of 1990 -with two would-be burglars played by Joe Pesci and DanielStern. i think they were perfect for the part! hysterical 
user1: i was just about to say something about the actors who played the burglars....i really enjoyed Joe Pesci character in the movie. 
user1: i do not agree that the first half was flat either. i think it was a great movie from beginning to end

conversation:
user2: Hi! So what did you think of the 1990 comedy Home Alone?
user1: Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did.
user2: Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film?
user1: Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men.
user2: Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well!
user1: Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be.
user2: Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half "flat and unsurprising".
user1: Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it
user2: I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990! 
user1: I like the quote "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright.
user2: That is true! Ha! Pesci and Stern did a great job acting the part as adults who weren't very bright! John Hughes wrote the movie perfectly!
user1: I related to the character Kevin being made fun of  by his family since kids deal with that all the time. The part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me.
user2: Same here! I honestly felt bad for Kevin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind. Like you, i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it.
user1: I wonder what kind of job Kevin's dad worked that he could afford to fly that many people to Paris for christmas. I blame him for all of this!
user2: That is true! And plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure.
user1: How much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being. I guess nobody in the McCallister family was an early bird either. Alarms didn't always exist.
user2: No kidding! I wonder that as well! Then they don't even realize he's missing until Kate discovered it during the middle of their flight. So awful!
user1: I couldn't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band. I found that part very funny.
user2: Same here - and in a moving van at that. That was incredibly hilarious!
user1: Imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip. That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.
user2: I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!
user1: For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.
user2: Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!
user1: Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.
user2: You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!
user1: I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.
user2: It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.
user1: I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone. I would figure the police might be interested to talk to Kevin's parents.
user2: I agree but it was hilarious when Buzz yelled "Kevin what did you do to me room?" and Kevin ran off at the end. I enjoyed discussing Home Alone with you today!

conversation:
user2: Hi, what movie did you see? :)
user1: Home Alone
user2: Oh cool, how was it?
user1: The storyline was smooth and the comedy was on point.\
user2: Nice.  Who was in it?
user1: Macaulay Culkin, which is the main character but the shining light of this movie is the team of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the burglars.
user1: Hello?
user2: Oh nice.  Anyone else famous in it?
user1: John Heard is the father.
user2: Who plays his mom?
user1: Catherine O'Hara
user1: They are barely in the movie
user2: Oh okay.  I like her.
user2: So what is the movie about
user1: The family leaves their 8 year old son at home when they went on Christmas vacation and he has to protect the house from burglars 
user2: Awww that sucks.  Is it a comedy?
user1: Yeah, mostly gag stuff but as I said burglars really have good reactions 
user2: Cool.  When did it come out?
user1: 1990
user2: Oh wow.  
user2: Can you tell me any key scenes?
user1: The scene where they discover they left kevin at home was great, as was the scene when kevin realized hes been left.
user2: Aww that sounds sad.  
user2: What did the critics say about the movie?
user2: Did it get good reviews?
user1: A first no, but it's a cult classic.
user2: Oh okay
user2: Are there any other memorable scenes
user1: The various scenes with the booty traps are the key of the movie, you'll remember each and every one.
user2: That sounds funny.
user2: Is this a kids movie? Or is funny for adults too?
user1: Yeah, I'm an adult and i found it funny, it's more enjoyable to watch with a kid though.
user2: Okay cool
user2: Does it have a happy ending
user1: Yes, but I don't want to spoil it.
user2: Okay, cool, well thanks for your help!

user2: hi

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello! How are you? Did you enjoy this movie?
user1: I did enjoy this moive!
user1: It got a decent score on rotten tomatoes. Had you seen it before?
user2: So did I! I think that the idea of a child somehow being left behind during a family vacation is great. I had seen it once before. Had you? 
user1: I have as well. Do you know who the cast is?
user2: The only name that I was familiar with is Macaulay Culkin. Was this a film of your childhood as it was for me?
user1: Yes it was!
user1: What do you think of the critical responses? True in your opinion?
user2: Would you have chosen to watch this movie based on its plot, even if the ratings weren't as decent as they are? 
user1: I might have chosen to watch it still Hard to say since it is one of my favorites
user2: I think that the ratings are unflattering for the most part. To me, this movie was enjoyable despite some of the rather negative reviews that it received, critically. 
user1: Did you realize that they lived in Chicago and not some other city?
user1: Also, I can't believe they actually left him behind.
user2: Did you feel very bad for Kevin getting left behind, or was the scenario in which that happened too funny to feel bad for him? Also, I did not realize that it was located in Chicago!
user2: Also, I can't believe that this movie is 28 years old. Wow!
user1: Now as an adult I feel bad for him, but as a kid I think I thought it was more silly than anything
user1: OMG it really is 28 years old!
user1: Funny that it was heavy winds that caused the power outage since Chicago is the windy city. They were smart with the setting.
user2: I agree. Reading the description of how it happened - that he was sent to the third floor for punishment - is sad! 
user2: That is smart. I didn't think of that.
user2: Do you think it is realistic that ALL flights to Chicago were booked?
user1: It's so sad that Kate, the mom, wasnt able to get a flight back
user1: I don't think it is very realistic. Especially with the weather you would think that at least one seat was open
user1: What are your thoughts on her riding in a can with strangers? I mean it was a nice group of men in a Polka Band but still.
user2: I agree. I guess it was the only thing that made sense for the premise of this movie. Did you notice that the director's name was Chris Columbus? 
user1: OMG no! That is hilarious hahaha poor guy
user2: I personally don't know if I would have felt comfortable doing that, but I also don't have kids at this time, so I suppose the must have been desperate! 
user1: Polinski, that is a very polish last name
user2: Yes I can't even imagine having the name Chris Columbus! What a funny coincidence. And that is quite Polish! I didn't think of that.
user1: It is always so sweet when Kevin's family finally gets home!
user1: Also when he rigs the house, that is great. Smart kid
user2: Yes, so sweet! I couldn't imagine being without my family on Christmas Day, so I bet he was happy. This movie is so funny. I love the robbers getting caught in the traps.
user2: Are you familiar with the Rube Goldberg machines that one of the critics mentioned? I can definitely see the likeness of his booby traps to those.
user1: No I didn't know what Rube Goldberg machines were.
user2: Do you normally prefer to watch comedy movies such as this, or do you have another preferred genre?
user1: I love when Marley comes in and knocks the robbers out.
user1: I watch this for Christmas every year, but in general it depends on my mood
user1: But I think we are all done with the movie stuff. Thanks for chatting with me about it.
user2: Thanks!

conversation:
user1: hello there
user2: HI THERE YOURSELF. HAVE YOU SEEN HOME ALONE?
user1: Of course I have.  Who hasn't?
user2: DIDN'T YOU THINK THAT MACCAULAY CULKIN WAS THE CUTEST EVER?
user1: Cute, not really.  But definitely well cast for the part.  Solid actor at that age.
user1: DO you have CAPS LOCK on intentionally?  I feel like you're yelling at me.
user2: SORRY, not yelling, I just prefer all CAPS.  I can adjust.
user2: Did you think the first or second half of the movie was better?
user1: Second half.
user1: More action.
user2: Why was that?
user2: Didn't see your whole answer.  What did you think of the booby traps?
user1: I like the paint cans in the face down the stairs
user2: Did you feel this movie was 'adult bashing'?
user1: not in the slightest
user1: are you going to ask more questions, or tell me more about the film?
user2: Why not?  The adults were portrayed and treated badly.
user1: Lol. They were thieves...
user1: It's part of the point of the film. 
user2: The parents weren't portrayed as particularly 'bright' people.  Caring, but not bright.
user1: Typical of many parents, more concerned with their wealth and vacation than their children
user1: Again their neglectful nature is what set the plot into motion
user1: It's a film, it's meant to be exaggerated...
user1: I believe you're supposed to talk more about specific plot points, (What's happening in the movie) as each of the new parts come up for you on the screen
user1: you haven't been doing this...
user2: I can tell this movie is a favorite of yours.  How many times have you seen it?
user1: 5
user2: What was your favorite scene in the movie and why?
user1: The paint cans in the face down the stairs
user1: just humorous in general
user2: Still with me?
user1: yes

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: How are you?
user2: Is anyone online?
user1: Hi, sorry I was reading the info. Have you ever seen the movie Home Alone?
user1: It's a comedy from 1990 staring Macaulay Culkin.
user2: yes, I have seen home alone
user2: its great
user2: for some reason the info isn't showing up for me. All i am seeing is this chat window
user2: The home alone page isn't showing up for me
user1: I think I'll just tell you what I know about it. Is that okay?
user2: sounds great

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: Hey! So Home alone!?!
user2: Yup.
user2: Funny movie.
user2: Did you see it?
user1: Yea, it was great, although it only had a 62% on rotten tomatoes
user2: I like Joe Pesci
user2: It's nice to see him not a gangster
user1: Yeah, hes a great actor 
user2: John Hughes wrote this
user2: Weird he didn't direct a movie he wrote
user1: It was directed by Chris Columbus. He did some awesome film work!
user2: I thought the scenes with the two robbers were the funniest
user1: I liked the scene where Kevin threw the paint buckets down the stairs and hit Marv
user2: I like most of those type scenes
user2: Hard to believe parents would forget their kid, though
user1: Yeah, crazy that the alarms never went off, that's happened to me before!
user2: Your parents left you home alone?
user1: Its also crazy how an 8 year old could rig those types of traps
user2: yeah
user1: Not to the extent of the movie, but I've overslept before 
user2: Catherine O'hara
user2: Haven't seen her in much lately
user1: Me neither.
user2: good actress though
user1: Its funny how they got to Scranton, PA. I was just watching the Office earlier
user2: great show
user1: yeah shes talented
user2: love Dwight throwing the sword out the window when the cops pull him over
user2: and his office supplies in jello
user1: HAHA right!
user1: great show!
user2: Didn't like it as much when Michael left
user1: He IS the show
user2: totally
user2: Jim and Pam are a great couple though
user1: I ship them
user2: hah
user2: So, home alone was 1990
user2: Long time ago
user1: yes, old but gold
user2: I might have seen it at the theatre
user1: I saw it on DVD

conversation:
user1: Hi there! happy Wednesday!
user2: hi, happy spring!\
user2: have you ever seen home alone?
user1: wow the one critic response is quite cynical. the second one. 
user1: yes, it's been a bit though in all honesty!
user1: have you seen it?
user2: oh yeah
user2: 'sadistic adult bashing' heh
user1: I think it was a decent movie for 1990. Family friendly for most part. 
user2: i loved it, you
user2: yeah me too
user1: I enjoyed Macaulay Culkin in it. he doesn't really have much else to his name. and I enjoyed Daniel Stern and John Heard in it
user2: 'flat and unsurprising' ugh
user1: I just think the whole plot of a huge family going to airport and not noticing someone missing , I think its quite clever myself!
user2: stern and heard haven't done anything since then, have they? 
user1: Just home alone 2 for Stern.  he probably made decent amount off those two movies alone
user2: 'pulling our stings' implying that's a bad thing
user1: Heard died last year
user2: oh no kidden
user1: I meant realistically once you get to paris and notice him missing you would send a neighbor or friend over to your house 
user2: hope that does not violate the terms of not talking about anything not on the page
user2: haha right, but it was a great fantasy
user1: yeah have to bend rules of reality sometimes when watching a movie I suppose
user1: His brother Buzz is funny too in the movie
user2: i forgot about buzz, he was hilarious 
user2: and what's wrong with rube goldberg
user2: ?
user2: wow rotten tomatoes 66%
user1: not sure i know who rube goldberg is. 
user1: yeah I wonder if thats ratings over time
user1: i bet in 1990 ratings were much higher
user2: cinema score, wonder that is
user1: im not to familiar with it, I use imdb and then rotten tomatoes sometimes
user2: i'd have to google it but i think he's a guy associated with these ridiculously complex machines
user1: oh I see , mentioned in  the critical response part
user1: lol ill google that too
user1: have a nice day!
user2: like a machine that's take 9 steps to do what it coule of done in one
user2: u2

conversation:
user2: Wow Home Alone, that's a film from the past.
user1: I've seen it a hundred times and still love it.
user2: For some reason Ive always thought it was a John Hughes movie. I forgot it was Chris Columbus.
user2: Oh Hughes wrote it, ok then.
user1: Joe Pesci was pretty hilarious in it for the character he played
user2: Yeah I liked those scenes the best.
user1: very different character from the other movies I've seen him in 
user2: Funny how it has become a classic, but the critics scores were pretty bad back then.
user1: I think those scores are for recent times, but the critical responses don't look too great
user1: 1990...we're getting old aren't we?
user2: Yeah it doesn't even seem that long ago.
user2: I think this plot actually happened in real life not long after the movie came out.
user1: I can imagine it happening a lot more nowadays 
user2: Kids would love it if this happened to them.
user2: Maybe the parents wouldn't mind either haha.
user1: yeah times have changed since then right?
user1: Buzz was quite a character :)
user2: I forgot the parents went to Paris. I thought it was New York.
user1: New York was the sequel 
user2: Oh ok!
user1: Gus Pollinski is screams John Hughes
user2: Yeah I miss John Hughes. He was a great writer and director.
user1: didn't know she ran into him at Scranton either. it's weird how after all these years still learning something new
user2: Yeah Scranton, soon to be famous because of The Office.
user1: John Hughes was the best
user1: yeah that's what I was thinking!
user2: The best part of this movie were the booby traps for the burglers.
user2: I remember they reminded me of the mouse trap game.
user1: those were always my favorite parts to watch growing up too
user1: again nowadays I think the traps would be so different...probably a lot crueler
user2: Yeah and the kid would be charged for hurting the burglers.
user2: Good talking to you, have a great day!
user1: you too!

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hi! We are discussing the movie HomeAlone.  
user1: Did you watch the movie?
user2: I did.  Home alone is the story of a little boy left behind by his family when they fly to Paris on their Christmas Vacation.  
user1: Oh!  Who played the little boy role?
user2: Macaulay Culkin played the role of Kevin. 
user1: Ok, Do you like the movie? And how he acted?
user2: The movie got a CinemaScore of A.  The movie has a lot of slapstick humor which got a lot of praise.  
user2: Kevin loves being home alone at first then 2 burglars show up and he has to defend his home.  
user2: That's where the slapstick humor comes in.  
user1: Ok, Who was your favorite character in the movie? Why?
user2: Kevin is one of my favorite.  I can relate to the fact that he is the youngest and always blamed for everything.  He wishes his family would disappear.  
user1: What part of the story told by the movie was the most powerful?
user2: The moment when Kevin wakes up and realizes his family was gone and he was accidentally left behind. 
user1: Did any of the characters in this movie make you angry?
user2: Kevin's brother Buzz is constantly ridiculing Kevin. Kevin gets in the fight with him and that's how he ends up in trouble.  It's also a big annoying that his parents actually managed to leave him there alone.  
user1: Did you come to respect any of the characters in this movie? Who was it and why did you come to respect that character?
user2: His mother was terrified when she realized he was gone.  She did everything she could to make it back to him with plenty of missteps along the way, but you could really see her love for him and fear.
user1: What did you like best about the movie?
user2: One funny thing was that his mom traveled with a traveling polka band on their moving van to get back to Kevin.  
user1: Would you watch it again? 
user2: I would.  I love John Hughes movies.  He wrote and produced this movie.  
user1: How popular is this film? because I never heard this movie...
user2: Pretty popular.  You may be more familiar with how Kevin handles the burglars.  He sets up a bunch of booby raps around the house to keep them out.  
user2: The burglars are played by Daniel Stern and Joe PEsci.
user1: No, I don't know Kevin.. Who is the director? Is him?
user2: The director is Chris Columbus.  The little boy is Kevin.  He set up all kinds of crazy booby traps around his house to keep the burglars out until the police arrive and arrest them.  
user1: When was the film made? 
user2: The film was made in 1990.
user1: Does this movie have part2?
user2: I believe it does.  The movie ends with his family returning from Paris and KEvin sees his neighbor Marley reuniting with his son  and family for Christmas.  

conversation:

user2: they were actually high
user1: rotten tomatoes is 62%
user1: that is pretty low, dont you think so
user2: its in middle
user1: i guess so
user1: in my opinion if its not over 75% its not too good
user1: but i liked the movie
user1: i think it deserves a 85%
user1: i mean they made so many movies
user2: yeah critics rate things weird
user2: they did
user1: Culkin was a good actor
user1: it was a first for the type of movie
user2: not bad for a kid
user1: i dont think they had other types of movies like that before
user1: yea i agree
user2: i dont think so either
user2: he is weird now
user1: yea i think he had drug problems
user2: yup
user2: they all do 
user1: he isnt in any recent movies right
user2: nope
user2: he is far gone
user1: yeah i guess people kind of dont like him anymore
user1: i see
user2: bye
user1: I guess he was better as a kid
user1: ok talk to you later

conversation:
user1: Hey how are you doing?
user2: Great, you?
user1: Real good just watched a movie.
user2: Oh really? What movie?
user1: Home Alone, ever see it?
user2: No I haven't, could you tell me about it?
user1: It's one of my favorite movies, the plot is basically a kid tricking adults in to traps while home alone.
user2: That sounds like a fun movie, who is in it?
user1: Macaulay Culkin plays kevin.
user1: Joe Pesci, Daniel stern, john heard and robert blossoms
user1: Like any of them?
user2: Oh yeah I've always been a fan of Joe Pesci, when was this movie made?
user1: Long ago, 1990. The critics didn't love it though surprisingly.
user2: Critics are wrong half the time.
user1: For sure, don't understand how it could get a 5.5/10, hilarious movie.
user1: His parents end up going to paris while he's home alone so kevin has to fend for himself.
user2: how does that happen?
user1: The power goes out in his house and they just forget him on their way to paris, pretty funny. 
user2: That sounds pretty funny, who directed it?
user1: Chris Columbus.
user1: You like his movies?
user2: Oh yes, Ms. Doubtfire is one of my favorites
user1: One of my absolute favorites too, he has a way to capture the mood perfectly.
user1: One of my fav parts of home alone is when the family realizes kevin is home alone mid-flight, they try to get back home but really struggle because of snow storms.
user2: Oh wow what a crazy situation, was this set in the 90's?
user1: Yeah it was I believe if I'm remembering correctly
user2: The fashion must have been great. Did the movie age well?
user1: I think it did, seems to be one of those classic movies that everyone talks about these days.
user1: It isn't until christmas that his parents get back and kevin is a bit upset about that.
user2: Oh so it's during Christmas? Would you say it's a Christmas movie or is it good for any season?
user1: Good for any season in my opinion
user2: It sounds like a great movie, I should check it out.
user1: I definitely think you should too it's pretty hilarious.
user2: Were there any sequels made? or is it just this one movie

conversation:
user1: Good Afternoon
user2: Hi... how's it going today?
user1: Good. Have you ever seen Home Alone?
user2: I have, I thought it was cute. You?
user1: It was great. It's an instant classic. 
user1: You have to watch it every Christmas at least once
user2: I agree! A Christmas must!
user1: I'm shocked that Rotten Tomatoes is as slow as 62%
user1: I don't think I have ever heard someone say anything bad about the movie
user2: I was just going to say the same thing
user1: The movie has something for everybody. 
user2: I don't think my kids at 8 could have pulled it off but thought it was a cute movie
user1: No Doubt about that. But it' still family filled. Macaulay Culkin was excellent in it
user2: I always wondered what the dad did for work to afford to take the extended family to paris.
user1: Yes! 
user1: Plus that house. 
user2: Right?
user1: I guess that is why you could forget a kid 
user2: Buzz was the perfect older brother! always picking on the younger brother.
user1: Yes. They all picked on him
user1: The mom and dad are tough but fair
user1: Plus when the mom realizes she left her baby she does the right thing
user2: You'd have thought though they could let someone know before they landed, but then I guess there'd be no movie.
user2: Could you imagine having to travel with a polka band?
user1: Exactly
user1: John Candy cameo is great in that
user1: I guess if someone is going to cheer you up it's the band and him
user2: part of me thinks it would lighten the mood a bit then as a parent I'd be annoyed cuz I just want to get home
user1: Yep
user1: Still the movie is great with Kevin and how he handles the bad guys
user1: Could a kid truly pull that off? No but it's all in good fun
user2: All the crazy traps he sets... wow!
user1: Yep. For an 8 year old he is very resourceful
user1: Gets the grocieries.
user1: ETC
user2: I am sure there is a kid out there somewhere who could come up with some crazy traps but getting them to actually work is another thing.
user1: Yep but he succeeds
user2: I could not imagine my kids at that age doing half the stuff he did.

conversation:
user2: hello
user2: have you seen Home Alone?
user2: It's the first one, released in 1990
user2: hello, are you there?
user1: Yes, I'm here
user1: I've seen the movie before and I love it !
user1: What about you?
user2: I loved it too, brings back childhood memories
user2: would you watch it again?
user1: Most definitely. It's a classic 
user2: They still show it often during the holidays
user2: I like the Christmas spirit in that movie
user1: Didn't they come out with like 3 of them? 
user2: Yes, but the 3rd had different cast
user1: and yes, very popular around the holidays. 
user2: part two was with Macaulay Culkin
user1: I don't think i've ever seen the 3rd one
user2: The fun part was how Kevin the kid tricks the thieves
user1: haha oh yea, especially when he was pretending to shoot at them. 
user2: the various ideas he comes up with to trick them and protect his house
user2: A bit too far fetched but yet funny
user2: How we was able to survive without adults and also manage to go to the supermarket
user2: not possible in real life but fun to watch on screen
user1: Right! Such a clever little boy. I think any kid left alone would freak out
user2: the touching part was when he goes to the church and meets that old man who reunites with his estranged son
user1: How shocked his mom was when she realized they left him home. 
user2: I know, she freaks out
user2: and then tries to catch any available flight back
user1: She knew something was wrong but couldn't put her finger on it. Like a mother's intuition. 
user2: That's true though, mothers always know
user1: They sure do. 
user2: And the trouble she takes to get home
user2: I think I may just watch this movie again on DVD
user1: Oh yea she has to go through a lot. 
user1: Same, I wish it was on Netflix
user2: they finally reach home on Christmas day
user2: it might be available on netflix
user2: it is even aired on regular T
user2: TV channels
user1: It's funny when he wishes his family would disappear and they actually do
user2: sometimes I come across some old movies while surfing channels

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: What do you think of Macaulay Culkin as Kevin?
user2: hey how are you
user2: i loved home alone movie
user2: his character was very funny
user1: Doing good.  I loved it too.  It is one of our families favorite Christmas movies.
user2: yea its a classic, never will get old
user1: Its funny, now that they are teens, they ask these serious questions, like how could parents forget a kid at home.
user2: yea
user2: they were so busy they forgot about kevin
user1: Try explaining that to a 17 going on 27 year old.
user2: lol
user2: tthe movie still makes me laugh to this day
user1: I think my favorite parts were the booby-traps.  I could see my boys doing something like that!
user2: lol yea he was a ver smart kid setting those traps
user2: very*
user2: i think almost all kids can think of a clever trap
user1: Resourceful for sure.   
user1: I think his ideas just get better and better as the movie progresses.  
user2: yea he went with the flow
user2: what are some of your other favorite parts
user1: Robert Blossom plays Marley.  Wasn't he the old man who lived across the street?
user2: yea they thought he was crazy
user1: I saw him as a sweet old man, especially at the end of the movie.
user2: yea he saved his life
user2: his bigger brother gus was a problem for him lol
user1: You asked about my other favorite parts, what did you think of Kevin's grocery shopping?  
user2: i think he was a very smart kid
user2: he knew what to buy
user1: I'm surprised that Rotten Tomatoes only gave it 5.5 out of 10.
user2: i never seen them give a 10 ever
user1: True.  Hard critics.  lol
user2: yea
user2: i like both of the home alone movies
user2: i also liked th ending
user2: the
user2: it had a great meaning to it
user1: I had forgotten that the burglars signature move was flooding the houses they break into. 
user2: kevin realized what family was about
user1: Yes.  A great lesson to all of us!

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you today?
user1: Im doing fine.
user2: Have you seen Home Alone?
user1: Yes I have. 
user1: Did you ever saw it?
user2: Bring back many happy childhood memories-grew up watching it, over and over again!
user2: especially around Christmas!
user2: Macaulay Culkin was still a normal kid back then
user1: Really? I saw the film as a kid too. I actually had a little crush on Macaulay Caulkin!
user2: Yes:-), he was still normal back then!
user1: Yes he were. Unfortunately Hollywood did him in.
user2: such an innocent movie that reminds me of the good old 80's decade
user2: such a peaceful time!
user2: It was a very cute and sweet film, they don't make them like that anymore
user1: It sure were@ I loved Joe Pesci's character. it was funny. So was Daniel Stern
user2: yes, totally!
user1: Yeah the film was such a classic and I think the entire cast was great. 
user2: They made modern version of the movie-not the same at all! Today everything has to be " boom doom and gloom!"
user2: zombies and apocalypse!
user2: Yes, all the actors were phenomenal !
user1: I were about to mention that. Yes its true about today's film. Too much end of the world type movies makes you feel will  become a zombie yourself lol
user2: I know, that's why I always re-watch the oldies-like this one!
user2: Even my kids liked Home Alone, although they think it is ancient!:=)
user1: Hey, it might be ancient but like I said earlier, it's a classic just like Miracle on 34th street. It never gets old.
user2: Very true!
user1: What's your favorite part of the movie?
user2: I love when he fights the two villains, but the best and most touching part is when he gets reunited with his parents! 
user1: Yes! and his cousin butch. He was such a bully to him. I like it when Kevin saw a picture of his girlfriend and said yuck! lol
user2: Yes, Butch was funny!
user2: and the two nerdy cousins with glasses:-)
user1: He is a very smart boy and knew how to set up booby traps for those villains too
user2: yes, very imaginative!
user2: And the old man that was shoveling the snow that he was initially afraid of!
user2: Very touching story there!
user1: I wondered why the entire family did not head back home. Only the mom did. I dont think i could be comfortable on the other side of the world with my young  family member at home by himself;
user1: I forgot about the old man. He did came across as creepy but was definitely sincere and helped him out at the end.
user1: oh and John candy was in in too
user2: That's true-but I guess mother was the first person who would want to be with him!
user2: John Candy was an awesome comedian, rest his soul! so many good films!
user1: It worked out at the end so that what matters
user2: Yes!
user2: Have a great day and thanks for the chat!
user1: I am glad to have this conversation with you
user1: Thanks and you're welcome

conversation:
user2: !ereht iH
user1: Hello, have you ever watched the movie Home Alone directed by Chris Columbus? It has an A rating on CinemaSCore!
user2: Omg that was backwards lol. I have not read that.
user2: I mean watched that lol
user1: You should watch it! I really enjoy Macaulay Culkin's role as Kevin in the movie.
user2: So have you watch the Pirates of The Carribean?
user2: I couldn't even spell his name lol
user2: What does he doe?
user1: I have not watched Pirates of the Caribbean, but I can tell you that in Home Alone, Kevin is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation.
user2: How do you mistakenly leave him behind. Just call his cell phone
user1: He enjoys being home alone, but unfortunately he has to contend with two burglars played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.
user1: Haha! I don't think cell phones existed quite the same way in 1990, when Home Alone was released.
user2: Oh
user2: Well, why didn't they just take him? Seems more like neglect
user2: Parents should go to jail and he be put in a foster home.
user1: There was a lot of confusion going on as there was a power outage during the night. The whole family was rushing to get everything together and in the confusion managed to leave the poor kid behind.
user2: Seems like his parents don't care about him that much.
user1: I agree, it was very irresponsible of the parents. But at the same time, Kevin did enjoy being home alone!
user2: How old was Kevin?
user1: Kevin was only 8 years old in the movie. Definitely too young to be left alone!
user1: The parents did notice that Kevin was missing as soon as they arrived in Paris at least.
user2: Yea, well eight year olds also think that smoking is enjoyable
user2: Can't trust their feelings
user1: Well either way, once you look past the implausible plot, I'm sure you'll enjoy the slapstick humor the movie offers.
user2: I don't think I want my kids watching that movie.
user2: Have you seen Batman?
user1: It may be a little violent for kids, I agree. In the film, Kevin sets up a lot of elaborate booby-traps in dealing with the burglars.
user1: Yes, I have.
user2: What doesn't he just call the police?
user1: Actually, Kevin does call the police, and they eventually end up arresting the burglars Harry and Marv.
user2: Wait. what?
user1: Yeah, I guess it just took them awhile. It's pretty ridiculous!
user2: It's okay
user1: The police don't even arrive until a man named Marley knocks the burglars out with a shovel. Crazy!
user2: I think I like watching movies that I consider fantasy to be more fun for me
user2: The police are slow, that's unfortunate
user2: But if I am driving with tinted windows, boy are they ready!
user2: Hi I think we have been chatting for a while. I have to go now though. It was fun talking to you!
user1: Indeed they are! Ha! At least everything turns out okay for Kevin in the end, as he's reunited with his family after they manage to get a direct flight back to Chicago where they live.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hi, I'm Kate
user1: home alone is a fantastic comedy film
user1: how do you feel 
user2: Okay, but I'm getting a cold.
user2: I'm surprised to see that the first half of the film is said to be flat and unsurprising.  Too bad.
user1: macaulay culkin  have good sense of humor
user1: but the second half is praised for its slapstick humor
user2: I agree.  I had forgotten that Catherine O'Hara plays his mother.
user1: oh! WHAT ABOUT ELABORATE BOOBY-TRAPS
user2: Hard to imagine that someone could accidentally leave their child at home but I guess that's what movies are made for.
user2: Hmm, Huges pulling our strings, wonder what that means
user1: likely budget of ten thousands of dollar
user2: Yeah, it does mention that.
user1: yep
user1: and criticized the plot
user2: Who?
user1: do you know about sadistic festival
user2: I think they mean there's quite a few cases in the movie where Macaulay gets the better of the burgalars
user1: do you have incident like this to went paris for christmas vacation
user2: no
user1: ya i agree with you
user1: oh no 
user2: Seems like the movie got so-so ratings
user1: good comedy movie i think
user2: Well now I understand how they forgot him at home.  They were rushed to get to the airport.
user2: Once they realized they had forgotten him, they made every effort for the mother to get home.
user1: you see kevin returns home with numerous booby traps that was a excellent scenario i think as well as suffer various injurious too
user2: Yea, they got what they deserved.
user1: kevin missed the paris flight 
user1: it is too hard to accept that he is being ridiculed by his siblings and cousin
user2: Yeah, I agree

conversation:
user1: Hi! What is the name of the movie?
user2: Hello, the title of the movie is Home Alone.
user1: Can you tell me what genre it is? (action, comedy, drama, etc)?
user2: It is undoubtedly a comedy. 
user2: Have you heard of it?
user1: No, I haven't. Can you tell me a little more about it?
user2: It is a film from the early 90s that stars Maculley Cullken as a boy left home alone on Christmas Eve.
user2: He must face robbers in a strategic yet hilarious way that involves numerous memorable scenes 
user2: Does it sound like a film you'd be interested in viewing? 

conversation:
user1: Hi, what movie did you get to discuss?
user2: Home Alone surprisingly enough, one of my favorite movies as a child. Did you find it entertaining?
user1: Yes! I loved Home Alone - so funny!
user2: Haha - do you think you would have been able to construct any of those "traps" at that age? I mean to me it just seems a bit far-fetched at that age
user1: What did you like about it?
user1: Like a lot movies the adults are portrayed as stupid and kids as genius'
user2: Well, around that age we tend to "know it all". Do you think any of the characters should have been played by someone more "fitting"?
user1: Good question ... Macauly Culkin (sp?) was perfect
user2: I couldn't think of getting rid of Daniel Stern but Joe Pesci was far from my favorite choice for that one
user2: How would you feel if they ended up doing a remake of those movies?
user1: I thought they did a Home Alone 2 didnt they?
user2: I want to say they did (?), how do you think you would have felt if you were in Kevin's position and you just got outright left by your family for vacation? Not only that why didn't they just come back for their 8 year old?  
user1: Agree - that was harsh, I would have been angry but he seemed to be glad for a while - eating whatever he wanted.
user2: As a kid, yea, all that junk food would have been amazing. Did you happen to have any brothers like Buzz in the movie?
user1: No, thankfully not - Buzz was absolutely annoying.
user2: That is so absolutely true, I remember being able to relate to Kevin because of that (my brother was a nightmare to live with). Did you end up finding in humorous when he wished for his family to disappear and his mind they did?
user1: Yes, it was like magic ... sometimes what we really hope for does come true.
user2: Have you ever had any issues trying to get back home on flights like Kate did in the movie as she was trying to get back home to Chicago?
user1: Yes, I once was delayed 72 hours in chicago ohare because of a snowstorm ... it was horrible.
user2: Oh no O'Hare is the worst place to be stranded, ended up getting stranded there for roughly the same amount of time back in 2003 lol. Would you ever end up accepting a ride with a traveling polka band to get around being stranded like that?
user1: I would never accept a ride in this day and age ... you never fully know people.
user2: Do you think it was a safer choice back in the 90's when the movie came out?
user1: Perhaps, but even then I still wouldnt

conversation:
user1: Hi! Have you seen the movie "Home Alone?" I think it's an all time classic!
user2: I saw it recently again. Macaulay Culkin did wonderful for a child.
user2: How about that bold humor?
user1: Yeah it's been a long time since I've seen it but his performance was so iconic.
user1: It was really interesting in what they put in the movie for that time period.
user2: Do you generally like slapstick type comedies?
user1: Not too much really. I tend to like more realistic movies.
user1: These sort of slapstick things make me feel bad for the person getting hurt.
user2: What's not real about some kid outsmarting two thieves lol
user2: I joke.
user1: You mean this wasn't a documentary?
user1: I guess I've misunderstood this movie all these years.
user2: If it was a documentary then I must have missed some important points. I definitely do not booby trap my house nor have I ever been robbed like that lol
user1: I haven't either but it's always good to be prepared. We all should lock our doors.
user2: Lock the doors and secure the fort. Just like our hero.
user1: Absolutely! You have to be prepared for the completely bumbling burglars in case you're 9 years old and your family leaves you when they go off on a trip to France.
user1: I always thought that sort of thing happened to everyone except me.
user1: What was your favorite trap from the movie? I loved the paint bucket scene.
user2: The paint bucket scene was probably the best part. 
user1: lol yeah it was super memorable. I remember the hot door handle scene vividly as well.
user2: Actually now that I'm thinking about it, the rigged blow torch was probably my favorite part. 
user2: I know a christmas family movie from the 90's isn't going to be scientifically accurate but some of the scenes make me cringe.
user1: Oh yeah I forgot about that.
user2: The crowbar to the ribs would have had that man knocked out completely.
user2: The poor guy would have been in the hospital with internal bleeding lol
user1: See I like scientific accuracy... Or at least higher accuracy then these crazy slapstick comedies.
user1: That's why I feel bad for them... After all those crazy tortures I'm sure they both would have been dead. Kevin probably would have been badly hurt as well.
user2: I think it's sad that the movie is based around neglect of a boy in a rich household. WHY was no one watching the kid !!!
user1: The whole way they forgot him at the beginning was just kind of hilarious. I don't care how crazy it is how do you just forget your kid?
user2: The parents are on drugs and can't remember. That was the moral of the story. Don't do drugs.
user2: Hopefully they have enough money to pay for the therapy that boy needed after having to spook off those invaders.
user2: This is one of the worst christmas movies ever..
user1: I suppose they could always sue the city or police department for not protecting them and their son better and use that to pay for his medical bills. Oh and the airline for letting them board without him.
user1: They made it home on Christmas Day. For the happy ending :)
user2: the end :)

conversation:
user2: Home Alone is a seriously awesome movie.
user1: I thought it was awesome too. I see the critics also enjoyed it.
user2: I think they're somewhat split between enjoying it and thinking it's a bit too shallow
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave a very poor rating. I can't believe that.
user2: I still think this is Joe Pesci's best role.
user1: Yes it is. I really don't like him in anything else. I wonder if the Director's real name is actually Chris Columbus. 
user2: I suppose anything is possible. I can't believe it came out in 1990. It still sorta feels like it wasn't that long ago.
user1: Right??!! Makes me feel old. Macaulay Culkin is looking pretty rough now, he was so cute in this movie.
user2: I agree. I think he had it rough for awhile after, but from what I've read and seen, he's doing much better lately.
user1: I don't see how any parents can forget their kids at home when they are going on vacation. That seems a little far fetched.
user2: I agree, but I think it becomes slightly more believable when there's such a big group of them and you're freaking out about catching flights.
user1: They overslept because the power went out and their alarm clocks reset. That would not have happened if they had cell phones. 
user2: Oh, nowadays it's almost impossible to get left behind like that. 
user1: Poor kid getting made fun of by his family and then they leave him.
user2: To be fair, he was being a bit obnoxious as well.
user1: What 8 year old isn't? The whole family flying to Paris. I wonder how much the tickets cost!
user2: That was one of my biggest questions: what job did the dad have that he can afford to pay for TWO families to fly to Paris for Christmas? Not to mention how enormous their house is.
user1: The mom rides home with the Polka band. I don't think that's safe. But I guess it was the 90s. 
user2: That's true! I forgot about that
user1: Also, Chicago is like the most unsafe place for that poor kid to be alone.
user2: It seriously is! Was it less dangerous in the 90s?
user1: Maybe a little but I'd say still not safe for a kid. But I guess no one can compete with an 8 year old and some booby traps lol
user2: Apparently they called it a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing"
user1: How clever and insightful
user2: I agree. It's a primal thing to enjoy seeing "bad guys" get beaten up in clever ways
user1: Harry and Marv sure get shown who is boss of the house. It's nice they get brought to justice.
user2: Agreed. It's a remarkably satisfying movie
user1: Its also nice that the neighbor reunites with his son and family. A great holiday movie.
user2: I think it was his daughter, but yeah. very feel good movie
user1: It says in this key scenes it was his son, but i honestly don't remember. that part of the movie wasn't the highlight for me
user2: True
user1: Its surprising that his family made it back for Christmas day. Not really that realistic, but what movies are?
user2: It needed to be that way so that the movie ended on the best note possible I suppose
user1: Do you like comedy movies that best or another genre?
user2: Drama or Psychological Horror are probably my favorites, but I really do love comedy
user1: That was the last paragraph I think.....Are we done??
user2: I think so!

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you?
user1: im ok thanks 
user1: what about u
user2: I good thank you! Any movie recommendations 
user1: yes 
user1: if u like comedies u might like to watch this one again
user1: becasue i bet u watched thsi already
user1: home alone
user1: have u watched it ?
user2: Oh Definitely! Is a Christmas Classic for me!
user2: *Its
user2: Do you like the film?

conversation:
user1: Good Morning, The movie we will be discussing today is Home Alone. Have you seen it?
user2: Yeah.
user2: I thought the movie was bad
user1: I was born in 1989 its amazing the movie is coming up on 30 years old already
user1: Really? You might be the only person I have ever met that didnt like the movie
user2: There were good parts, but it's too farfetched
user1: They might have overdid it with all the sequels but as a kid I thought the movie was amazing
user2: I thought it was lame as kid too.
user1: The concept wouldnt work in today's era though. With smart phones and smart houses this would never work
user2: nope
user1: Lol, I always wondered what would happen if I was left alone like Kevin as a kid
user1: It was great seeing Joe Pesci in it
user1: That movie kinda prepared him for the 90s. After that he did Goodfellas and of course Casino. \
user2: Why didn't he just kill kevin
user2: it'd fit his profile
user1: Lol i think cause Kevin was a kid and they wanted to have a good ending
user2: the worst ending was them making a sequal that was even worse
user2: then an EVEN WORSE sequal then that
user1: I admit the sequel was awful. Him being Lost In New York when he was originally from Chicago is dumb
user1: and what Kind of family would be stupid enough to lose their kid twice
user2: lol yeah
user2: or even once considering
user1: Rotten Tomatoes has it rated at a 62% I guess you werent alone thinking the movie sucked 
user2: It was way to coincidental for him to be left behind
user2: look at all that had to happen
user2: power had to go out, NO ONE had to notice him missing, other kid had to be there to be conted
user1: I thought it was funny him using his parents credit card, going grocery shopping and ordering pizza. Him playing the tv loud acting like it was a parent at home
user1: During Christmas too that would have to be nerve wrecking for a parent 
user2: well, yeah
user2: another thing is the security in the airport 
user2: you think they would have let that happen
user2: lol
user1: Yea I guess as you get older you start to realize how silly the stuff you liked as a kid really is
user1: I watched Ace Ventura for the first time in like a decade, and felt stupid for ever liking the movie lol
user2: Nah, just that movie
user2: I didn't like ace ventura either!
user2: ugh
user2: I was born the same time as you 1987
user1: Chris Columbus is listed as the director. Lol how ironic
user2: guess you were just more fun

conversation:
user2: lets talk about home alone a 1990 film written and produced by john hughes
user1: Oh, I am interested in seeing that movie.  Can you tell me what it is about?
user2: it is about a boy who is mistakenly left behind when his family goes on vaccation to paris for chrismas
user1: Who is the main star of this movie?
user2: Macaulay culkin is the star he plays the character of kevin
user1: Thanks for that info.  Can you tell me, how long is this movie?
user2: you know i don't know that you may find that info on the web but did yo know it gets a cinemascore of a?
user1: No, I did not know that.  Thank you for that information. Is this movie a comedy or a drama?
user2: it is a comedy in witch the boy left behind named kevin creates elaborate booby-traps compared to the rube goldberg machines 
user1: That sounds really funny. Can you tell me more about the villian or villians?
user2: the villans are played by joe pesci as harry and daniel stem as marv the movie starts with kevin being left behind due to a power outage caused by einds the morning they left for vaccation
user1: Oh, Joe Pesci.  I love that guy. He plays some amazing characters.  Do you happen to know what time of year the movie was released?
user1: If that information isn't there, please don't worry about it, I'm just asking questions as directed...trying to keep this going.
user2: I do not but the movie is highly praised for the conversation between kevin and marley as well as the final scens of the movie
user1: Can you tell me are there any scenes that would frighten a young kid?
user2: well i would have to say the scene when kevin gets left behind that morning could slightly scare a young child as i remember as a child being scared to be left alone but i could also see some children finding it exciting 
user1: I have a very sensitive child.  I think he might be disturbed that this happened.  Tell me, how did the parents manage to forget him?
user2: i think the scene where kate discovers kevin is missing might frighten parents more than any scene would frighten children
user1: Ha, you know, I remember that image from years ago.  What is the name of that actress?  Catherine...something, right?
user2: you know i am not really sure but i am sure it could be found online her characters name is kate and she does everything she can to get back to kevin but only makes it as far as scranton pennsylvania
user1: I think it's Catherine O'Hara.  But no matter.  When was the last time you watched this yourself?
user2: had to have been when i was a small child i remember the scene when she gets in a van with a polka band that was on there way to milwaukee 
user2: and the scenen where kevin returns home and booby traps the house and all the fun begin with harry and marv
user1: Hmmmm....that reminds me of another movie that I loved.  But I guess we are supposed to discuss only this movie.  Did you know that the actor John Heard, who is the Dad in this movie, recently died?
user2: no i had not heard that thats to bad he was a good acter. in the movie on chrismas day kevin was disappointed his family had not returned i would have felt the same way as a child 
user1: I spent one Christmas entirely alone and I do not recommend it for anyone.  it's very hard.  It would crush a child, I am sure.
user2: didn't seem to affect kevin in the way it would have most children he set up many booby traps that were just ingenious like when the snow shovel hits marley and knocks him out 
user1: I actually don't really enjoy comic violence like that.  Is there a lot of that stuff?
user2: the funniest scene to me is when buzz yells out kevin what did you do to my room
user2: there is the whole movie is based on kevin booby traping the house and hurting the intruders

conversation:
user1: do you agree that the first half of the film was flat and unsurprising?
user2: Its been a while since i saw this movie, not every memorable.... the first half was just as flat as the second lol
user2: Do you remember the movie?
user1: yeah i dont think anything pops out as surprisingly other than cringing at scene when harry and marv came across the traps
user1: a bit, I think watching it as a kid I thought it was far more realistic than it is.
user2: ya,  the fell for all the traps.  Crazy premise.  I really dont understand the popularity
user2: How could you forget an entire kid at home lol
user2: Dont they also have sequels? 
user1: And luckily have that child smart enough to fight burglars
user1: I believe so. They really keep forgetting that kid
user2: and he keeps fighting off burglars
user2: might have been Culkins career best....
user1: I dont think I;ve seen him in anything but home alone
user1: It's also a bit odd that its such a christmas classic
user1: it's not exactly cheerful
user2: ya... and it is.  I might play it for the fam next christmas.  its kind of funny
user2: slapstick humor i guess
user1: yeah i guess i agree with the ratings it got. It's not like its a masterpiece but for kids I can see the humor
user2: ya, the ratings definatly make sense
user2: cult classic i guess
user1: I cant remember if they even try to get anyone to go and check on the kid
user1: like a neighbor or friend
user2: i dont think they did.  did they spend the entire movie trying to get out of the airport?
user1: yeah until mom gets to PA and hitchs a ride with the polka band
user1: Which has a member of one actor that I cant remember but i think died
user2: I cant even remember.  i can only remember some of the booby traps... .like them slipping on marbles or something like that
user1: yeah i remember them catching him at some point and saying how they were gonna kill him
user1: A bit extreme for adults with a child
user2: Wow.... the family got all the way to Paris before realizing they left him?
user1: yeah literally on the plane
user1: how would they not notice an extra ticket or him not at check in
user2: Horrible parenting lol
user2: especially how hardheaded he was lol
user2: is 62 a bad Rotten Tomatoes score?
user1: yeah the sequel would be the visits from child services
user1: I never know
user1: I can never remember if lower scores are better or higher are
user2: looks like we are done... had to stretch this convo.  Home Alone is a toughy!!!

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello
user2: Ever seen the movie Home Alone?
user2: I've seen it a long time ago and thought it was pretty good, but the ratings for the movie are just average/mediocre.
user2: Hello?
user1: Home alone is a classic, though I have trouble siding with Kevin McCallister following his demand for cheese-only pizza.
user1: Do you think that in real life a tag team duo such as the wet bandits could sustain a life of crime considering their faces and fingerprints are all over every crime scene they leave behind?
user2: lol, i don't know.
user2: Joe Pesci is so goofy in the movie
user2: What do you think of Macaulay Culkin's performance?
user2: I think he was only like 10 at the time
user2: maybe even younger
user1: Pretty stellar considering his age, definitely very young.
user2: How would you rate the movie?...Overall it got an average rating of 5/10
user1: I'm gonna give it a solid 8/10. There's nothing not to like.
user2: Yeah, I guess I would rate it like a 7, although if I watch it now, I'd probably lean more towards the average.
user2: Watching it as a kid is different than watching it as an adult
user1: It definitely deserves a re-watching. This movie really holds up.
user2: Yeah, but I don't feel that the plot is something that can happen in real life.
user1: Absolutely not, Kevin almost certainly would have been killed.
user2: Kevin gets sent upstairs and is forgotten about the next day.
user1: yeah, terrible parenting all around
user2: yeah, and the mom only realizes it when she's on the plane.
user2: unfortunately for her though, all flights back home are booked after she arrives in Paris for their vacation.
user1: Thankfully her son was raised by old tv shows and learned how to make traps with a high slapstick factor.
user2: the mom ends up traveling with a polka band back to Chicago...
user2: hmm, I don't quite remember that scene
user1: She sure does. The movie never addresses how Kevin's brother had so many illegal fireworks.
user2: What part was that?
user2: I don't remember the fireworks part much either...
user1: When he creates the firework trap.
user2: this movie IS like 25 years ago
user2: oh, i think as part of the traps
user1: True, and we're WAY past 4 conversation turns. 
user2: with the TV show
user1: Hey robot, how do I finish this conversation?
user2: lol, I'm not a robot
user2: A few more turns....I guess we're close to finishing
user1: Fine, AI then. What do you think of the chippewa?
user2: what's chippewa?

conversation:
user2: Hi 
user1: Hello!
user2: have you watched the home alone before ?
user1: I have but it was a long time ago
user1: I don't remember the details
user1: Is it good?
user2: i cant beleive its 62% on rotten tomatoes 
user1: Oh no way
user1: I thought people loved it
user2: its been always one of favorite movie of mine
user2: i guess every child must have watched this movie in childhood
user1: Totally
user2: i have watched every part of it 
user2: when he lost in new york is best part
user1: So you would rate it higher than a 62%?
user2: yes obviously 
user1: hahha
user2: among kids it should be above 80% rating
user1: I could see that
user2: that witty naughty child he take me to my childhood 
user1: What else happens in it? Doesn't he do pranks or something
user2: i was not that much naughty 
user2: but i always wanted to deal with bad guys like he did
user2: lol it sounds funny
user1: lol
user1: cute kid
user1: should i watch it again
user2: yes yes made it fast , i would suggest 
user2: start from the first part of it 
user1: Is it a christmas movie?
user2: when he was alone at his home 
user2: then the new york part of it 
user1: oh, okay
user2: yes in 2nd part he went to new york with his family on Christmas but he missed the flight and got lost in new york 
user1: Ohh gotcha
user2: where he happend to pass by 2 bad guys 
user1: oh no
user1: And they chase him?
user2: then rest of the movie revolve around that humors child play 
user2: yes they chase him 
user1: fun fun!
user2: yes double fun 
user2: children should be like kevin 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello. Are we talking about home alone?
user2: Yes we are
user1: I like that movie
user2: It's amazing I think I saw it something like 4 or 5 times 
user1: It is very funny. Macauley Culkin looks like a mess an adult but was a cute kid
user1: I have 5 kids so I have seen it hundreds of times
user1: I am also 40 so that is part of the reason. I saw it actually when it came out in the theater.
user2: Oh that's cool to hear
user1: It was $3
user2: Im 19y but when I see this movie it always reminds me of the young me
user2: Like all the things that he does in the movie are somehow related to every child
user1: It was $3 at night
user2: Cheap
user1: Yes that was 1990
user2: The director Chris Columbus also did a great job
user1: He did. 
user2: Idk about you but here in Italy they keep showing that film every christmast
user1: The acting was great
user2: Yes it was 
user2: Some scenes were sooo funny
user1: especially when he pretends he is a gangstar
user2: ye ahahah
user2: in the bathroom 
user2: singing
user1: yes. or when the bad guys get electricuted.
user2: yes that one is funny too
user2: in general the 2 bad guys are so funny when they are trying to catch him and stuff
user1: I love that. Or him in the park
user2: ye meanwhile his parents are so stressed
user1: yes. I can understand
user2: I believe the mom booked a flight to go back but the flight got blocked or something like that
user1: I would have noticed in 2 seconds
user1: that would never happen
user2: Yea that's sooo hard to happen
user2: almost impossibile as you said
user1: Yes
user1: I would never lose a kid
user2: Overall that's surely a great movie
user2: that will remain in history
user1: It is epic.
user2: Well it was great to talk to you
user2: I guess we can finish by pressing the "Finish conversation" thing in the bottom right corner
user2: thank you and have a great day

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you saw this movie?
user1: Yes I have, have you?
user2: Yes, it's been several years, but was cute. Did you like it?
user1: I liked a lot, it was very funny and always a good movie to watch
user1: did you like it?
user1: how many times have you seen this movie?
user1: what was your favorite part
user1: and when was the last time you watched it
user1:  Do you agree with the rating of the movie? 

conversation:
user1: Hello, How are you today?
user2: I'm good, how are you?
user1: I'm doing great. What did you think of Home Alone
user1: ?
user2: I really like the casting
user2: Great choice in actors
user2: What about you?
user1: I think it was a very underrated movie. I think the critic scores given were very low.
user1: I personally would of gave the film a 8/10.
user2: It seems the critics had a lot of negative things to say
user2: I agree
user1: Yeah, a bit too much negativity and what's worse I don't understand the logic behind the complaints
user2: I would rate the movie around a seven as well
user1: How did you like the overall story of the film?
user2: I feel like a child being left behind on a vacation seems unrealistic 
user2: However the film was really funny once you get past that 
user2: What did you think?
user1: I can agree with that. Forgetting your kid does seem a bit far fetched...well atleast for that length of time.
user1: I thought it was decent overall, a lot of learning lessons come to light at the end of the film
user1: It was a pretty wholesome film
user2: It's a feel good movie altogether, I would agee
user1: What did you think of the cast? Any standout performances?
user2: I think Kate did a great job portraying a desperate mom trying to reunite with her son.
user2: Joe Pesci was also great, an iconic performance I would say
user2: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user1: Yeah, she played the mom role fairly well, it was believable and immersive. Joe was actually over performing in my opinion and Daniel Stem was just hilarious.
user1: I'd say my favorite part of the movie was then end personally.
user1: I like that the film focused on everything the character's learned throughout the film to be better people moving forward.
user2: So it seems you valued the lessons learned over the actual proceeding events of the film
user2: What about the ending did you like best?
user1: Yeah I think the values was important, don't get me wrong the event throughout the film was hilarious.
user1: In terms of the ending, I'd say parent's learning not to neglect their kids, the kids not bullying eachother, etc.
user2: I can't believe how low the ratings were, the movie has everything you want: hilarious scenes, family bonding, and overall great screenwriting
user1: Yeah, I don't understand what exactly was so bad about the film.
user1: I wonder if they were expecting realistic scenarios or what.
user2: I agree, all important life lessons. I am sure everyone checks for their children before leaving to the airport post-Home Alone
user1: lol I would hope so
user2: It seems the critics were especially harsh towards the director 
user1: Yes, but it hasn't stopped him from making more installments of the movie which is good.
user1: Thanks for chatting with me. It was fun!
user2: Have a great rest of your day!\

conversation:
user2: Hello, what movie should we watch?
user1: Hey! Want to hear about one of my favorite Christmas movies, Home Alone?
user2: Love to, that's a great movie.
user2: Who is in that again?
user1: It stars Macaulay Culkin as the kid that's Home Alone
user1: and Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the "bad guys"
user2: ooh right.  He was hilarious in that.  Joe Pesci was awesome as usual.
user2: did you like all of Kevin's pranks?
user1: He certainly comes up with some elaborate booby traps!
user2: I agree.  My favorite is the icy stairwell.  too funny.  when did that movie come out again?
user1: wayyyyy back in 1990!
user2: no kidding!  now i feel old
user1: Me too! I sitll can't believe that they accidentally leave their youngest son behind!
user2: yeah, even though they made everyone look so busy, they really should've did more headcounts before reaching the plance.
user2: whoops, plane i mean.
user1: It's pretty funny. I guess they needed that bit for the movie to happen in the first place!
user2: it does set up the rest of the movie.  of course no one notices except the mom.
user1: haha go figure! It is still a cute and slapstick movie, though! One critic called it a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". :D
user2: HA!  guess i find adult-bashing to be hilarious.  especially when the bad guys make such funny faces, and they deserve it, robbing people at christmas time.  horrible!
user1: Right? I agree! I had forgotten that the mom DOES try to get back to him, but she ends up getting waylaid at every turn!
user1: I love when she ends up with the travelling polka band
user2: yes, it's pretty funny when she's stuck in that van with some weird band.
user1: Jinx!
user2: LOL.  polka, right!
user2: doesn't she go thru a bunch of stuff only to get home at the same time as the rest of the family?
user1: Yes! 
user1: They got a direct flight home after waiting 2 days
user2: What a funny movie that was.  We watch it every christmas.
user1: I haven't watched it in a long time. I think I'll have to again now!
user1: I love how inventive he is. I was like that as a kid too!
user1: luckily I never had to deal with that exact scenario though!
user2: Not me, I think i would've just called some friends and gone to their house till my family came home.
user1: same! Great talking to you!
user2: thanks, bye!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: Yes, many times. You?
user1: Yeah, Ive seen it a few times!
user1: Definitely a Christmas classic.
user1: Saw it in theaters with my parents when I was young.
user2: For sure. Always try to watch every year for Christmas, along with Christmas Vacation
user2: Me too.
user1: Yeah, thats another good one
user1: Do you have a favorite scene or part?
user2: For Home Alone?
user1: Yeah
user2: I always enjoy the "filthy animal" scene.
user1: hah yeah thats a good one
user2: you?
user1: I liked the scene where he was trying to make it look like people were home and had a Michael Jordan cutout moving around.
user2: Yeah, that is good one.
user1: Great cast in this one too
user1: Kind of surprised that Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 62% though
user2: Yeah, Joe Pesci and Dan Stern were great as the robbers
user1: Keep forgetting that John Candy was in it too
user2: Meh, I tend not to put a lot of stock in RT or metacritic. To each their own...
user2: Oh wow, thats right. In the airport waitng with the mom
user2: His Pola band, lol
user2: polka....auto correct ><
user1: haha
user1: Wonder what ever became of the other kids
user1: If any went on to do any big roles later in their careers
user2: I feel like i've seen the older brother in some other things...
user1: Buzz? Maybe
user2: Yeah, that was his name.
user1: He kinda looks like that guy from Super Troopers
user2: Too bad about Culkin...child actor is a tough gig
user1: Yeah, for sure.. 
user1: Alot of crazy stories about him..
user2: Nice chatting with you. Take Care!

conversation:
user1: sups
user2: HELLO
user2: There is a lot of slapstick humor in this movie. 
user2: what did you think about the movie?
user1: I think it was a funny movie when I was a kid
user1: I laughed my ass off when I was like 10 years old
user2: Me too. Macaulay Culkin was perfect in this role. 
user2: I still don't understand how you could leave a kid behind, but oh well!
user1: I think I saw another movie features this little kid a while ago, it was like his parents being forced to open a vault inside a mountain or something
user2: Hmm interesting! I don't think I've seen that one, but it can't be as popular as this movie was. 
user2: It's funny this movie didn't get great reviews, but it made a ton of money!
user1: this one's definitely deserved love from 90s, you know the feeling that when you are a kid, and you somehow simply resonate with a movie like this, same goes with harry porter
user1: I don't give two f**k about those critics review, you love a movie when you love a movie, and that's that
user2: yeah this is definitely one of those movies that takes you back. I forgot that this is supposed to happen outside of Chicago and I forgot how good the other actors were. Yeah critics do suck pretty bad!
user1: that's their job, they'd judge everything inside a movie, when it's simply joyful to lay back and enjoy a show
user2: exactly! they spend every freaking moment trying to critique the movie instead of grabbing some popcorn and a drink to enjoy it!
user2: Man I miss Joe Pesci being in movies!!!
user1: but anyway, box office don't lie, when it's selling well, it only means that people love it, who cares about critics, haha
user2: you are so right..Money always moves the needle!
user1: I think the last time I saw this movie was more than 10 years ago, damn
user2: Yeah it's been a minute for me too! As I'm reading these scenes, some of this stuff I forgot happened!
user1: yeah, before reading those details, I only remember how the kids set up the booby traps and mess with those 2 burglars 
user2: Lol! Yeah I definitely don't remember the details. I don't even remember the mom getting back to Scranton, PA. 
user2: I mean a traveling Polka Band! I don't remember that at all!
user1: umm, I think the Polka Band tingles my memory a little, maybe it's still in my subconsciousness!
user2: Dang, you are better than me! I just remember the kids facial expressions and his constant ability to thwart the bungling thieves. 
user1: do you remember the scene where Kevin went to central park or something and met with a homeless guy feeding his birds maybe
user2: Sounds slightly familiar...Some guy that was giving him advice right?
user1: sounds right
user2: Is that this Marley character that this scene is talking about?
user1: not sure if it's homealone 1 or 2, what's the odd that he got left behind twice, lol
user1: wait, it's in chicago, so not central park, could be millenial park
user2: yeah exactly! But like you said earlier, the first one made so much money, you knew they were going to do another. 
user2: You could be right about the park
user1: do you remember another family movie where a dad is dragging his family to Europe
user1: for vacation, and it's hilarious
user2: is that the national lampoon's movies?
user1: oh yes
user2: those are awesome...especially the original ones with Chevy Chase
user1: totally classic
user2: I'm surprised they haven't tried to do a remake with this movie with some new actors...
user1: back in 90s things are simpler, nowadays making a movie without offending something, or something is very difficult
user1: people are becoming overly sensitive
user2: I agree with you wholeheartedly. The PC crowd has taken over and now people are offended when you breathe....
user1: true, good for us, we have those old classic movie for a genuine laugh
user2: The sequel of this movie should have had Child Protection Services take Macaulay out of the home!...Lol! You're right about the classics!
user1: as ridiculous as it may sound, they made 3 not 2!!
user1: the third one bit of lame though, don't remember it at all
user2: wow it didn't even know they made a third! Yikes, I bet it was pretty bad!
user1: typical Hollywood strategy, keep making sequel until it starts to rot
user2: Exactly! Drain the sequels until you have squeezed out the last dollar

conversation:
user2: Hi There!  do you like the movie Home Alone?  it's the best christmas movie ever.
user1: Hi, yeah, it's a great entertaining movie.
user1: Do you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes rating?
user2: I'm really surprised it only got 5.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, I think it deserves more.
user2: Macaulay Culkin did a great job as kevin!
user1: Yes, that was a good casting decision.
user2: Which bad guy did you like more?  Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern?
user1: I liked Harry (Pesci) better. He thought he was smarter, so it was better when he would fall for the traps.
user1: Did you like the traps he set in the house?
user2: Yup, my favorite was the iron falling into Marv's face.
user2: I was surprised how many people forgot about Kevin in the attic!
user1: How believable do you think it is for parents to forget a child?
user2: seriously, right?!  
user2: i bet it happens more than you'd think.
user1: There were so many siblings and cousins in that house.
user2: yeah, you'd think they would do more than just one head count for that many kids.
user2: Buzz was such a jerk.
user1: Yeah, he played a semi-villian role in the movie.
user2: hard to believe Kevin is only 8, he survives pretty well being home alone!  His poor mom has to come home with a polka band!
user2: They do a good job showing the horrors of traveling at Christmas time, with all the over booked flights.
user1: Kevin does pretty well.
user1: Yes, they do. The hectic rushing to the airport and the flights not being available.
user2: It's so stressful to travel at Christmas. 
user1: Did you like Gus from the Polka band?
user2: I did, though I didn't find that part very believable.
user2: I was surprised when Marley show up at the end to save Kevin.  
user1: He got a good whack with that shovel.
user2: He sure did. What did you think of the ending where Marley reunites with his family.
user1: It was a good ending. He got to reunite with his son.
user2: Just like Kevin and his family after wishing they'd disappear!  sappy but still great to watch every Christmas.
user1: Marv shouldn't have flooded the other houses they broke into. It tied them to the other crimes.
user1: Stupid criminals.
user2: didn't they have a name, flooded bandits or some stupid thing.
user1: The comedy was sometimes over the top and slap-stick, but still fun.
user2: agreed
user2: i'm surpised it came out in 1990.  now I feel old.
user2: thanks for chatting!  bye bye!
user1:  You would think the Marv and Harry would have more serious injuries.
user1: Bye.

conversation:
user1: This is actually one of my favorite movies, its a shame that kevin mccalister turned to drugs and ruined his acting career.
user2: A film's success can hurt an actor's career if their last film get more attention then there last. Do you think Home Alone would be a classic if it was released today?
user1: I believe it would get the same response as it did in 1990, Do you think the film would have as much success if they replaced kevin mcclaster ? 
user2: Maybe. If it was a girl who had the same personality as Kevin. Yes.The timing is right as more female leads are coming out in films. 
user1: do you agree with the rating of this movie? 5.5/10? or do you think it should be higher or lower
user2: I think those ratings are based on current critics. It would be interest to see if they were based on critic scores from 1990. I felt the score is fine. The film was a fun adventure with little depth to it.
user1: I agree, it would be cool to see a remake to this movie.
user1: or a all grown up version of it.
user1: i even like your opinion about a female character, would be cool to see a remake with a girl instead.
user2: I think a grown up version would be interesting. Do you think a remake could be as tamed at the 1990 version? No sexual humor.
user2: Today's remakes don't have that charm that made the originals magical.
user1: you must be a old soul like me, i love older movies.
user1: haa the paragraph says adult bashing, this society is so uptight.
user1: thats why ratings are low.
user2: Yeah. But the film is about a 8 year-old boy who gets left behind because his parents forget about him. They where so focused on the holiday vacation they forgot about him.
user2: Buzz should have know Kevin was missing.
user2: I think Buzz is the true villain in this film. What do you think?
user2: Or maybe his parents internally left Kevin home alone?

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: Macaulay Culkin as Kevin is one of my favorite characters of all time!
user2: Hello, How are you today.
user1: I'm great! How are you doing?
user2: Macaulay Culkin is good in most of his movies, what kind of character did he play in this one ? i'm great thanks 
user1: He plays a child who has accidentally been left home alone while his family goes on vacation to France.
user2: oh no that sounds terrible .... how did that happen ? 
user1: He was sleeping when they hurriedly left (they over slept) and accidentally counted a neighbor boy as Kevin.
user2: OMG that is incredibly funn and terrible at the same time ... so what did he do ? how long was he home alone ? 
user1: He took full advantage in the beginning. He ate all kinds of junk food, and watched movies. When he realizes that there are a pair of bumbling neighborhood burglars trying to get into the house, he sets all kinds of booby traps for them.
user2: that sounds really funny .... what movie is it ? did his traps work ? 
user1: He watches "Angels with Filthy Souls". A fictional gangster picture. His uncle previously forbade him from watching it, so naturally he is drawn to it.
user1: He ends up being successful with is incredibly creative traps. 
user1: Critics took issue with his traps. Saying they were unrealistic and implausible.  
user2: the gangster movie sounds amusing is it important to the plot other than being the "forbidden fruit"
user1: It is certainly integral. Kevin draws inspiration from it and uses the sound clips of the gangster making threats and using his tommy gun.
user2: the critics are critical of most things in films like this ... they probably thought him being left home equated to child abuse as well ... but in things of this nature you must suspend belief and just enjoy the hilarity as it was intended.  
user2: That's funny ... What movie is it ? i'd like to see it ! ... does his family come back for him ? do the cops come and catch the burglars ? 
user1: Exactly. Rotten Tomatoes wasn't too kind either, but the movie has a CinemaScore of an A
user1: Kevin's family doesn't realize they have forgotten him until they are somewhere over the Atlantic. When the land in Paris, his mother beings a problem-filled journey back home after the police in the hometown prove to be unhelpful. Since the phone lines are down, they can't even call Kevin
user2: good grief that must have been scary for his family ... ultimately they are reunited though right ? 
user1: They were ultimately reunited! Kevin realizes that despite being annoyed by his siblings and getting in trouble with his parents sometimes, he loves his family. 
user2: awesome .. What movie is it so i can go see it ? 
user1: John Heard and Joe Pesci are absoluely perfectly cast as the "Wet Bandits" So called because they plug drains in the homes they burgle. 
user1: Home Alone is the name of the film. I highly recommend it and watch it several times every Christmas.
user2: Thanks ... I will definitely rent it ! 
user2: who else stars in it ? 
user1: You really should. It has the perfect Holiday feel and ends with a great family reuniting feeling.
user1: Roberts Blossom is also in it. He plays an elderly neighbor who has troubles with his family. When Kevin befriends him (after being scared of him) he realizes that growing up and not having your family with you is a lonely and sad thing.
user2: how does he get to know him ? i mean going from scared to friend is not an easy thing
user1: There is a neighborhood rumor that the old man killed his family, so everyone avoids him. Kevin, while running from the bandits, ends up in a church watching a choir. Marley happens to be there too, watching his granddaughter. They end up talking in the pews and teach each other a valuable lesson.
user2: oh no ... does the rumor turn out to be false ? 
user1: Thankfully it does!
user2: i'm really glad it all works out in the end.  
user2: Thanks for the movie recommendation it sounds like something i would really enjoy ! 

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi
user1: Have you seen the movie Home Alone before?
user2: Yes it was the 900s though
user2: I am new at this 
user1: We can just discuss what happened in the film.
user1: It was very popular in its time and received great reviews too.
user2: I didn't think it was right to fall through several floors and live.
user2: The part was unrael
user2: Unreal
user1: Are you talking about Marv who fell down?
user1: If so, yeah, in real life he will be injured very badly.
user2: Yes best part to me
user1: Yeah he and Joe Pesci's character were pretty funny but it was sad how they want to harm Kevin 
user2: The carpenters nightmare
user2: He was only a boy rih
user1: Yeah exactly but they did not care but I'm glad they got what they deserved at the end
user2: The booty traps would make him a awesome boy scout
user1: lol yes it did
user1: Those guys did not learn their lesson after all the pain they went through with them
user2: That's when part 2  should ah  in good point
user2: kicks
user2: In
user1: They came back for more, they were so stupid lol
user2: Bugulars movie #1 for dumbest criminal s lol
user1: yep lol
user2: Pesci is pure genuis
user1: Kevin was a smart little kid and made sure to protect himself from those guys and anyone else. At the end his family did not have to worry about a thing
user2: I would rate it in his top 5 movies list
user1: Yeah I Iiked Joe's Pesci's character and also Buzz. He was such a jerk
user1: I agree. Great comedic acting in the movie 
user2: Kevis brother was also be naughty a Christmas time which was kind of wrong to Kevin

conversation:
user2: Hello.  How are you?
user1: I'm good, you?
user2: Great
user2: Do you like comedies?
user1: Yeah I do
user1: home alone is pretty good too
user2: Yes, it is a cult classic.
user1: It says the documents are supposed to change
user2: Ok
user2: I mean that it is a staple on tv every Christmas
user1: It really is
user2: There was a sequel too
user1: there it goes
user1: what changed in the document
user1: we need to take 3 turns discussing this for it to change
user2: Ok

conversation:
user1: Have you seen the movie home alone
user2: No, is it good?
user1: it was a movie from 1990 and gave macaulay culkin his debut
user1: how have you not seen this its a huge hit
user2: Who else was in it?
user1: joe pesci was a bad guy named harry
user1: he actually got his hair burned off his head in the movie
user2: Is it the movie wth the kid who booby traps his house?
user1: it was pesci and his partner that tried to break into a house
user1: yeah thats the movie
user2: Was it highly rated?
user1: theres one line where he plays a movie scene and it says get out of here you filthy animal hahha
user2: What knds of things did reviewers say about it?
user1: sadly it is only rated 5/10 on rotten tomatoes but this was an insanely huge hit when it debuted
user1: Have you seen anything else by the director chris columus he does lots of comedies
user2: Do you like comedies?
user1: cinema score has a rating of A which is odd since the other sites say its a lower mid rated movie
user1: daniel stern is marv joe pesci's partner in this movie
user2: I dont think I have seen anything else with Chris Columus? What else did he direct?
user1: This is a christmas movie and has a lost boy subject of the movie
user2: Do you agree with the ratings the movie got?
user1: They say the film is flat but if someone believes that then they have no sense of humor and probably shouldnt be doihng movie reviews
user2: How does the boy become lost?
user1: I think them turning kevin into a protector of his home when his family accidentally leaves him home when they go on vacation is just epic
user1: have you seen any of the other movies in the series?
user2: No, I don't beleve so. Have you?
user1: kevin actually sets several booby traps to help deter the would be burglars.
user1: do you remember when he smacked marv with the bowling ball to the face
user1: he had it tied up top on a banister on the second floor and pushed them over when they came up the stairs
user2: No! lol! That sound hilarious!
user2: Do the burglars get revenge?
user1: it was thats why i think that a critic who would watch this and say that an 8yr old with a movie budget should have come up with better pranks is just an ass wouldnt you agree i mean at least its realistic
user1: they try to get revenge in the next movie when they come back the next year. these are christmas time movies also partly why they were such a hit 
user1: its a great comedy and i think it doesnt loose its interest for kids of that age 
user2: I wouldn't agree with that reviewer. An 8yr old with a movie budget would probably just spend it on ice cream. Did police get involved in any way? I cant remember?
user1: the police didnt get involved until the end 
user1: they were on their way to paris when they realized they forgot kevin
user2: Did Kevin get reunited with his family?
user1: at the end of the movie when they got back to chicago

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you seen Home Alone? 
user1: hello
user1: Yes i did.
user1: The movie was very entertaining.
user2: I thought it was better than a 5.5 rating. 
user1: Absolutely.
user1: I am surprised to these numbers.
user2: it's one of the few movies I've seen 4+ times
user1: I have seen it multiply times myself
user1: Perfect Christmas story
user2: I see one reviewer gave it an A
user1: Well deserved.
user2: yes
user1: I Did you enjoy the plot of the movie?
user1: Christmas in Paris
user2: yes. this new paragraph on the document is my favorite part of the movie
user1: Ok. How do you like Macaulay Culkin as Kevin?
user2: Very much! He was excellent
user1: Do you think he played the role to his best?
user2: Yes, definitely. did you like John Heard as Marv? 
user1: Yes, he was a good character in the movie
user2: can you believe it came out in 1990?
user1: Yes it was a long time ago, but it still rocks.
user2: The families were funny before they left for Paris.
user1: Yes. One crazy family. everybody has one. But everybody loves each other.
user2: I think so. Scene 2 in doc is funny also
user1: Yes, agree.
user2: oh i see these are key scenes, not the only scenes
user1: Yes as well.What do you think about Kevin setting up yhe place with booby traps?
user2: was great!
user1: Do you think police should have not arrest the robbers?
user2: No they deserved to be arrested
user2: this comment from critic is funny: He compared the elaborate booby-traps in the film to Rube Goldberg machines, writing"they're the kinds of traps that any 8-year-old could devise, if he had a budget of tens ofthousands of dollars and the assistance of a crew of movie special effects people" andcriticized the plot as "so
user1: Yes agree.
user2: robbers names also funnY: Harry and Marv,
user1: Yes, definitely. Funny enough to get arrested for. 
user2: ha!
user1: Do you think the ending was appropriate?
user2: yes. I think that we've each done our amt of typing so gonna sign off
user1: "Kevin what did you do to my room?"

user2: I did
user1: Did you think it was funny?
user2: it is very funny for me, an I still laugh out loud every time I watch it 
user1: Same here.
user2: I think it was so underrated in the ratings of rotten Tomatoes .
user1: I think Joe Pesci did a great job
user1: I agree. 
user2: and Macaulay Culkin was great
user1: Rotten Tomatoes should have given it a better rating
user2: right 
user1: I can't believe it was made in 1990
user1: Its almost 30 years old!
user2: wow, I was watching it as a child 
user1: Me too
user2: my childhood memories include that movie
user1: It makes me feel old! LOL
user2: lol . yea 
user2: And the director Chris Columbus did a great job
user1: Yes he did!
user1: WHat is your favorite scene
user2: Scene two, when Kate discovered that Kevin was missing 
user2: it was funny but emotional too
user2: how about you?
user1: That was a good one
user1: I like scene 3 when he rigs the house
user2: that was hilarious 
user1: And when they break into the house and get hurt
user2: I think I am going to watch it again

conversation:
user2: Good morning
user1: hi
user2: Have you ever seen the movie 'Home Alone'?
user1: Personally, this movie has one of my favorite comedians so I enjoyed it.  What did you think?
user2: Which one is one of your favorite comedians?
user1: I sort of agree with the booby-traps being out of reach for most 8 year olds but the movie still was entertaining.
user1: Joe Pesci
user1: I hear his voice and I start laughing.  It doesn't matter what he is saying. 
user2: Pesci is hilarious in every movie that he is in, even when he is not trying to be funny
user1: I know.
user2: I did get a kick out of the kid's inventiveness with the traps
user1: I could never imagine the story plot happening to anyone I know but it's entertainment which is always about reality.
user2: The plot is definitely out there, a bit, but like you said, still entertaining. I have to watch the movie every holiday season
user1: Yes, it is one of my favorites to watch during the holidays too.  I
user1: I think the CinemaScore speaks volumes to the other ratings.
user2: Do you remember the part with the gangster film?
user1: Yes, that was funny,
user2: I do not agree with any of the scores, besides CinemaScore
user1: No real mother would not miss her young child until mid flight, that part is totally unbelievable. 
user2: That is totally true
user1: And it is very unlikely that most 8 year olds would not be scared out of their minds if that happened to them.
user2: You are right again, but then there would be no movie. ;)
user1: I think it would have seemed more realistic too if the father was the one who made the trip back to collect Kevin.
user1: It just seems like a fatherly thing to do considering the distance. 
user2: Perhaps, but then it shows the mom's determination
user2: Even though up to the point of him getting left behind, the family seemed to be totally against him.
user1: I think this scene should have made Harry and Marv think twice about trying to break into anyone else's house. 
user2: What do you mean?
user1: Yeah, I think they all thought he was a bit of a brat.  
user1: That part was realistic. 
user1: Well, Harry and Marv got totally outsmarted by an 8 year old who gave them all kinds of trouble.
user2: They certainly did... The 'Wet Bandits'
user2: That name always makes me crack up
user1: I think no one would have believed what Kevin went through anyway, so there was no need to tell them his adventures. 
user2: He cleaned the pace up
user2: Almost completely...  ;)
user1: It does not seem like it's been nearly 30 years ago since the movie..time really flies.

conversation:
user2: Hi 
user2:  Have you ever seen home alone I have not 
user1: Hello
user1: Yes I have seen Home Alone. It is a great movie.
user2:  I’ve heard good things about it but looks like rotten tomato kind of gave it a little rating is 62% low on rotten tomato I don’t know 
user1: Rotten Tomatoes does not get it right all of the time. Even though the movie was made in 1990, it is still hoot and holiday staple.
user2:  Oh this is the one with McAuley Culkin.
user2:  Looks like there’s a lot of physical comedy think I remember something about there being a bunch of traps sliding down stairs in the house 
user1: Yes. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern did great as the two would be burglars.
user2:  It was kind a like the Three Stooges in that it had a lot of physical comedy
user2:  Joe Pesci I enjoy most of the work he has done so he placed the bad guy 
user1: Yes laugh out loud, slapstick comedy.
user2:  It looks like their whole family plan to spend Christmas in Paris but somehow Kevin or McAuley Culkin wasn’t able to make it and didn’t notice till after the plane 
user1: Yes the wind knocked the power out and the family rushed out of the house leaving him behind.
user2: Yeah I guess that would be super confusing you went through stressful situations so I can kind of see how that can happen if 
user1: Kevin as punished but no one blamed Buzz which was pretty unfair.
user2: Did the family have like a bunch of kids
user2:  I yeah parenting is not for the faint of heart you got to hold both  accountable 
user1: Yes there were several siblings and cousins in the house preparing to go on the trip.
user2: It looks  like his mother was the first one to notice ihe wasgone but not until the plane take off
user1: Yes. Imagine realizing your young child is left at home and you being the one to issue out the punishment in the first place.
user2:  That would be super overwhelming. But it looks like she go through a whole lot to get back .
user1: Kate relentlessly fought to squeeze in on flights that were not even close to her destination. That's a mother's love.
user1: Gus and the band were super sweet to give her a ride.
user2:  Yeah I seem like it would be such a serious movie but they mix it with a lot of comedy somehow maybe that was the slapstick part of it or the oddball aventures 
user2:  So it looks like him will be having the house and them trying to get back to him kind of had a parallel pattern in the movie or do they just focus more on the house and the robbery 
user2:  Sorry him booby trapping the house 
user1: It's parallell. The mother is concerned the whole time and Kevin is disappointed to find his family still gone. 
user1: Kevin was very smart to devise all the booby traps. He was even smart enough to not call the cops to his house and they discover he was home alone, but to a neighbor's house.
user2: It seems like A good Christmas movie that teaches the value of family probably
user2:  Kevin seems very interesting 
user1: Absolutely. The family reunites as well as Kevin's new friend Marley's Family. It's very touching until Buzz realizes Kevin is still the pesky little brother he has always been.
user2:  Well thank you for teaching me about the movie you have a wonderful day 
user1: you as well
user1: Make sure you check out the part where the father Peter  finds the missing gold tooth in the house. Gives him a clue that something strange may have occurred.

user1: Hello! Do you like the movie Home Alone? I thought it was a good family film
user2: Hi
user2: Yes i have seen that movie
user2: What stood out to you?
user1: I think the cast was great. Culkin and Pesci did a great job as Kevin and Harry!
user2: I cant believe that it is from 1990
user2: How funny is that
user1: Yes. Time flies. 
user1: Interesting the movie got mediocre reviews. 
user2: How funny it is that kevin got left behind on vacation
user1: I thought it was a good movie though
user2: It seems like the critics were not nice to the movie
user1: Agreed. I thought the plot was quite original
user2: Yes me too. It was amusing if.not.comical
user2: I guess many found it hard to.believe
user1: Christmas in Paris turned nightmare according to Scene #1
user2: I guess some critics saw it as being brutal to adults
user1: Kevin's parents were doling out punishment to him the night before their trip
user2: It is definitely playing on a kids point of view but I tbought it was entertaininf for adukt
user2: Aduk
user2: L
user2: Sorry adults
user1: Imagine you are flying on the airplane and find out your kid is missing!
user2: That is true fear
user2: A parent would have to feel totally helpless
user1: Yeah and only to find out all return flights are booked..
user2: It seems like they spent alot of money on special effects
user1: Well I don't remember the special effects but they must have been very seamless
user2: It seems like Kevin was happy to be alone at first
user1: The duo Harry and Marv are wreaking havoc in the neighborhood :p
user2: I would be scared to death if robbers were after me and I was a kid at home alone
user1: Pretty smart kid isn't he? 
user1: But he gets hep from Marley!
user2: Yes i was thinking the same thing
user2: Yes marley was the best and.most real character of them all. Definitely the hero
user1: It was nice talking to you !
user1: Have a good night!
user2: You t00

conversation:
user2: wow didn't know chris Columbus was director
user1: Home alone was a classic comedy. MaCaulay Culkin did a great job of playing Kevin
user1: I am not familiar with the director. However, he did a great job.
user2: yes very good was a great comedy, feel sorry for the buglars marv  played by Daniel stern and harry played by joe pesci
user1: Yes, the burglars had their hands full with all the elaborate traps set by Kevin in this movie.
user2: kevin very good at booby traps to be a kid 
user1: I see that the document says critics did not fully like the movie. I am surprised by that fact.
user2: yes , I figured it was a well liked movie I loved them
user1: One critic said the booby traps were not plausible for an 8 year old to make.
user1: I thought the movie did a good job of making it seem realistic for a kid left home for days alone.
user2: yes it was,
user2:  makes you think very carefully not to wish for things you really don't want to happen
user1: Yes, that is true. How did the one critic consider it adult bashing?
user2: guess how  the robbers was beat by a kid? not sure thought it was a good family funny movie
user1: I thought the script was a classic. A little boy left home alone for days while his family flies to Paris during Christmas break.
user1: Also, I thought these people must be wealthy, they could afford to fly all of those people to Paris for Christmas. ha ha ha
user2: i know right, lol 
user1: And another thing, how do you leave behind a kid. I always count everyone when we do group trips or activities.
user2: i can feel how kate felt after realizing mid flight kevin wasn't with them, i would feel so bad
user2: i would never leave my kids id leave othr items before my kids that the first thing i always make sure is took care of and is where they need to be
user1: Me too. 
user2: also how you go on trip with all the family that would be hetic to me lol to many to keep up with 
user1: Yes, it is very hectic. I have been on a family trip with 8  people and it is hard to please everyone. 
user2: i also would be to scared to travel with strangers but guess a mother will do what she has to for her kids
user1: I like the part in the movie where Kate travels with the Polka band trying to get back to Paris.
user2: yes but bet very annoying ride though lol ,wonder how kevin knew to start booby traping , was it just instint to be prepared?
user2: thought it was sweet how he finally realized that marley wasn't a bad guy was a nice person
user1: Kevin seem like a kid who played tricks on people. It probably was instinctive. Also, yes It would have been a little annoying to travel with the polka band, but a mom will do anything to get to her kids.
user1: Yes, Kevin relationship with Marley was adorable.
user2: bet kevin was scared buzz was going get him for destroying his room lol
user2: best part is when mom and kevin finally got back together.
user1: I think everyone was so happy to see Kevin that it did not matter. Yes, 

conversation:
user1: Wow that was a great movie
user1: Wow, what a great movie.
user2: It sure was.

conversation:
user2: Hi I was online with someone but computer did not show me the info I needed.
user2: Is that the director?
user1: As a kid I thought this movie was the greatest.Home Alone is a must see, have you watched it?
user1: The director of the movie was Chris Columbus lol 
user2: Yes I  have seen it.  let's see if I get the page of info I need
user1: Yea Im not sure why it isnt showing you the documents as well, since we both have seen the movie we can still easily discuss it
user2: well not all but I can try anyway
user2: that was great the first time but now too many sequels
user2: The booby traps are really inspired
user1: Way too many sequels the first two were great especially Part 2: Lost in New York. I remember having that game for Sega Genesis
user2: first came out in 1990   
user1: Yea the booby traps were genius, they should make a modern version, but with recent technology I dont think it would have the same effect. 
user2: Macaulay is perfect as the little kid 
user1: Yea he was great as Kevin and his older brothers were hilarious as well\
user2: Yes, now they would have the talking spots  Sirius etc to scare the villians  
user1: Some of the critical responses are funny. "Sadistic fesitval of Adult Bashing' lmao who writes this crap
user2: They did start off slow but the booby traps really liven the film up 
user1: Lol yea that would be funny, robbers go into a house, and the Siri spokes them out because it is a smart house. Hell even I have a app that I can monitor my security footage 
user2: It didn't get a good score with rotten tomatoes but it sure is a great film and keeps ongoing

conversation:
user1: Hello how are you?
user2: Hi! What movie did you read about?
user1: Great! Today I would like to tell you about a pretty good movie I think you ought to watch!
user2: Yeah, okay! What's the movie?
user1: The movie is Home Alone. It came out in 1990 and features Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stem and more!
user2: "And more"? Who is this "and more"?
user1: John Heard, Roberts Blossom
user2: So what's the movie about?
user1: The movie is about Macauley Culkin is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for Christmas Vacation. 
user2: That sounds really dangerous for a little kid.
user1: Well, he is 8 years old, he gets in a fight with his older brother, and gets sent to the 3rd floor of the home.
user2: Yeah, okay. And then how does his family not know that he's gone?
user1: During the night, after a storm, they lose power in the house. This causes the family to over sleep
user1: In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is left behind.
user1: At first Kevin is relishing being home alone!
user2: So what makes this movie interesting?
user1: Well thats when it gets good!
user1: 2 wannabe burglars try to break into the house
user2: Honestly, this movie sounds terrifying
user1: Oh no trust me its a comedy!
user2: OMG, that sounds even worse. There's a child in danger, and for some reason, it's not being taken seriously?
user1: Kevins mom discovers mid-flight that he isnt on the flight and all flights are booked. Long story short...I dont want to give away all the details! His mom ends up flying back but the closest she can get is to Pennsylvania (they originally flew out of Chicago)
user1: She then hitches a ride with a polka band in a moving fan. 
user1: At this point, she is trying to do everything she can to get to her son!
user2: So what was your favorite part about the movie?
user1: Well, thats where it gets good. Remember I told you about the 2 want to be burglers?
user2: Yeah, what's up with them?
user1: Well they try to break in. Kevin rigs the home with numerous booby traps. The 2 robbers break in and set off the traps. 
user1: Kevin gets out safely after calling the cops. But they catch up with him at a nearby home!
user2: That sounds kinda crazy, honestly. 
user1: You should really give it a try because it is so funny! Joe Pesci is hilarous!
user1: On christmas day, Kevins Mom returns home followed by the rest of the family.
user2: What about Daniel Stern? How's Daniel Stern in it? I always felt like that dude was critically underappreciated.
user1: Daniel Stern Plays the other robber along side Joe pesci and the 2 of them together are a riot!
user1: :)
user2: To be real, that sounds like a pretty fun movie. 
user1: It is! Are you gonna give it a try?
user2: Yeah, I'll probably check it out if it's on Netflix or something sometime. :) 
user1: Great! Have a good day!

conversation:
user1: WHAT MOVIE DID YOU WATCH?
user2: Home Alone
user1: HOW DID YOU LIKE IT?
user1: I KNOW THEY MADE A FEW OF THESE MOVIES. DID YO SEE THE FIRST ONE?
user2: Some of the traps were implausible and it was hard to care about Kevin
user2: I watched the one made in 1990.
user1: SO IS IT A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE?
user1: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONE.
user2: It is a comedy that features an 8 year old and it was full of adult-bashing so it would be a family movie.
user1: IN YOUR OPINION IS IT WORTH SEEING?
user2: If you like slapstick humor, then yes, but otherwise most of it is unsurprising and flat.
user1: IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS A REAL PREDICTABLE MOVIE.
user2: Kevin, the main character, is accidentally left behind when his family leaves for Christmas in Paris.
user1: ARE THERE A LOT OF BIG NAME ACTORS IN IT?
user2: He initially liked being alone but then he had to deal with burglars. Yes, Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Roberts Blossom make up the main cast.
user1: IS IT A LONG MOVIE?
user2: I am not sure how long the movie lasted actually.
user1: IS THERE ANY SUSPENSE AND DRAMA OR IS IT ALL COMEDY
user2: There is some suspense as Kate, the mom, discovers Kevin is missing and has to try and make it back to the United States.
user1: WOULD YOU SEE ONE OF THE SEQUELS?
user2: I was not aware there was a sequel.
user1: I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE AND I THINK IT BOMBED
user1: WAS THE MOVIE REALISTIC OR FANTASY?
user2: Well, it did only score a 5.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes and a metacritic Score of 63/100. That said, it earned an A on CinemaScore surprisingly.
user1: SO I GUESS IT WAS BASED ON DIFFERENT PEOPLES TASTES
user2: It was realistic. It is based on on booby traps that Kevin set in his house that are sprung by Harry and Marv, the burglers. For example, one burgler was knocked unconcious by a now shovel.
user1: DID IT KEEP YOUR ATTENTION OR DID YOU GET BORED?
user2: It sounds like it varies based on people's tastes.
user2: It did to a certain extent. It was full of action and then a reconciliation with his Mom when she does return for him.
user1: SO IN THE END DID HE GET IN TROUBLE FOR ALL OF HIS SHENANEGANS?
user2: The only point he got in trouble was when Buzz, his brother asked him what he did in his room.

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hello
user1: So I guess we are talking about Home Alone. 
user2: What a funny movie
user1: Yeah, it was.
user1: Macaulay Culkin was great in that movie.
user2: What was your favorite part?
user2: He was funny.
user1: I liked the part where he just realized he was left behind. 
user1: My son was young then, and I could just see him feeling like Lord of the Manor... until things started going wrong.
user1: What was yours?
user2: I liked the rest when he is home alone. All the troubles. I know in real life it would not be so funny. All the actors were perfect
user1: Yes, they were.
user1: What did you think of the critical response note that the first half was flat?
user2: I didn't think the first half was flat and unsurprising
user1: Me either!
user2: I think they made better movies back then.
user1: So who was your favorite character? I liked Kevin, of course, but the bad guys were great, too.
user1: Yeah, they definitely seemed more original then.
user2: Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci are always great.
user1: Yep!
user1: Can you imagine the mother's panic when she realizes she's missing a child?
user2: Being a mother that would have been horrifying though.
user2: That's funny...we were both thinking that
user1: Yes!
user2: One crazy family.
user1: Even being just across town would be hard enough... but on the other side of an ocean?
user2: Yeah
user2: I think I would pass out from panic
user1: Oh, I had forgotten all about Buzz until he showed up in that paragraph that popped up.
user1: I think I would, too. Pass out... or have a heart attack.
user2: Yeah I was just thinking about Buzz, the older brother
user1: Yeah, I didn't remember him. But now I do.
user1: Wonder what he'd be like as an adult?
user2: Mean older brother
user2: Bully
user1: Yeah. But Kevin has new ways of making him pay.
user2: lol, yeah
user2: I am trying to remember if the one where he went to the toy store
user2: this
user1: I liked the booby traps.
user2: Yeah..he is funny
user1: Hmmmm... not sure. But maybe?
user1: No one got to enjoy Paris on that trip, that's for sure.
user2: I forgot she got a ride back with the Polka band
user1: Lots of lost airfare money
user1: Yeah, I did, too!
user2: Leave it to Kevin
user2: Rotten Tomatoes didn't score very high
user1: No, it didn't. 
user1: Metacritic either
user2: Well, I thought it was funny.
user1: Me, too!
user2: Plus, I love any Christmas themed movies
user2: Hey, look who the director is
user1: Yeah, me, too. Love the lights and music.
user2: Yeah, Carol of the bells. Love that song
user1: Yeah, I had forgotten it was John Hughes.
user1: But I don't know the director.
user2: His name is Chris Columbus
user2: I wonder if he is the great great grandson of Christopher Columbus
user1: LOL could be.
user1: Overall, it was a really good comedy, and one that families can watch together.
user2: I don't think I have watched the sequels. I may have to watch them
user1: I might just go watch the original again.
user2: Me too.

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user1: Are you there?
user2: hello
user2: Have you seen Home Alone?
user2: If not, it is a movie to watch in your life time
user2: especially around Christmas

user1: I love that movie!
user1: I saw it when I was younger
user1: When did it come out?
user2: yeah it came on in 1990
user2: out
user2: that makes me feel old
user1: Me too!
user1: I wasn't even born then...
user1: Who directed it?
user2: I feel even older now lol
user2: Chris Columbus directed it
user2: It's essentially a John Hughes movie though
user1: Oh really?
user1: WHat was that little boys name?
user1: The actor?
user2: he wrote and produced it
user2: no
user1: oh damn that actor?
user1: what was his name?
user2: Macaulay Culkin was the main character
user2: he played Kevin
user2: smart little fella
user1: haha omgod that's familiar
user1: I remember him now
user1: he put all the traps up right?
user2: that was him 
user2: trying to get rid of the burglars
user2: because he got left, wait for it...Home Alone
user1: HAHAHA
user1: how they did forget him!?!?
user1: that's crazy!!!!
user1: HOW!
user2: everyone was so rushed since they overslept on the day they were supposed to leave
user2: then Kevin thinks he wished them away
user1: haha oh yeah he didn't want them there
user1: He's a pretty smart kid though
user1: for being able to take care of himself like that
user1: I would have been scared!
user2: Yeah I couldn't imagine doing that at that age
user2: very resourceful
user1: Oh yes, very
user1: I need to watch it again
user2: I always watch it every Christmas

conversation:

user1:  Have you seen the movie  Home alone I have not ?
user2: yes i have watched
user2: many and many times
user2: infact i have seen all of its parts 
user1: However it looked like it didn’t do amazing with rotten tomatoes is 62% low amount
user2: i dont beleive it got 62% on rotten tomatoes
user2: it should be above 80% i guess
user2: its very famous among kids
user1:  Oh that’s information I was given on the page about it 
user2: 1990's kids i meant to say
user1:  Yeah as I see it looks like it was some sort of Christmas movies in the 90 
user2: yes yes 
user1:  Oh this is the one with McAuley Culkin it 
user2: i would suggest you should watch after this chat 
user1:  He was funny as a kid 
user2: :p
user2: u will enjoy 
user1:  As I read it or read about it it seems super interesting 
user2: this witty kid kevin in this movie acted very well in all parts 
user1:  This the one that Kevin or McAuley Culkin said a bunch of traps to protect his house 
user1:  It was like three stooges slapstick Kinda 
user1: Oh I see Joe Pesci was in it he is amazing
user2: yes he is 
user2: yes did protect his house but did a lot of mess too
user2: his tricks was unbeleivable 
user2: when i was young i enjoyed his every single tricks 
user2: some of them i tried in childhood 
user1: . It also looks like a really good Christmas movie because the mom tries to get the whole family back together for Christmas back safely 
user1: Yeah I think I  want to see this
user2: it was soo sad when the poor child kevin was left behind 
user2: first i thought this part wont gonna work 
user2: but later on 
user2: when that two bad ass buddies got injuries 
user2: that made me hahhahahha
user1:  Yeah I definitely have to see this it seems really fun 
user2: the film's first half is flat and unsurprising
user1: Were  there are a bunch of these home alone movies  searching my DVR 
user2: the second half is praised for its slapstick humor
user1:  Yeah the way I read it it seems like the second half brings everything together and there’s a lot of buildup to get to that point 
user1:  Well thank you so much for the conversation I’m definitely going to look at this movie 
user2: yes 

conversation:
user1: Do you like comedies?
user2: A bit pal
user1: It is a Christmas story
user1: It is a staple on tv every Christmas
user2: but I think I like the Home alon
user2: Can you believe a parent will make that kind of error in real life 
user1: It is kind of old, asit was done in 1990, but it i still enjoyable.
user2: I agree, this is evident from the ratings as well
user2: though I thought it should have a better rating
user1: Well, the critics are old stuffy people
user2: I think Chris columbus made a big hit as the director of the movie 
user1: Yes.  There was a sequel I believe
user2: kevin gets punished for reacting to his siblings ridicule jibes towards him 
user2: but that left me asking why the older brother was not punished just like kevin
user2: O'hara and John Heard are kevin's parents in the movie, I see it as a good match you know
user1: are you still there?

conversation:
user2: Hi 
user1: hello
user2: What movie do you have
user1: Home Alone
user2: I’m not sure of ever seen that is the McAuley caulkin is one
user1: Yes he is the main character.
user2: It looks like it  didn’t have the greatest reviews it looks like rotten tomato has it 62% I think that’s a bad score 
user1: yeah it's not very high
user1: It has a strange premise
user2: Oh I see Joe Pesci was in this movie too He is is pretty funny
user2:  What’s the promise 
user1: macaulay's character is left at his house when his family leaves on christmas vacation
user1: burglars try to break in and macaulay keeps them out
user2: I see it looks like the family was going to try to go to Paris for Christmas.
user2:  Oh he uses traps to keep them out I think I remember this maybe 
user1: yeah it sounds dark but they must have played it in a comedic way
user2:  Looks like the mom is the one who noticed he was missing but after the plane was getting ready to leave 
user1: Yeah 
user2:  Looks like it’s almost told from two points of view The moms hijinks to get back in the boy surviving the burglars?
user1: Probably more about the boy
user1: This seems like a kids movie
user1: And it talks about the elaborate traps kevin creates
user2: Yea Just looking at it and said trying to travel with the polka band not sure I even know what a polka band is  but it seems pretty cool 
user2:  It looks like it was made in the 90s so lotta really funny movies in the 90s .  And now I see some of the traps he did 
user2: I might have to see this
user1: I didn't see this one, but I like other movies that would sound weird like this if you tried to describe them to someone.
user2:  I agree it’s small little synopsis of a book movie kind of 
user1: I think it was a pretty popular move at the time.
user2:  Ever just seem to have any super happy ending like most cruel Christmas movies do 
user1: There are a lot of christmas movies like that

conversation:
user2: Hi
user2: What movie did we get
user1: Hi.  We got Home Alone.
user2: Oh ok

user2: Wow got some pretty good actors in this movie
user2: So tell me something about the movie 
user1: It's ranked on Rotten Tomatoes as a 62%. 63 on Metacritic and an A on CinemaScore
user2: Yeah what’s the highest review 
user1: It was made in 1990, and is a comedy film.  John Hughes wrote and produced it, and Chris Columbus directed it.
user2: That’s pretty good not great but descent 
user2: I like comedy’s so I may like this movie 
user1: The McCallister family is getting ready to leave the country for Christmas
user2: What’s the plot of the movie 
user1: Kevin gets mad at his family after getting into a fight with his brother and cousins.  He is sent to a room on the 3rd floor as punishment.
user1: While there, he wishes for his family to disappear.
user1: During the night a windstorm causes a power outage, the family is late getting to the airport and Kevin is accidentally left behind.
user2: Wow how do you forget your kid
user2: So I’m guess this the title home alone
user1: Kate (the mom) realizes mid-flight to Paris that they left Kevin at home
user1: ha, yes.
user1: Once they get to Paris, they realizes that all flights back are booked for 2 days.
user2: So what happens while there gone
user1: Actually she gets to Scranton, PA and then gets stuck.  A man named Gus is traveling with his band and overhears her, and offers to give her a ride to Chicago.
user2: Oh ok a Good Samaritan 
user2: So what happens with the kid while there gone
user1: So, Kevin enjoys being home alone in the beginning, until he realizes two burglars are planning on robbing his house.
user2: Oh no trouble 
user1: So, he rigs his whole house with booby traps.  Harry and Marv break in and spring the booby traps, and continuously get injured.
user1: It is full of slap stick comedy.
user1: While they are chasing him, he flees his house and calls the police
user1: They catch him and are about to harm him, but Marley sneaks in and hits them over the head with a snow shovel 
user2: I bet it sounds funny a kid fighting   burglars with booby traps
user1: the police arrive
user1: On Christmas day, Kevin wakes up and now is sad that his family is still gone.  But then! he hears his mom enter the house
user1: They are then joined by the rest of the family.
user1: Kevin doesn't tell them about the burglars.  Kevin sees Marley reuniting with his family and waves to him
user1: Buzz goes to his room and yells out to Kevin asking what he did to his room, and Kevin runs away.

user1: No.  I'm always behind on movie watching.  I didn't realize it was so old.  
user2: do you usually watch movies based on the ratings?
user2: It had 62% in rotten tomatoes 
user1: I don't usually pay attention to the ratings. So I was surprised when I saw the 62% in rotten tomatoes.
user1: But sometimes popular movies don't get good reviews by critics.  
user2: yes, I guess so
user2: it was produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris columbus
user2: they did a really good job
user1: I agree that they did a good job
user1: producing the movie
user2: they did
user2: it was tense when her mother were unable to book a flight to cathc up with him
user1: yes.  any mother would be worried and tense.  he was a small kid.  Too young to fend for himself I would think.  
user2: exactly
user2: but what the van owners did to her was very generous 
user1: what exactly did the van owners do?
user1: sorry, the traveling polka band
user1: yes.  They were kind to let her travel with them.
user2: they offer to take her with them 
user2: yes the band

user2: It received a CinemaScore of: A
user2: Macaulay Culkin is the main child actor!
user1: waoh, what a great movie
user1: has hent movie, the child actor?
user2: I don't understand.
user1: I mean has he acted any recent movie?
user2: According to one critic the first half of the movie is, "flat and unsurprising."
user1: the child actore
user2: I don't know. 
user2: Another critic hails it as being a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing"
user1: He dealt with those thief alone before the police arrived 
user2: The thiefs, Harry and Marv, are knocked unconcious.
user1: do you know if the movie is from hollywood or produced in UK?
user2: An American comedy
user2: Would you see this movie?
user2: It involves booby traps
user1: oh, really cool
user1: yes, I have seen the movie
user2: Do you know what holiday this movies takes place during?
user1: it involves a lot of trap that the child actor set, because it was a comedy.
user1: no am not sure.

conversation:
user2: hey 
user1: hey, how's it going?
user2: pretty well, how about yourself?
user2: so have you seen this movie before?
user2: Home alone that is
user1: pretty good. home alone's a classic so should be easy
user1: yeah, you?
user2: yes, I have seen it many times when I was a kid, laugh a lot too
user2: I thought it was funny, what about you?
user1: the sequel is the best one though
user1: yeah its funny
user1: the scenes with the traps always made me laugh
user2: haha, I remember the sequel, there were more than one though, I like the actor in the first one the best.  Yeah, the traps were awesome, if kids are really that smart and resourceful, that is amazing
user1: i would have curled up in a ball and cried at that age lmao
user1: he's in the 2nd one too
user1: the new york one
user1: the responses are so savage
user2: yeah, the third one is when they change the actor I think. His expression was pretty clever for an actor his age,  and the traps were brutal
user1: Burglars all over the world mustve hated that film
user2: haha yeah
user2: maybe they study that for homework...
user1: lmao
user1: i hope this was true
user2: haha, one thing I do not get is how the kid have enough times to prepare all those traps in the movie while they make the burglars look so dumb and pitiful
user1: or why they were even chasing the kid if they only wanted to steal stuff
user1: just take the money and jewellery and go
user1: pride got them
user2: haha, I think the movie plot got them, since the plot make them act that way, plus it is much funnier
user1: Also, after the first time, ok its a mistake. but a second, third and fourth, its now bad parenting
user2: haha, or a sequel to movie since the first one was so successful
user2: had the first movie not so successful, I doubt there would be a second or third incident in the plot
user1: lmao true
user1: imagine if kevin had gone to paris
user1: the house would be empty when they come back
user2: haha, then the burglars in the movie would be the lucky ones but they would not exist and we would have to find some other movie to watch 
user1: i think i might watch it again to see if its aged well
user2: haha, the last time I watch this movie was three years ago, I think they were replaying it on TNT or PBS or one of the movie channel, still funny
user2: if I have a kid, this would be one of the movie I recommend he/she watch as it is so funny
user1: i agree

conversation:
user2: So we both saw Home Alone.  What did you think?
user1: I thought it was funny
user2: How did you think Macaulay Culkin did as Kevin?
user1: I think he was a wonderful actor
user2: Me too, he was really believable.  What'd you think of Harry and Marv?
user1: they were great
user2: I think it's cool how they made a movie that sounds kind of sad, about a kid being left behind for christmas vacation, into a comedy.
user2: Do you think the reviews are accurate?
user1: Yes, i loved the bobby traps
user1: I think the reviews are a little low
user2: Me too, I can't believe it only got a 5.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: What scenes did you like?
user1: OHI  loved the burglers
user2: Me too.  I felt bad for Kevin the beginning when Buzz was picking on him.
user1: Yes it was sad
user2: It was totally plausible though that they would leave someone behind because of the power outage.
user1: Joe Pesci was my favorite actor in the movie
user2: He was really good.  He did a great job with Daniel Stern too.  They had great chemistry.
user2: I liked the Polka Band parts.
user1: yes i liked it wasa traveling polka band
user2: That was cool that they gave her a ride.  Really Christmas-spirity
user1: Yes in a moving van lol
user2: Gus is a good dude
user1: I could not imagine finding out my child is missing
user2: Me neither but Kevin took good care of himself with all those booby traps.
user1: Yes Harry and marry got injuries
user1: marv
user2: Yup and then his mom came home and they made up.  I like happy endings.
user1: he didnt tell them about harry or marv
user2: His dad found the tooth though
user1: yes the gold one

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: How are you?
user1: Good yyou
user1: Good You?
user2: Great, do you happen to know about a good movie?
user1: Have you ever watched Homew Alone?
user2: No, I haven't watched it. From what year is it?
user1: It was made in 1990 with a young Macaulay Culkin. It is a classic Christmas movie
user2: I see, could you give a little summary of the movie?
user2: Short summary*
user1: Its about a child who gets accidentally left at home. The rest of the family leaves for vacation and he wakes up to an empty house. Then a pair of theives attempt to rob the house all the while the young child sets up tricks and traps in a very comical film.
user2: Sounds good! I see, so it is a comedy film. Who plays the thieves?
user2: And do you happen to know the movie ratings? For example on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Joe Pesci (Harry) and Daniel Stern (Marv) and they were perfect for the role
user1: rotten tomatoes gives it 5.5/10
user2: It is rather low that rating, what is your personal opinion of the movie?
user1: My family watches it every year 8/10 is my personal rating
user1: You think you would watch it, it is definitely a must see
user2: Ok ok, anything you include something in your personal life, it rises the value for you, in this case it has emotional value! 
user2: What is your favorite scene?
user1: When the pair of theives enter the house and attempt to chase Kevin upstairs. One of my favorite Booby traps. I wont spoil the fun but it is hillarious.
user2: It surely sounds like a good scene! Thanks for sharing it
user2: And do you think the movie has an hidden message to the audience? Perhaps a lection?
user1: In the end you dont realize how much you love your family until you experience life with out them
user2: Awesome, I always like when you can form an opinion or learn something from a film
user2: It is one of the reasons why I love cinema
user1: That is one reason why I love re-watching some of the older classics.
user2: By the way, do you know who directed the  movie?
user1: I believe it was Chris Columbus
user1: ON a side note I never really look at Rotten Tomatoes ratings
user2: I don't recall in this moment any films from him, what a bad memory do I have! 
user2: Don't you consider ratings before watching a movie?
user1: Cinemascore has a better representative of my taste.
user1: They gave it an A rating so you should check it out
user2: Oh, I see. Nice point of view. Well, Thanks for the conversation!
user1: Bye
user2: It was a pleasure, good day!

conversation:
user1: I enjoyed the movie, what did you think of it?
user2: Home Alone was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I absolutely loved it. I also feel it deserved a little more on the Rotten Tomatoes. 
user1: I agree. It was quick paced, well-acted, and allowed me to "suspend my disbelief" :)
user1: I thought Joe Pesci was especially funny, but I like him in most things.
user1: Did you like Macaulay in it?
user2: I don't feel that the first half was "flat and unsurprising." It had the witty banter among the children. It honestly made me feel like I could relate in a sense. Children being stuck in a big family and being completely ignored seems about right.
user2: Joe Pesci is absolutely hilarious.
user2: Maccaulay Culkin couldn't have been better chosen for the part of Kevin.
user1: I agree that the first half was entertaining. I rarely had the house to myself as a kid and loved the concept. 
user2: In reality though, what kid is going to "relish" in being home alone with no way to contact your parents. They would probably be scared out of their mind.
user1: Good point, although after the initial shock I think a lot of kids would settle in and do what they had to. 
user1: Normally that wouldn't necessitate bashing burglers, but that was what made the movie an adventure!
user2: All the booby traps in the movie me remind me of all the pranks my step-father used to play on us as kids.
user1: Ha! You must have had an exciting childhood!
user2: I loved it although I do wish it was a little more suspenseful.
user2: I honestly think they should do another movie with Kevin leaving his kids behind. 
user1: Oh, I think that would be fun!
user1: I do usually pay attention to movie ratings when deciding to watch one, but will sometimes ignore bad ones if the plot sounds especially interesting. Do you go by ratings?
user2: My husband does. He tells me I watch some dumb stuff. I try to, but if it looks interesting to me I will watch it.
user2: I don't see a lot of stuff in the movie as realistic though. It is funny if you want a laugh though.
user1: Yes, I'm prepared for a fair amount of non-realism in movies, although I do think that basing them in reality before flying off into the wild is a good technique.
user1: Sorry to break character here, but isn't it supposed to automatically advance to the next movie after we've completed 3 "turns"?
user2: I think so but I read 15 times also. Maybe it wants us to respond 15 times with a total of 3 different sets of pages. 
user1: Oh my. We've already spent 20 minutes just on this one. 
user1: Okay, just looked it up and it says 15 times in total, 3-5 times per movie.
user2: Yeah. I know. I read it again though. I think something might be wrong with it. 
user1: I agreee. The movie page keeps appearing to reload but its always Home Alone. Do you know how to email the requester?
user2: It just popped up for me with the new one. Did you get it yet?
user2: I can email you the new documents if you would like?
user1: ohh....maybe it's been popping up with new information about home alone....this one says "this is the end of document"
user2: That is it.
user1: No, not ready to share my email, but shall we discuss this last one?
user1: The Christmas day scene was great. Disappointment followed by elation is always a good ploy!
user2: No problem. Just thought that might work, but sense we both have it now we are good. Yes, number 2 and 3 are the new ones. Honestly, what person is going to realize their kid is missing in the middle of the flight? It is like forgetting you had a kid to begin with. lol
user2: Honestly, this day and time they would have figured out he was at home and made more of an effort to get in contact with him.
user2: The Christmas Day scene was for sure good, but I feel the actors could have shown a little more emotion. You loose your kid, a Mom is probably going to be a lot more hysterical than she was.
user1: I was able to buy into the premise because my aunt actually forgort one of her 7 kids at home when she went to the store. LOL
user1: He was fine, and it was only about 10 minutes before my aunt came back.
user1: True about the hysteria. I liked the casting of the mom, though, because the actress was believable in her distracted callousness
user2: Oh my. I remember my Mother was gone for a little while and I got off the bus and still in Kindergarten. I was totally hysterical it being the first time I was home by myself. I didn't know any different. It is funny to me now though. My little sister was in Kindergarten as well when my Mom was late getting off work. We had tons of Core of Engineer property behind our home that was part of the State Park with miles of woods. She got off the bus and left her backpack by the front door and left all the doors open. My Mom thought something terrible happened to her and she lost it. It turns out she was next door at the neighbors and they were watching her. 
user1: Oh my god, as a mom I would have lost it too! 
user1: The burglers were pretty hilarious throughout, and their bungling made it the comedy movie that it was, rathern than the creepy thriller it could have been. 
user1: The bit about flooding the houses was great
user1: and that that's what made the other houses identifiable to the cops
user2: Very true. I think my husband has rubbed off on me. Every movie we watch that we watch that has military in it, he is like that isn't realistic.It seems I am doing the same. lol
user1: Also the polka band bus was pretty inspired. The mom actually did pull out all the stops to get back.
user1: LOL. We will become harsh movie critics yet!
user2: I can relate to houses flooding. Every time we went on vacation our house flooded. I mean every single time, talk about creepy!!!
user1: That IS creepy! Bad pipes?
user1: I wonder which other movies Chris Columbus has done? I would like to check them out and see how they compare to this one.
user2: No. Weird stuff did happen even when we were home. It still gives me the creeps.

user1: Ah, I have become a believer in the paranormal. Hsunted Home Alone would be a scarier movie.
user1: Wow, great response, thanks! OH, he did the Harry Potter movies? nice!
user1: The Help was superb.
user2: I haven't seen it. I might watch it tonight.
user1: I can see the similarity of his style to Home Alone in these.
user1: It's great.

conversation:
user2: hii
user1: Hi would you like to hear about the comedy movie home alone?
user2: how are you? Yes of coutse
user1: I am great. This movie stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin  Mcallister who is a young boy that is mistakenly left home alone when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas Vacation. While Kevin initially loves being home alone he soon finds out that he must protect his house from two burglars with elaborate booby traps all over the house. This movie is great for families and is overall hilarious. 
user2: I think I've heard it before, who is the director?
user1: The director is Chris Columbus the movie also stars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the attempted burglars.
user2: what are the critics of this movie? I'm very interested to see if I can get it and see it
user1: Some of the critics say that the beginning of the movie may seem a little flat and unsuprising but the second half of the movie is well worth the wait and is praised for its "slapstick humor". While some of the bobby traps are highly unrealistic they are still hilarious to watch. 
user2: And you do you think??
user1: I think that the movie seems like it would be really funny to watch a a great choice for a family comedy. Its plot seems both easy to understand for a kid and funny enough to make people at all ages laugh. 
user2:  I understand that there is more than one movie of these, right?
user1: I am not sure bu that is definitely something you can easily find online.
user2: What else could you tell me about the movie, to see if you can convince me?
user1: The movie has a Cinema Score of an A.
user2: fine, for the whole family
user1: It is a 1990 comedy which is centered around the Christmas holiday so it is a great family movie. 
user2: then it would be ideal to see it in December ???
user1: Yes it would since that is the time in which it is set.
user2: tell me a bit about some scene ... but not with much spoiler please hehehe
user2: are you there??
user1: The movie starts off with the entire family oversleeping due to a power outage which reset all of their alarm clocks. In all of the chaos to get to the airport they forget Kevin at home an do not realize till they are on the flight to Paris. Once they arrive they try to get a flight back but realize all of them are booked for the next 2 days. While the rest of the family gets settled in Paris. Kevin's mom manages to get a flight to Scranton Pennsylvania but must ride with a polka band in a movig van to get back to Chicago.
user2: something irresponsible parents do not you think ??
user2: fast please !! jejejeje
user1: Well Kevin is misbehaving so the night before so he is sent to sleep up on the third floor as punishment. It is just a big accident since there are a lot of family members and luggage to be accounted for. I think it was easy to forget something or someone in all of the chaos of catching their flgiht in the morning.
user2: jajajajajajjaa
user1: Excuse me?
user2: It's not very educational to say, hehehe what do you think?
user1: I dont know. But I do know that this movie is definitely both funny and heartwarming espcially around the holiday season.
user2: do you recommend me to see her with my children?
user1: I think it is a great movie for all ages and something whole families can watch and have a fun time with.
user2: thank you very much my friend will see it thanks to your review and recommendation .. have a nice day
user1: I hope you do too

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: hi!
user2: How do you feel at home alone?
user2: It was made in 1990 and comedy-called home alone
user1: Always love being home alone and I also love the movie Home Alone
user2: Did you like the cast?
user1: I can't believe this movie is already 28 years old
user2: Do you think Culkin did a good job in the movie?
user1: For sure.  Being as young as he was, he did a good job.
user2: it is true that it has a long time, how fast time passes
user1: I also liked Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the wet bandits
user2: I think you got very low score on the rotten tomatoes 62% is very little
user1: I just saw that, seems pretty low for a movie that is always on TV
user2: Do you think they could have scored better?
user1: It should have scored better.  I wonder if that score is based on its initial release or if it fluctuates 
user2: Would you like a new version of the movie?
user1: A remake would be cool.  I know there is a sequel or two, but have not seen them
user1: The traps that kevin comes up with are great
user2: Do you think John Hughes is a good director?
user2: Yes right
user1: Looks like Chris Columbus was the director.  
user1: He did a good job with Home Alone.  Anything else he has done?
user2: it's true, I got confused in name
user1: Buzz is a great character in the movie although he doesnt get too much screen time
user2: Would you add something to the movie? to improve it
user2: Or would you take something away?
user1: I think it stands on its own.  People like to make it a christmas movie for some reason.
user2: I also like Christmas movies as it is, it is very entertaining
user1: I typically watch a little bit of it anytime I see it on TV
user2: I never tire of seeing her, for her time it is and still is an excellent film.
user2: It's interesting and funny how the 8 year old manages to do all the mischief but without intending to do it

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!  How are you?
user2: I'm good. Have you ever seen Home Alone?
user1: I have not!  Have you?
user2: I have. It is great
user1: It looks like a fun Christmas movie!
user2: It is
user1: I wonder what age it is appropriate for?
user2: It's for the whole family
user1: That's great news!  Do you watch it every Christmas?
user1: It was released quite a long time ago!  
user2: I try to. It played in theaters this most recent Christmas
user2: Yeah, 1990
user1: Oh, really?  I don't think it did in my city!
user1: That's awesome!
user2: Harkins played it. It is very awesome
user1: I really like Joe Pesci!
user1: Great actor!
user2: The ratings were not good
user1: I noticed that!  I wonder why???
user2: It got a 62 percent on rotten tomatoes. It's odd
user2: At least the CinemaScore was high
user1: Especially because you said it was a great movie!
user2: It's a classic, yet sometimes it takes awhile for a great movie like that to be realized
user1: I was just reading through the key scenes!  Are they real good ones??
user1: Very true statement!
user2: Yes, they are executed in a really good way. They are all very memorable and you can tell that there were some great minds behind the film
user1: Is it your favorite Holiday movie?  Thank know there are many others as well!
user2: It is one of them
user1: How was Caulkin in the movie??

conversation:
user2: Hey, have you seen this movie
user2: Home Alone
user1: yes many times
user2: its a classic for sure
user1: No doubt about it
user2: I wish they still made movies like that
user1: Same here. Reminds me of childhood days
user2: yeah it really does
user2: i miss it
user2: and this was a really good movie as well, good cast
user1: They can make a newer version of it
user2: I am not sure it would be as good though
user1: They dont have to exactly copy the concept but in similar lines
user1: Hey we can be optimistic though
user2: Yeah maybe that could be good
user2: ha that is always nice
user2: I think the sequel was pretty good too
user1: They might need a really cute little star kid 
user1: Kids actors nowadays are real smart and artistic
user2: yeah, they would have to
user2: sadly yes
user2: oh well, its still a classic at least and can be watched whenever
user1: Sequel is fine but nothing can beat classic
user2: Yeah thats usually how it goes
user2: it was solid but not as good
user1: sure Christmas will be perfect time
user2: yeah it i
user2: is^
user2: And it had a nice John Candy cameo
user1: Yes definately
user2: Ha, I am not sure what else to say honestly
user2: i think we're almost done
user1: What was your favorite part or theme
user2: the old man who he is scared of
user2: and then he comes his friend which was sweet
user2: you?
user1: the traps were good
user2: yes and funny
user1: i am sure kids will be afraid of thieves forever
user2: but that is always the coolest part is the traps and him setting them up
user1: I dont know from were they got the concept but it was cool
user1: not sure kids in this technology age will ever see such cult movies 

conversation:
user2: What is the movie’s name
user1: Hi Have you seen the classic movie Home Alone staring Macaulay Culkin?
user2: Oh yes
user2: What is it about
user1: It also stars Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Robert Marley.
user2: I don’t remember watching it
user2: Did you like it?
user1: It's set at Christmastime in the 90's with the dorky sweaters and everything.
user2: Oh wow
user2: Whats the plot set?
user1: Family is in from out of town, and they are all planning on leaving on vacation. The main character Kevin McCalister gets into trouble and is put in the attic to sleep as a time out
user2: put in the attic to sleep as a time out?
user1: In all the hurry the next morning the family leaves for their flight to Paris for the holiday, and does not realize they have left him behind until the plane is already in the air.
user2: Oh God
user2: What happened then?
user2: Did they return in time?
user1: Kevin initially likes the idea of being home alone, but soon after two burglars try to rob his home, scaring him and he begins to miss his family. 
user1: It's a pretty humorous film. Kevin sets up silly booby traps to trick the burglars, and it eventually leads to their arrest.
user2: Ohh
user2: What was your initial reaction?
user1: I think there is a bit of sadness associated with the film as well, although somewhat unintended. In the beginning the adults are bashing him and putting him down, and in the end they are praising him. Not because of the burgulars, just because of their mistake of leaving him behind. I find these severe changes sad.
user2: Ohh alright 
user2: It seems interesting enough 
user2: I think im gonna watch it tonight 
user1: Kevin's mother is played by Catherine O'Hara, always a favorite of mine. And also staring in the movie is John Candy. I'm always sad to think of him, he was so funny.
user1: You should with popcorn and pizza.
user2: Who was your favorite in the movie?
user1: When it came out I was a kid about Kevin's age and I always thought it would be fun to do the booby traps and pranks that Kevin caused.
user1: I think Buzz's girlfriend. Although not a technical part in the movie, I love the line, "Buzz your girlfriend, Woof!"
user2: The actor didn’t grow to be successful 
user1: I think as an adult I can understand the sentimental details more that I couldn't fully appreciate as a kid. I even have two little boys of my own. They are Kevin McCalister's for sure.
user2: Indeed
user1: In the end the family makes it back home, just in time for Christmas and they home is back in order. Except for Buzz's room. That's the final joke of the movie, when Buzz yells to Kevin, "What did you do to my room!"
user2: Did they lodge a complaint against the burglars?
user1: The family house is incredible. It's a beautiful brick home with three floors and shutters in Chicago.
user2: That’s really nice
user2: It must have been devastated when the family arrived 
user1: Kevin while booby traping the burglars called the police. They were arrested and the family never knew about it. That's the only disconnect for me.

conversation:
user1: hii
user1: are you there
user2: Hi there
user2: Have you seen the movie Home Alone?
user2: It's been out for a while
user2: so I guess you could say it's a classic
user1: i think i saw the movie but i not seen one part of it
user1: actually are you asking about first part or which one
user2: Its a pretty funny movie
user1: what is the story of the movie
user2: A boy gets left home over the holidays
user2: accidentally
user2: by his family
user2: lots of relatives and a big family
user2: so no one notices he's missing
user2: till they're on the plane
user2: from Chicago to Paris
user2: then while the kid is home alone
user2: some pretty incompetent thieves try to break into his house
user1: yes i can able to remember that movie
user2: so the main story line is him protecting his house and getting his act together
user1: thief try to steal the home
user1: really great movie
user2: yeah, they've been breaking into houses around the neighborhood since it's the holidays
user1: i enjoyed that movie 
user2: and they decide his is the best house
user1: because at last the hotel bill comes 
user2: lots of good comedy when he uses kid style devices to protect the house
user1: his family reaction is really great
user2: Yeah, they're all amazed when they get home
user2: that he was actually able to take care of himself
user2: I watched it recently with my kids
user2: and they loved it
user2: I'm sure we'll be watching it again next holiday season
user1: i watched alone only but good one 
user1: thank you 
user2: I think there was a Home Alone Part 2, but not sure
user1: yes
user1: really there 
user1: try to watch that also
user2: I don't think that one was as well liked 
user2: but I think it had the same actors
user1: yes same characters same boy
user1: really same 
user2: thanks for the chat
user1: and so interesting 

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: HELLO!
user1: What is the movie?
user2: Home Alone
user2: what is the movie?
user1: I would like to look into that movie
user1: What is it about?
user1: hello??
user2: Home Alone is a 1990 American comedy film, about a child who has misconceptions, his family decides to travel to Paris for a vacation. He stays home alone, and some thieves try to steal his house.
user1: They try to steal his whole house?
user2: if they try to steal their belongings, two thieves.
user1: Oh! What is it rated?
user2: It is a good movie seen in many countries, it was successful.
user2: cinema score is :a
user1: Is it very violent though? I would like to watch it with children
user2: It is not violent, it is very funny, I recommend it to you.
user1: About how long is it?
user2: one hour and 40 minutes.
user2: he makes funny tricks to outwit the assailants.
user1: Are there any famous actors in it that I might know?
user2: You probably know the main actor, it's Macaulay Culkin.
user1: I like him!
user2: Do you like comedy movies?
user1: Who is the director of the film?
user2: it was written by John Hughes
user2: and
user2: its director was Chris Columbus
user1: Would I know any other films that Hughes has written?
user2: Actually, I do not know how many he wrote.
user2: although the movie only at home, has 3 more parts.
user1: Sounds good. Did it make a lot of money at the box office?
user2: He wrote a movie about a dog called Beethoven, it's popular.
user2: I remember watching it on television.
user1: I've seen it as well, but I didn't enjoy it. Hopefully it's not too similar to Home Alson
user2: It has nothing to do, they are different genres.
user2: Only at home is very fun. and they are several movies.

conversation:
user2: Hello! Have you watched the Home Alone movie?
user1: I have!  I thought the Slapstick humor was well placed
user2: I'm surprised to see that critics felt that the first half was "flat and unsurprising"! I felt it was really well done and set up the second half perfectly.
user1: I think the adult-bashing was my favorite part!  I am also surprised the first half was considered flat.  
user2: lol :) I am really kind of surprised that the Rotten Tomatoes score isn't better. Home Alone seems almost like a classic part of American culture at this Point. :) 
user1: Oh I totally agree and I thought Macaulay Culkin was the perfect kid for the part.  He wanted to be alone so bad then that happened :)
user2: Yes, he was perfect for the part! An iconic role for him. ;) 
user2: It's funny that the plot was criticized as being implausible. Of course it's implausible. :D
user1: I agree with the CinemaScore of A.  I would give it an A easily!  It does NOT seem like that was from 1990.
user2: For sure, it's hard to believe it's been that long!!
user1: I thought the special effects was perfect.  I can not imagine it any other way!
user2: The beginning of the movie, where all the cousins are gathered and the house is in chaos, seems so typical of some holiday gatherings. 
user1: I do remember Kevin being ridiculed by his siblings and cousins and it seems like my family time.  total Chaos for us also. 
user2: And then all the confusion after everyone overslept. Perfect way to identify with people, I mean that's how it is when everyone is together eating and stuff, its exhausting! 
user1: I can totally relate.  When it finally gets quiet everyone just wants it to stay quiet.  I can not imagine trying to keep tabs on all the people and kids they were trying to account for in the movie.  Confusion is putting it mildly.
user2: :D Yes, and added to that, the storm in the night and the damaged power lines... if something bad is gonna happen, it's gonna be when the house is jam packed with people. :D 
user1: I thought the burglars were played perfectly by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.  I can not imagine any one else playing them any better.
user2: Oh my, for sure!! They played off each other perfectly. And they did a great job, it was painful to watch their misadventures!!
user1: I can not imagine being midflight and figuring out that you have left something, especailly a kid at back and not being able to do a thing about it!
user2: Yes, I was just thinking of that... how Mom-like of her to leave everything and go back for the one missing little chick. ;)
user1: And when you finally land and can figure out something you get half way then to  find out that everything is booked and you can still do nothing.  I could totally relate to that on a level.  Pure Stress.
user2: Oh man, it puts a whole new light on holiday stress. It's a good thing Gus Polinski and his traveling polka band came to the rescue!
user1: yes!  Being completely stressed and then having your saving grace being a polka band in a moving van
user2: What a noisy road trip that would be! :) 
user1: The booby traps were epic!  The injuries were exactly what you would expect a kid to make up if this actually happened.
user2: Oh man, yes... when my son watched it as a child, I was almost afraid he'd try some of that stuff.
user1: Running around the house and doing the kid stuff that the adults won't even think of was the best!  I forgot about the snow shovel to knock them out.
user2: Me too. And how satisfying when they were finally arrested!
user1: Oh thats right they flooded the houses to cover it all up!
user1: Buzz always picking on him when they get home.  back to the real world and running from them all!
user2: It's amazing that Kevin could keep quiet about all his escapades, and not let the family in on his ingenuity!!

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello.
user1: what did you think of Home alone?
user1: I loved it when I was a kid but rewatching it as a parent alot of appeal has faded.
user2: I haven't seen it since I was a kid. Back then it seemed like a hilarious movie. Today, though, I dont know how I'd respond to it.
user1: I think thats kind of what happens with most movies we loved as kids
user2: Some remain great though. Like some of the old Pixar films.
user1: The kid must have been some kind of little engineer to set up all those traps too
user2: Haha.
user1: well they did a good job of mixing in stuff for adults to laugh at too
user2: I remember watching a video where some military people examined the traps, and some were actually lethal. Like the bucket on the stairs.
user1: Yea I think the fire one would probably mess you up pretty good too
user1: And the whole idea of just forgetting one of your kids. I mean seriously
user2: Well, to be fair, it was a big family.
user1: I have 3 kids  and I don't think I could leave any of them behind
user2: I have four siblings, and we were always getting lost in walmarts and such.
user1: I can't remember how many they had but I mean seriously
user1: getting lost in wal mart and boarding a plane without them is 2 different things
user1: lol
user2: I suppose you're right. :)
user2: Looking back now, I think the movie was pretty meh.
user1: Yea it still has some charming moments and the like littel bit with john candy and the polka band is pretty funny
user1: i live in a huge polka town right now
user2: Only the ending action was interesting to me, with the traps and the burglars and all.
user2: You do?
user1: and man that bit cracks me up
user1: lol
user1: yea
user2: Polka as in the musical genre?
user2: Honestly, I don't even recall a polka scene.
user1: Its not so much a scene with them playing polka
user1: but like John candy drives his mom back to chicago in a avn with a polka band
user2: Oh ya, now I remember.
user1: yea
user2: What a name though, "John Candy."
user1: He was quite the funny man before he dieed

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: User 2: are you there?
user1: The Movie we are talking about right now is Home Alone, Have you seen it?
user2: I am not sure
user2: Is it a recent movie
user1: Its a 90's American comedy from John Huges staring Macaulay Culkin
user2: I think there was more than 1 of that movie series, some I saw, some I did not
user2: is this the 1st one
user1: This is the Original where the Family mistakenly leaves him Home while taking a trip to Paris for their Christmas Vacation 
user2: I don't think I saw that one, I remember one about being lost in a big City, NY or LA
user2: what happens in the original movie
user1: Basically the same cast with Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern trying to break into the family home, Obviously being foiled by the youngster in a hilarious way 
user2: Joe Pesci I like, mostly from gangster movies
user2: Stern I am not real familiar with
user1: Very good comedy duo, You should watch it 
user1: Pesci Plays Harry and Stern Plays Marv, do you like Comedies?
user2: What ever happened to these guys, Pesci I have not seen in a long time.  And M. Culkin, did he ever do anything other than this series of movies
user1: I have no idea, While the movie was scored low by critics it did well enough to get more movies LOL 
user2: Do you know if home alone is available on Netflex or the other streaming outlets
user1: I do not know, 
user2: Joe pesci is 75 and alive, but no recent credits listed
user2: Culkin, now looks pretty odd by what I just looked up on IMBD
user2: But maybe that was a role he is playing
user1: There is also another guy in the movie that played Gus... "the Polka King"... He was funny and helped the Mother get back to Kid
user2: Gus, that is John cabdy, he died a few years back, overdose I think
user2: John CANDY
user1: He Did a good Job in the Movie, Poor Lady had to Listen to that Polka music though LOL 
user2: I looked on my Roku, and Home Alone is available to rent, but not free on any of the channels.
user2: $2.99
user1: It's a Christmas movie, always out on TV for free around then 
user2: too much other free stuff, so I would need to be convinced it is worth the $2.99
user2: or wait until next Christmas like you said
user1: You get to see the Original, He rigs up the whole house, Numerous traps that hurt the Burglars in Original ways
user2: John Candy was very funny, but he like a lot of other of his generation comedians was pretty self destructive, such as
user1: The Burglars call themselves the Wet banits in that one 
user2: John Belusi, overdose
user1: No drugs in this one LOL 
user2: Chris Farley too
user2: Ok, I am going to sign off now, I will catch the movie at xmas time

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user2: Hi there, how are you
user1: Good, and yourself?
user2: Doing well, thanks! So....Home Alone
user1: Never watched! WHATS IT ABOUT?
user2: WHAT?! Well Home Alone is actually about a boy who was, lets guess it, left HOME ALONE
user2: His parents went on vacation, and forgot him!
user1: Sounds vaguely familar!
user1: Whose in the cast?
user2: The main character is Macaulay Culkin, and his parents are Catherine O'Hara and John Heard
user1: I've heard a little about them. How were the critics reviews?
user2: The critics thought the first half was bland, but the second half was much more humorous 
user1: Oh i bet! Whats the genre?
user2: I'd consider it a Comedy
user1: Nice! can you tell me more about it?
user2: Of course! The movie came out in 1990 (and there was a sequel after). Ratings by various media outlets were vastly different. Some gave it mediocre reviews, while others gave it good reviews
user1: Sounds like the typicial classic response
user1: how did the sequel do?
user2: From what I remember it did just as well. The plot was extremely similar, as you'd imagine. With that said, the movie was just as entertaining as the first, in my opinion.
user1: That's great to hear! I love comedy movies so this seems like my type of movie
user2: Yes, I highly recommend it! Not only that, but it's quite popular, and can be used as a conversation piece with friends.
user1: How so?
user2: Well, if someone were to mention the movie to you, you wouldn't be able to partake in the conversation. If you go and see it, then you will!
user1: Can you tell me about a scene so i can better picture the movie?
user2: A major part of the movie is how two individuals try and break into the home while the main character Kevin is alone. During this process Kevin comes up with different ideas to deter the individuals from gaining access to the house. In one scene he does so by having a can of paint swing by a rope, and eventually hitting one of the men. 
user1: Oh no! That sounds quite painful but nonetheless hilarious!
user1: So the two burgulars are two men?
user2: It was indeed, and now gives you more of a reason to go see it!
user2: Yes, both are men
user2: One tall and skinny, the other short and chubby
user1: quite the opposites!
user1: Did kevin get hurt at alll throughout the film?
user2: Hm, I think if I told you that, It'd take away from the movie
user2: But I will say that he did indeed make it to the sequel.!
user1: Awesome! How did his parents react when they came back?
user2: From what I recall he didn't tell them what had happened. Nonetheless they were extremely happy that he was safe and sound at home. 
user2: As you could expect, they were just happy to see him. 
user1: i Bet they were, anyone i feel would be content
user2: yes, i could imagine so

conversation:
user1: Hi!  What is the name of the movie we will be talking about?
user2: The movie is home alone. You should watch it if you havent seen it! Did you know it didnt get the best ratings? 
user1: I didn't realize that it did not get good ratings!  It came out quite a while ago didn't it?
user2: Yes, it is an older movie, maybe thats why the ratings seem to be middle rate. The critical responses compliment their comedy in the movie though, so id think the ratings would line up with those. 
user1: Was't that a holiday movie?
user2: Yes, wouldnt it be nice to vacation in paris for christmas? Im curious to know what the father did for a living 
user1: He took his whole family I believe!!!  I would definitely like to know his occupation and have it!!  What was that kids name that starred in it?
user2: His name was kevin. He sure was a savy little kid keeping those robbers at bay! Not sure my 8 year old could handle that!
user1: I know mine couldn't!  I could only imagine what my house would look like if I went off without him for any length of time!  
user2: Absolutely! Marv and harry the robbers would get away with everything if it happened in real life at my house. It was surely a unique concept for a comedy movie in 1990!
user1: Weren't their sequels to it?
user2: I dont know! I do think kevin getting sent to the third floor for punishment seems silly. Being thats why they managed to leave him behind, i assume thatll no longer be a punishment at the mccallister house!
user1: I would hope not!  Didn't he have to sleep with the bed wetter?
user2: Haha! I dont remember that! I had also forgotten it was based outside of chicago. That explains the winter storm they got the night before they left for the airport!
user1: oh yeah! That reminds me of the old man that all the kids were scared of that shoveled the snow!
user2: Im unsure of his name. Im sure there was plenty to be scared of as an at home alone 8 year old boy!
user1: Can you imagine how his mom felt??
user2: She was the only one able to fly back at first! I imagine she didn't enjoy travelling from pennsylvania to chicago with a polka band either! 
user1: That had to be a nightmare!  Wasn't the polka guy a well known actor?
user2: All i know about him is his name was gus in home alone! Its crazy kate, kevins mom, didnt know he was missing until half way to Paris!
user1: Yes, i couldn't imagine losing a kid!!  B
user1: but they had a load full heading to the airport!
user2: They sure did! Lots of cousins and kevins brother buzz as well. I bet they wished they had battery backed up alarm clocks when they woke up almost missing their flight!
user1: Lol!! Yes!  Buzz was mean to Kev if i remember right.  I am sure he was worried when his brother was home alone though.
user2: Oh, waa marley the old man with the snow shovel? He knocked out the burglers before they could harm kevin! Seems like the old man saved the day
user1: Yes!!  And kevin helped him reunite with his son!!  
user2: Funny how after it all, Buzz was worried about what Kevin did to his room. Typical mean older brother I suppose.
user1: Yeah, typical.  Did Kevin lose one of Buzz's pets?  Or maybe he just used it in his assault on the robbers
user2: It may have been part of one of his many booby traps he used against the two burglers!
user1: He was pretty crafty!  And frugal when he went shopping.
user2: Yes he was pretty crafty rigging all those traps. Its a shame they still grabbed him in the end. Lucky for kevin that marley was there ro help! 
user1: Yes it was!!  I feel like i need to watch the movie now!
user2: It was nice discussing this with you! I do as well! 
user1: You too! Enjoy the movie!

conversation:
user2: Hey there!
user1: Hello, how are you?
user2: Pretty good! What movie do we have today?
user1: Home Alone, have you seen it?
user2: Wow. A long, long time ago. I forgot a lot about it though. :)
user1: It is such a great movie, I can't believe it was only rated a 63/100
user1: To each their own I guess
user2: I remember it stars Macaulay Culkin (had to look up that spelling), but I don't remember the name of the two burgers.
user2: The actors, rather.
user1: This movie is my childhood, I watched it so many times.
user1: Joe Pesci played the short guy
user2: burgers, wow. Burglars*
user1: And Daniel Stern played the taller guy.
user2: What! How did I not know that it was Joe Pesci.
user2: What year did it come out? I'm guessing ... mid 90s?
user1: Yeah, exactly 1990
user2: Haha, wow. Coming right out of the 80s.
user2: It has that feeling, too. Of a sort-of 80s movie.
user1: The best part in the first was him running around the house all excited after his family left to the airport.
user2: Yeah! Wow. I really should watch this again.
user2: I remember seeing clips of it later and realizing how horribly dead the two burglars would be if even one of those "traps" got them.
user1: Yeah, the paint buckets to the face on the stairs.
user2: Who directed it, if you have that info?
user1: Chris Columbus, not familiar off the top of my head
user2: Hm... that rings a bell, but I don't remember what else he did.
user2: ... beyond the famous explorer, of course :P
user1: It would not be a movie to make now with everyone and society, leaving their child home is child abuse.
user2: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that. A lot of moves from the late 70s to the mid 90s would never be made now.
user1: Yeah, it's a shame, but not much we can do except enjoy and chose which ones to watch.
user2: Do you have any of the plot info? Anything that seems surprising or something that you forgot?
user1: I forgot that his mom was played by Catherine O' Hara, the crazy woman from Beetlejuice
user1: Have a good day!
user2: Have a great day!

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you todya?
user1: good, did you see the movie ?
user2: Yeah, I did way too many times.
user2: How about you?
user1: Yes a long time a ago, it seems that I liked more than the critics 
user2: Same here, but the second one was much better.
user1: Even the user average is not very good (55%)
user2: I can't believe that this movie came out almost 30 years ago.
user1: What did you liked about the film ?
user2: I did not like Kevin that much, but I really love the two bandits that try to rob the house.
user2: Those two guys are extremely funny.
user1: I like slapstick humor, so same thing for me
user1: How did you like the beginning of the movie ?
user2: The beginning of the movie was chaotic and very stressful with all that commotion and noise.
user2: Which part of the two bandits being tortured do you like the most?
user1: Yeah, it was unnecessarily complicated. They could have simplified the plot. 
user1: But at the same, you needed a lot of people and chaos to justify that they forgot Kevin in the house.
user2: Yes. 
user2: Men Caulking is having a hard life these days
user2: What rating would you give this movie?
user1: We should keep the conversation to the movie. I don't remember that it took this long before the burglars come to the house, maybe that why the critics are so harcsh.
user2: No, it takes about 20 minutes no matter what.
user1: As I remember the film, I would have given it 80%. Now that I see the details of the film maybe 60%.
user2: Home Alone is a 1990 Comedy Movie directed by Chris columbus.
user1: What rating would give this movie ?
user2: I would give it a 70% rating.
user1: How did you find the ending ?
user2: The ending was ok but a little too much Drama.
user2: Did you know the actor playing as Kevin died 2 years ago?
user1: I think it should have ended in a more funny way instead of mixing it up with good sentiments.
user2: Yes, I know what you mean. This move ending is just plain.
user2: John Heard Kevin father died about 2 years ago from heart dissease. 
user1: It is though to end with a joke, but they should have tried.  
user2: Cool we finished, nice talking to you. Have a nice day. Bye
user1: That a good converstion have a nive day
user2: Thanks

conversation:
user2: Hello home alone was a must see movie back in its times. What are your thoughts ?
user1: Hey there, I agree, even just the cover of a young Macauley Culkin is iconic I think.
user2: yes he is. My son love the movie so I still see it till this day. I loved joe pesci in the movie
user1: Ah yeah Joe Pesci, he was good in other movies too. Although this one didn't really fit his usual Italian mafia movies that I'd associate him with.
user2: and I dont know why rotten tomatos would give it such a low score
user1: Agreed, some of the movies RT gave a high score to were absolutely horrid compared to Home Alone.
user2: now I only like the 1st ones the sequels were not as good
user1: I liked 2 but 3 was subpar, especially since they used a different kid, so it just wasn't the same.
user2: you are right they should had the same kid it the movie. I think I would watch it now
user2: and it is a good chiristmas movie too
user2: hello are you there ?
user1: yes sorry, I'm reviewing the new document
user2: ok my fav scene is when they all reunited back at home.
user1: Mine was when he outsmarted them on the staircase with traps and such. I actually didn't remember that they were going to Paris or that they lived in Chicago
user2: I liked it even more cause it was baces in my hometown chicago
user1: Ah yeah it's always fun to recognize streets or landmarks that you've been to in real life, in a movie haha
user2: yes it was so true to home. 
user1: Hah I didn't remember the scene with the temporary power outage and that being the reason why Kevin was accidentally left home alone
user2:  ha ha. I always wonder how parents could leave the kid at hom ein the first place
user1: that's a solid point
user1: Perhaps that's the reason why RT gave it a low score was because of how "unrealistic" it was, but like I said they have given so many bad movies a great rating. and they usually weren't any more realistic
user2: but the they leave him alone after that there are more movies
user2: it really is a fun movie to watch
user1: Reading this is like almost like rewatching the movie to me. Scranton PA isn't THAT far away from Chicago, maybe 8-9hour drive at the most? that wouldn't even be the most dramatic part of that situation
user2: I do agree with you
user1: I wonder why Kevin was "silent",.what kind of kid wouldn't tell their parents about some burglars? lol
user2: lol  or niebhors or anyone. I mean he did not have a cell but he had a house phone
user1: I have to wonder if RT did a retroactive rating or that was their rating at the time, I don't know how long that organization has been around for 
user2: i think from the mid 2000. I want to see this  at the show 28 years ago
user1: yeah it says 1998 I just looked it up
user2: what was the stupidest thing from the movie to you ?
user1: well I dont know about stupidest but I like when the kid ordered a pizza and then played a sound recording of a guy saying "leave it on the door step and get the hell out of here"
user2: I agree to that one lol

conversation:
user2: Home Alone, 1990.
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user1: Yes, I always found it crazy how the mom forgot one of the children.
user2: YES!! Like, how does that happen?
user1: I mean, if I had to sympathize, the parents did have a lot of children.
user2: Still.Catherine O'Hara plays the forgetful Mom. 
user2: John Heard plays the dad (who is equally at fault in my book)
user1: LOL yes. The traps that Kevin devised were sinister. 
user2: I'm Surprised the reviews were so low at 62%.
user2: I found it a great movie.
user1: I mean I'm not. The movie kind of was adult-bashing.
user2: Yes, his traps were hilarious.
user2: Yeah, I guess so.
user2: They were the kind of traps that any 8-year-old could devise
user1: Yes, they were hilarious though.  
user1: That's where I disagree
user1: lol
user1: I'm suprised they haven't done a reboot of Home Alone.
user2: If he had tens of thousands of dollars and a crew of movie special effects people
user2: Yes. They are rebooting everything else
user2: Oh Buzz. Buzz, Buzz. And that tarantula, lol.
user1: LOL 
user1: do you normally watch movies with bad ratings?
user2: Probably...not realizing it, lol. I try to research first.
user2: I forgot their house had a third floor.
user1: Very big house! The burglars were scary. 
user2: Especially Mr. Gold tooth....Marv I think
user1: I think so, yeah. They looked more like hobos lol
user2: Or maybe he was Harry. I havent seen it in soooo long
user2: The old neighbor guy was scary at first too.
user1: Sadly, I don't remember the old neighbor.
user2: Poor kid, wakes up, alone, on Christmas.
user2: No family in sight. No santa. 
user2: In the days before cell phones
user1: I agree the film first half was flat and unsurprising. I saw it coming a mile away.
user2: How did Cinema Score give this movie an A, when the other two clearly didnt like it so much.
user2: John Hughes pulls our strings like he'd never learn to do anything else
user1: There seems to be a distinction between rotten tomatoes score and cinema score
user2: I forgot the burglars raid all the houses, not just his.
user2: And that Polka band, lol.
user2: Marley is the old neighbor guy's name.
user2: Looks like Harry and Marv never get their revenge on Kevin.
user2: Well, in this movie at least.
user2: They go to Paris for christmas.
user2: That must be fun.
user1: What a strange place to go for christmas, don't you think?

conversation:

user1: Hello 
user2: how r u? did u watch the movie home alone?
user1: I'm great. How are you? Yes I have. 
user1: Are you familiar with the actors in Home Alone? 
user1: It is one of my favorite movies. 
user2: nope
user2: but i like the mvie
user1: I thoroughly enjoy how the character Kevin has to stay safe from the two bad guys. 
user1: Do you know the names of the bad guys in the movie? 
user1: I honestly haven't heard of any of these people until now. I only ever knew them by their character names.
user2: i dnt know the faces but i remeber those charachters
user1: I am very familiar with Macaulay Culkin. 
user2: hmmm
user2: what was the bad chars name?
user1: The movie was created in 1990. I was very young when it came out, but I don't remember seeing it in 1990.

user1: Do you remember the Dad's name? 
user1: Aside from Mr. McCallister. lol 
user2: yeah
user1: Do you know the popular producer who wrote the movie? 
user2: but the movie rating is average in rotten tomatoes
user1: That's so peculiar to me. In my opinion it's seriously one of the best movies of my childhood. 
user2: i dnt know the producer but i know the director
user1: I've only ever heard of the producer, John Hughes. 
user2: chris coloumbus
user1: One of my favorite scenes is when Kevin sets up the traps and makes Harry and Marv think there's people dancing in the living room! 
user1: What's your favorite scene? 
user1: I cannot believe that "Rotten Tomatoes" gave it a rating of 62%. Do you agree with that rating? 
user2: some what i dnt agree with that rating
user2: what about u?
user2: unfortunately my favorite scene also the same as yours 
user1: As I said before, it's one of my favorite movies from my childhood. Even as an adult I think it deserves a rating of at least 85%. Actually, a rating of 90%. 
user2: hmmm
user1: Do you typically enjoy movies of this genre; comedy? 
user2: not like that
user1: What genre do you typically enjoy watching? 
user2: but i prefer to watch thriller and sci fi movies 
user2: what type of movies u watch generally?
user1: Those are literally the exact movies I watch. Haha 
user1: I do enjoy a good thriller, but nothing scary. 
user2: haha
user1: I enjoyed all of the Taken movies with Liam Neeson. 
user1: Did you see the newest It movie? 
user2: yeah
user2: it was really good
user2: movie
user2: i like it very much
user1: A lot of people told me that they really enjoyed it.
user1: That's not a movie that I would be interested in seeing. 
user1: Haha. 
user1: My husband enjoys watching all those kinds of movies. I'm typically a rom com, crude humor kind of gal. lol 
user1: Have you ever watched the second home alone movie? 
user2: ohh
user2: nope
user1: Lost in New York.
user2: i didnt watch that second part
user1: It's so much funnier than the first. 
user2: really i will watch it soon then
user2: generally i enjoy the horror movies too
user1: Since you like thrillers, you would probably enjoy the newer movie, Get Out. Have you seen that yet? 
user2: i have seen the trailer but i didnt watch the movie
user2: what was your recent movie?
user1: It was so good! I actually did go and see that movie. lol 
user1: Gosh...the most recent movie I've seen was Moana. haha
user1: I have kids so we typically watch a lot of kids movies in my house. haha
user1: This Christmas we actually let our kids watch Home Alone for the first time. They were glued to the tv. 
user2: oh really
user2: thats so nice

conversation:
user1: Hello there.  Do you like comedy movies?
user2: Hi... Yes I do. 
user2: How about you?
user1: Do you like Macaulay Culkin?
user2: He's not my favorite. I like him in this movie the best. 
user1: Have you ever seen Home Alone, a 1990 comedy film about a boy who is left behind when his family flies to Paris?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello, the movie we are discussing is home alone. 
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: The first one?
user2: yes
user1: I love that movie.
user2: Great Movie. Though the beginning to a bit to set up for the whole film.
user2: What type of humor would you consider it to be?
user1: Family friendly humor.
user2: with the elaborate booby-traps
user2: a little bit of slap stick too?
user1: Yes; I agree.
user1: It is also considered a Christmas movie.
user2: Absolutely, a cult classic. 
user2: Like a lot of John Hughes movies.
user1: Yes
user2: Would you say, if someone hasn't seen the movie that the plot line would be implausible? 
user1: I would say that, because of all the things he does, and at his young age.
user1: In the real world the kid would just call the cops.
user1: And not get forgottent by their parents.
user2: One would hope! What would you say was the most iconic scene?
user1: w
user1: What I remember is when the mom screams Kevin in the air plane.
user2: Yes! 
user1: When she realizes what happened.
user2: Plus who can forget John Candy's cameo
user2: I would say the booby-trapping of the house was another big scene
user1: Yes, he was great.
user1: The best one was heating the doorknob.
user2: Yes, that or the burning of the scalp.
user1: ouch
user2: quite painful, i still don't know how the rest of the family was able to make it on Christmas day back. 
user1: That was also fun about it.
user2: True, I believe that Macaulay Culkins real brother made a cameo in the film too.
user1: Oh, really, I didn't know that.
user2: what was his older brothers name
user2: in the movie?
user1: He had many.
user2: Buzz i think
user1: Buzz.
user2: What would you say is the number one reason to watch the movie?
user2: If someone has not seen it before?
user1: For its family friendly humor that the whole family can watch and enjoy.

conversation:
user2: Hi.  I just saw an interesting movie
user1: I really enjoyed Home Alone!
user1: It made me laugh a lot- do you like comedies?
user2: Yes I do!  I was surprised at the low rating by rotten tomatoes for this one. 
user1: I thought that Calaulay Culkin did a great performance
user2: Me 2!  Joe Pesci was great as well as Harry.
user1: Yes- The burglars were also great in this omvie
user2: I know, right!  I also enjoyed Catherine O'Hare and John Heard as Kevin's parents
user1: Who was your favorite character?
user2: Marv for sure!
user2: What about you?
user1: I think Kevin was my favorite
user1: I felt sorry for Kevin when he got left at home in the confusion
user2: Can you believe that they forgot him on their way to Paris for Christmas?
user1: it was quite sad
user2: I know!  The power outage didn't help in the confusion
user1: Especially because he is the youngest 
user2: Yes, he must have been quite surprised when his "wish" came true
user1: I bet Kate was very desperate to take a ride with the polka band
user2: No kidding.  She made it to Pennsylvania ans was determined to get home. 
user1: Christmas is always a crazy time to travel
user2: Yes, but it would be nice to travel to Paris.
user2: The booby traps in the movie are my favorite part!
user1: Kevin was so clever to make booby traps because he knew he couldn't overpower them physically
user2: He was lucky that Marley was there with his snow shovel at the end
user1: I bet Kevin was so happy when his family finally came home
user1: Do you think Buzz was mad about his room?
user2: Yes, I am sure he was happy to hear his mothers voice on xmas day
user2: I bet he was!
user1: Yes Christmas is a time to be together with family
user2: I bet his dad was confused about the gold tooth

conversation:
user1: Do you like John Hughes movies?
user2: Yes! I really enjoy Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day off, and The Breakfast Club!
user1: Then you should watch Home Alone if you haven't seen it yet!
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: I have seen Home Alone, would you recommend the sequel?
user1: Unfortunately I have never seen the sequel so I can't make a recommendation
user2: I like the first one I watch it ever Christmas.
user1: Me too, it's a classic!
user1: What's your favorite part?
user2: My favorite part of the movie is the after-shave scene. It makes me laugh everytime, how about you?
user1: I like the part when Daniel Stern is slipping and sliding all over the iced up stairs
user1: All the booby traps are kind of unbelievable but that's the fun of it all!
user1: Do you typically watch movies like that?
user2: Some of them are super painful to watch.
user2: I watch movies like that around Christmas time
user1: I'm surprised it didn't get a better rating on rotten tomatoes.  Only a 62 percent.  I would rate it higher.  Would you?
user2: I think it's a classic! But I feel like peoples opinions on movies are changing over time. It's hard to gauge audiences as time goes on.
user1: Cinema Score rated it an A.  I like their style, lol. How do you think the acting was in this film?
user2: Believable, I think all the actors represented a real-world idea of what we would consider that character.
user2: Macaulay Culkin was a good fit for the role of Kevin McCallister
user1: I agree.  I think the acting was very believable.  I was just looking at the date the film was made.  1990!  Hard to believe that was 28 years ago now
user2: The part where they are running through O'Hare airport makes me laugh, I had parents who worked in that airport. So we constantly had to do that run whenever we were late for our flight!
user1: Did you get anxiety when the family realized what had happened?
user2: It is interesting that I feel 28 years ago that would not have been a big ordeal, but now it would be all over facebook. 
user1: That is so true!  Everything gets blown up on social media these days.  It would certainly make for an interesting post when you describe your cross country trek with a polka band!
user2: Good old John Candy! It's a shame he died at the age of 43...
user1: Was he that young?  That is sad.  He was a fantastic actor.
user2: Did Kevin ever tell his Mom about the people trying to rob his house?
user1: I'm reading through the movie description and it gives me anxiety to think about a situation like that every happening in my family.  I'm putting myself in the mother's shoes and would completely freak out.
user1: You know what, I don' t think he actually did. Good point!
user2: I would think the police would have been more involved with telling the family...
user1: I would hope he told his mom that he tried to be responsible while she was away.  It was kind of cute how he decided to try to do the laundry and eat a proper meal on his own.
user1: I wonder what happened to Mcauley Culkin.  He must've given up acting.  Do you know?
user2: No he still acts, he did a lot of smaller things
user1: So independent type films?
user2: Yes, he was part of a comedy band, but they split up in 2016
user2: He is a movie with Seth Green coming out this year. Called Changeland
user1: Maybe they will do a Home Alone revival with him playing the dad.  That would be interesting.  They seem to be doing alot of those lately
user1: I will have to check it out.  I am curious to see him in present day.
user2: Yes. I think I might watch Home Alone in July now. Do a bit of Christmas early.
user2: Enjoy the rest of your day!

conversation:
user1: hello!
user2: hi
user1: Have you ever seen the movie Home Alone?
user2: Yes, a few times. You?
user1: Yes, a few times as well. I liked Macaulay Culkin as Kevin!
user2: He was great. My 8 year old son loves this movie.
user1: it was a 1990 American comedy film. 
user1: Did you know it was directed by John Hughes?
user2: I did not.
user1: some say he (john huges) was pulling our leg with this movie like none other.
user2: I assume that's a compliment?
user1: I guess so.
user1: did you have any other favorite actors in this one?
user2: Joe Pesci
user1: yes, as Harry
user2: Yup. Great character.
user1: Daniel Stern
user1: as Mary
user2: The combination is great.
user2: Marv?
user1: All the traps that kid set up was too much! and only 8 years old. You have an 8 year old! 
user1: I am sure the actor had assistance from the crew :)
user2: Lol - yes, I think Kevin is his hero!
user1: In critical reviews some say it is sadistic festival of adult-bashing 
user2: The use of the word sadistic seems a bit harsh to me.
user1: Agree, a harsh use of words. The Rotten Tomatoes score is only 62%
user2: I was actually surprised when I saw that, given how popular it still seems to many years later.
user1: I guess it isn't the most artistic of films but I don't think that is what they were going for.
user2: Agreed
user1: Christmas in Paris would be nice, too bad he missed out on it.
user2: Heh, yes!
user1: They should have had a battery back up on those alarm clocks!
user2: It wouldn't have happened today with cell phones and fitbits.
user1: right!
user1: could you imagine not knowing you left your kid behind. Mine talks to much to go missing.
user2: Oh, I know. Same here with my two!
user1: Great chat. Thanks, have a great day!
user2: Thanks! You too

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi there!
user2: How's your day going so far?
user1: Fine, thanks. Yourself?
user2: Pretty good.
user2: I have chosen the movie "Home Alone". have you watched it before?
user1: No I haven't. Could you please tell me more about it?
user2: Yes. It's an american comdey movie about a teenage boy who is left alone at home by accident over christmas holiday
user1: Can you tell me what is funny about it?
user2: so two thieves try to break in and steal from the house but the teenage boy, Kevin, tries to scare them off.
user1: Is this a movie for young kids or general audience? 
user2: I think it's suitable for both
user2: it is a family movie
user1: Any famous actors?
user2: so the role of the teenage boy, kevin, is played by Macaulay  Culkin
user1: Oh sure, I remember him. 
user1: It sounds like an interesting movie.
user2: and the two thieves are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stem
user1: I know Joe Pesci as well. 
user1: I remember him in a Lethal Weapon movie.
user1: Do you know when Home Alone was made?
user2: Oh I see.
user2: yes, it was made in 1990
user1: Sounds like a fun family-friendly movie.
user2: Yes! specially for movie nights for Christmas holidays
user1: Okay great, I might check it out!
user2: You might know the director. It was directed by Chris columbus.
user1: Actually I do know of him.
user1: He did some of the Harry Potter films
user2: oh nice!
user2: which ones?
user1: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
user1: I believe they are the first two in the series.
user2: yes! I've seen those two
user2: s
user2: in the home alone movie, kevin sets a lot of booby traps to deceive the thieves
user2: which I believe makes it a lot funny
user2: but he never tells his parents about the traps and the story
user2: and still gets called out by his brother about messing his room
user1: Oh sure, it sounds like a funny situation.
user1: Anything specific you remember from the movie?
user2: well, at the beginning Kevin wishes that his family leave him alone because he had a fight with his brother
user2: but at the end, he seems very happy to get reunited with them
user2: which gives a heart-warming feeling
user2: So let me ask you a question when you want to watch a movie, how important is the rating to you? 
user1: It's pretty important. I don't like to watch bad movies.
user2: Home Alone has a 62% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Would you choose it to watch?
user1: It seems to have a decent enough rating for a fun movie. I think I would choose to watch it.
user2: That's good!
user2: Do you have anymore questions from me?
user1: No I think that's enough information. Thanks for the recommendation.
user2: Sure!
user2: have a great day
user1: Thanks! you too.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi how are you?
user1: Good how are you ?
user2: I'm good.  Do you like comedies?
user1: Yes
user2: Do you like movies with Joe Pesci.  I really enjoy movies he is in.
user1: Yes he is funny
user2: Home Alone was a pretty funny movie.
user1: I agree. Brings back so many childhood memories.
user2: Yeah me too.  I really liked Catherine O'hara in it too as the mom.
user1: Lol yes, she's a great actor
user1: What's your favorite scene?
user2: The scene where they both realize that he was left behind.
user1: Mine is when he sets up all those traps lol pretty dang funny
user1: Lol her face was priceless
user2: Yeah they really did a good job with those
user2: I think the setup for him being left behind wasn't really realistic I think in real life someone would realize if they left their child behind. 
user1: Yes exactly. I know I would
user2: I thought they spent too much time on his family and not enough on Kevin fighting off the burgulars.
user1: Yea I agree
user1: I'm not sure what to do for this task 
user2: Who was your favorite character?
user1: Definitely kevin, yours?
user2: look at the paragraph at the top on the left and we talk about that part of the movie till it changes
user2: I liked harry best.
user1: I thought it would've changed already lol & the whole cast is really good
user1: It should've had a better rating
user2: Yeah it should have It's not the best movie of all time or anything but it was better then the critics said
user2: It kind of had a roadrunner and coyote cartoon fell to it
user2: er feel
user1: I agree but everyone has their opinions
user2: Yeah I like a lot of the director's films he did the first harry potter one
user2: actually the first two i think
user1: I love those movies
user2: yeah me too

conversation:
user2: How are you?
user1: Hello
user1: I'm doing good. 
user1: What is the movie called?
user2: A classic you have got to guess. It has a real hot shower scene.
user1: Ahh
user1: there are a lot of movies with hot shower scenes 
user2: It's from the early 90s
user1: that could be difficult 
user2: It's a guy in the shower with a recording playing
user1: Hmmm... does he have blonde hair?
user1: And is it a romance movie? Or just an accidental steamy shower scene?
user2: It's definitely got a three stooges vibe
user1: Uhh definitely a shame I've actually never watched the three stooges 
user2: Well you aren't missing much :D
user1: What genre is the movie?
user2: I'll help you out.
user1: Okay lol
user2: It's a comedy with a child actor
user1: home alone? 
user2: Ding! It opens with his family preparing to spend Christmas in Paris.
user2: A surprise to me is that the director is Chris Columbus. 
user1: I love the movie, but I'm with the director. It's such a classic do you know of any other movies that Chris Columbus directed? 
user2: Yes. Home alone 2... etc
user1: Awesome. I love all of them but I don't remember the last one that well only the first one. Not too sure why that is 
user1: Was this movie your favorite out of the bunch? 
user2: I couldn't tell you my favorite. I think no. 1 has a cameo 
user2: I could tell you some of the plot.
user2: Let me start over.. Kevin is left behind and his family doesn't realize he is missing until they arrive in Paris.
user1: thats funny 
user2: They are delayed for 2 days and stay at a relatives upon which she meets a guy in a traveling polka band who offers to drive them back.
user1: I somewhat remember that part but it's been so long 
user1: at what point did they break into the house while the parents were gone? 
user2: that's part three
user1: they didn't break in part 1? 
user2: Kevin rigs the house with traps and Harry and marv suffer injuries and Kevin calls the cops while fleeing the house.
user1: Hmm I guess I completely forget what mainly happens
user2: The paint cans, the thumb tacks, the heated door knob
user2: haha too funny.
user1: hahahaha yes it was so funny one of the best movies for it's time definitely 
user1: it's been a great time thanks for the details on the movie. 
user2: Everyone watched this in the 90s
user1: oh yeah even my late grandma 
user1: she loved it
user2: Do you remember where Trump Cameos?
user1: I think so but I actually didn't know who Trump was back then 
user1: was way too young to care
user2: Totally cool. I hope there's more movies like that while I'm still kickin'
user1: Definitely and I hope you'll be kickin' for awhile 
user2: Thanks. It's down the hall, to your left

conversation:
user1: Hello ! 
user2: Hi, I would like to chat with you about the movie Home Alone. Does that work for you?
user1: yes . Seen it many times  
user1: one of my favorites 
user2: What is your opinion of the first half of the movie?
user1: . Parental disobedience, undisciplined kid, watching violent movies, foul language, siblings bullying each other. Nested on all these are the laughs
user1: so otherwise a goodmovie 
user2: How about the booby traps Culkin constructed. Were not very fancy were they.
user1: th
user1: sorta cheesy . like did it really happen 
user1: like my own kids would never contruct anything like that . 
user2: The writer had fun bashing the adults as incompetent.
user1: yeah 
user1: overall i think it is a classic movie and just very creative
user1: fun to watch 
user2: lol.I agree with your assessment.
user1: I think the movie would get flack these days from t

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi
user1: My movie is Home Alone
user1: If you are young or have kids I think it's a great family movie
user2: Cool I have heard about that movie before. It is kind of old right?
user1: Yeah it was released in 1990
user2: Wow I was not even born yet.
user2: What is it about?
user1: It was made in the time when a family movie could contain cursing / violence / humor
user1: It's about a boy who gets left alone over Christmas while robbers try to rob his house
user2: Is it just a family movie? Or is it a comedy too?
user1: Family Comedy
user1: both
user2: Cool I like those kinds of movies.
user2: Is there any famous actors in it?
user1: Joe Pesci is one of the robbers
user2: Oh nice, he is good.
user1: and Macualay Culkin is the boy who gets left home alone
user1: It's a bit silly but I am 35 with 2 kids and we usually watch it around Christmas time every year
user2: I have heard of him. Didn't he fly off the deep end?
user1: Yeah he's a bit nuts now.  I think that's what happens to child actors sometimes
user2: Are there any sequels?
user1: Yeah there are several but I think the original is the best onie
user2: Okay. HMM do you know if it is on Netlifx or Amazon?
user1: It appears to not be available streaming for free anywhere at this moment
user1: but I know i have seen it on netflix
user1: it is on Amazon but costs money
user2: I'm sure since it is pretty old I could get a copy on dvd for cheap.
user1: that's true you could do that too
user2: Yup maybe they have it in one of those wal-mart bins where they are  a few bucks.
user1: We bought it on Google Play for around $4.00 with a coupon
user2: Oh nice I could do that too .
user1: Sometimes they offer discount HD movie rentals for like $0.99 as well

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hi how are you?
user2: Fine, thank you. What do you think about the 1990 American comedy film "Home Alone"?
user1: I like it. I think Macaulay Culkin was hilarious in it.
user2: I think it's one of the most memorable and all in all beautiful motion pictures ever.
user2: I totally agree with you.
user1: John Hughes has a lot of memorable films, including this one.
user2: And the other actors like Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who play the burglar played their role extremely well.
user1: its such a simple plot too. even though its unrealistic. its almost all in the title.
user2: What do you think about the overall plot?
user2: Yes, that is true!
user2: Do you like comedy movies?
user1: its basic, and you have to suspend some disbelief (as in the parents would have noticed much sooner), but its really well executed. I like comedy movies in general.
user1: what did you think of the scene where they miss the alarm and have to scramble to get to the airport?
user2: Yeah well the McCalliter family forgetting their youngest son is a bit too much but most viewers get past that. I love the dynamic of the family in the day of departure.
user1: I could totally imagine them getting out the door without him in a panic.
user2: Hmm, that's basically the whole pretext of why they forgot Kevin. Even if it was forced.
user2: Also the power outage contributes to the disaster by resetting the alarm clocks so the family oversleeps.
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user1: I think the ratings are surprisingly low. Its not the smartest film, but I think the ratings don't really reflect the sentiment
user2: Yes, I'd have too agree. The movie just sort of has a magic to it which the critical response doesn't really get.
user2: Another crucial moment is when the mom (Kate) discovers mid-flight that they left Kevin behind.
user1: The mom's trek back to kevin is also kinda funny. its like its own little side journey
user2: Yeah that's were that journey begins.
user1: in real life I would have imagined that she would call a friend or relative to check in on him. but that wouldn't have been as good a movie
user2: I guess that's true!
user1: flying to and from chicago during the holdiays is such a nightmare too
user2: I would imagine!
user2: Anyways, the middle and final part of the movie are the reason it's so popular and loved.
user1: when kevin starts setting up traps for the burglars is where the movie really starts to shine
user2: True! The way he rigs those traps and plans everything is amazing. Almost unbelivable for a 8 year old !
user1: I think thats why the movie is loved. every kid can relate to the situation (at least in their imagination!)
user2: What do you think about the moments when he almost got caught? What did you think will happen?
user1: its a nailbiter for  a stretch or two there.
user2: And being a comedy, in the end, the bad guys get busted because the police get there and the family is reunited with Kevin.
user2: Do you generally prefer movies with good or bad rating? Is it relevant to you?
user1: When Kevin has to answer for messing up Buzz's stuff its pretty funny.
user1: Ratings can sometimes be relevant....
user2: I agree! That is so true! 
user2: Although I prefer to know something about a movie before watching it
user2: Oh, you left, goodbye then!
user2: I think we're finished anyway.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey
user1: What do you think about the movie? 
user2: I liked it
user1: I think the critics were kind of harsh
user2: Critics tend to not see the value of dumb funny movies
user1: Yeah I guess. Do you think the premise is plausible? 
user2: Naw, but it doesn't matter, all movies tend to ask you to believe an implausible premise, but as long as they stick to their premise they tend to work
user1: Hmm, I guess. I am surprised to see it only has 62% on Rotten Tomatoes, I thought it was a classic and everyone loves it
user2: The classic status tend to only appear after a while while the movie is seen cold, it isn't the first movie that isn't well liked by the critics at the moment that they come out.
user1: Do you think it was fair that Kevin's mom punished him by sending him to the third floor/attic because he was fighting with his siblings? 
user2: Not particularly but given the size of the family it might be necessary for the sake of peace.
user1: Yeah but I always felt bad for Kevin since he was the youngest and the smallest
user2: yea, me too
user2: But the bullied little kid was an staple of the 90's cinema
user2: Sometimes they overplayed their hand
user1: Yeah I suppose. Although on the other hand the whole movie was about him learning responsibility and how to get along with his siblings better
user1: I thought it was always funny that his dad didn't seem to care too much
user2: Me not so much, the "bumbling dad and responsible mom" doesn't appeal so much to me.
user1: Do you think it's an overused trope? 
user2: Yes, mostly because as time goes by dads keep getting dumber and dumber and the moms even more perfect, to the point where one beguines to question what did she see in him
user1: True. I think it's nice that "Mrs. Doubtfire" engages with that trope and sort of gives a logical conclusion to it. But honestly I am struggling to think of a recent comedy where the dad was the responsible one and the mom was aloof
user2: The closest that you get now is either both of them are bumbling idiots or the dad is an idiot and the mom is a control freak.
user1: What do you think about Marley? 
user2: Was he the old man?
user1: Yeah
user2: Nothing in particular, he was a classic example of "don't judge a book by it's cover", I'll admit that the plot parts of the movie aren't that good, it's strengths lays in the "castle defense parts" 
user1: I think it's because the plot is directed at kids - "be nice to strangers," "get along with your siblings." It's also like a cautionary tale...like when your Mom tells you she will leave you at the store if you throw a tantrum, this movie really shows your whole family gone because of your behavior. So I guess it works on that level, it's just for kids. 
user2: Yea, I think that that was one of the things that this movie did well, the moral parts are part of the story in the same way that the comedy parts are, most of it's imitators just focus on the painful hits.
user1: Yep. Do you like this one or the sequel more? 
user2: this one, the sequel kinda went nuts with the pain
user1: Oh? I guess I don't remember the particulars, I just loved the NY setting 
user1: Do you think we are done? It says "This is the end of the document" 
user2: I like NY, but they just redid the whole plot, to the point of even repeating the same moral while cranking up the pain
user1: Yeah I suppose 
user2: An yea I think that we hit the end.
user1: Ok! Well it was nice talking to you, have a good day

conversation:
user1: I this movie was really funny.
user1: What did you think of this movie?
user2: I agree, he totally stomped them!
user2: very funny
user1: I watched this with my 11 year old grandson and we laughed alot about it together.
user2: haha, I have seen it several times as my husband loves this one
user1: Joe Pesci an Daniel Stern made awesome bad guys! 
user2: As a kid I was a little afraid of Marley
user2: my favorite was the iron to the face!
user1: It was funny about the fact that he was afraid of the furnace I can picture my kids doing that.
user1: In real life those guys would be alot more hurt than they were.
user2: Lol, they'd be going to the hospital
user1: I think so.
user2: who actually forgets their kid and leaves for vaca w out them??
user1: I know thats what I was thinking.  I also probably would travel in 1st class while they were in coach.
user1: The big brother was such a jerk to Kevin.  It wasn't even fair that he got sent to bed.
user2: ikr?
user1: If the big brother was my kid he would have been punished.
user2: parents can be jerks
user1: So can siblings and cousins.
user1: Even the uncle was an awful person I wonder who paid for the trip.
user2: paris for christmas? insane
user1: Of course they didn't find out until they were in the Paris airport. 
user1: The home was a beautiful home who would want to leave in at Christmas.
user2: right, because you would'nt notice the kid who is always getting yelled at is missing
user2: not me
user1: Well it was funny, maybe a little far fetch but it made a good movie.
user2: def far fetched but good. all the booby traps were actually funny
user1: They were funny!
user1: And I didn't like the pet Spider either.
user2: i can't believe it was made in 1990
user2: spider was so nasty
user1: I know quite awhile ago. 
user2: older than all my kids lol
user2: I think I'd have given it a better review
user1: If you see what Kevin looks like now he doesn't really look much like him now, he was so cute and the only picture I've seen of him is kinda weird. 
user2: even marley turned out to be nice
user2: he looks awful
user1: Whatever it made my  grandson and I laugh alot and it was fun to watch.
user1: The one in New York was funny too!
user1: Well I think we did enough conversing to make it a complete hit.  What do you think?
user2: I hope so!
user1: Have a good day
user2: you too

conversation:
user2: Hello there!
user1: Hi! Have you seen the movie Home Alone? 
user2: The one with Macauley Culkin fending off his house from invaders?
user2: Of course
user2: Wait no
user2: Not the first
user1: It's so cute. I haven't seen it since it first came out. 
user1: Yes, the one with Macauley
user1: And Joe Pesci was one of the would be robbers. 
user2: What makes the first worth seeing if I thought the second was just alright
user1: The ways that Macaulay pulled tricks on the robbers was hilarious. 
user1: He set up traps that were kind of like Rube Goldberg machines. 
user1: Catherine O'Hara and John Heard play his parents. I think they are good too. 

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hi
user1: Do you like Christmas movie ?
user2: yes I do and you
user2: Have you seen it before
user1: Yes I do, this is one of my favorite Christmas movie,  Home Alone
user2: When was the last time you saw it
user2: I like Home Alone and the sequels
user1: I saw it recently, it is still good even if ti is filmed in the 90s
user1: I love slapstick humor.
user2: Yeah me too
user1: But the critics were harsh, 62 % on rotten tomatoes
user2: I don't know why everybody liked that movie
user2: It was so funny
user1: I think the had too much expected, it is just a very good kids movie 
user2: I still watch it when I can
user1: But the beginning of the movie is a little slow,
user2: Have you seen the latest one
user1: No. I stopped at the second one
user2: Oh who were the stars again
user1: I don't remember
user1: The second part of the film was better
user1: When that discover that they forgot the Kevin
user2: I like that part and when the robbers come
user2: It reminds me of the old movies
user1: That is the last part. 
user1: The best one
user1: The traps were very good
user2: Yes all of it was good
user1: I think because the actors were so good at being in pain
user2: What was Kevins name in real life
user1: The name of the actor , Macaulay Culkin
user2: Oh yeah that's right.
user1: Joe Pesci was one of the robbers
user1: Well bye

conversation:
user2: I thought Home Alone 2 was okay, but it seemed very improbable and difficult to believe for the most part.
user1: I agree. I don't understand how you can forget about your kid.

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hi, I see we're talking about Home Alone
user2: so i did this one in my previous chat so i'd have a lot to talk about
user2: have you seen it?
user1: I have seen it quite a few times
user1: Have you?
user2: me too
user2: this reviewer is harsh
user1: Awesome, I loved little Macaulay Culkin
user1: Yeah he was pretty harsh
user2: haha yeah me too, this last chat reminded me of buzz, remember him?
user1: I do
user2: personally i like having my strings pulled
user2: do you know what 'cinimascore is?
user2: maybe how well it does at the box office?
user1: I think it's what the cinema owners rating is. Not entirely sure though
user1: Could be that too
user2: ok then how much they made, that's all i'd care about if i had a theatre 
user1: LOL, same
user1: You dont go into business unless you want to make money
user2: "sadistic festival of adult-bashing" dang it's just a movie bruh
user1: For real. My favorite part of the review, even though I don't agree with it
user2: ;)
user1: The movie definitely wasn't flat though
user1: I thought it was a good movie
user2: am i the first person you've been paired with in chat?

user1: okay. thank you 

conversation:
user2: Good morning
user1: Hello
user2: Have you ever watched the film 'Home Alone'?
user1: Yes
user2: What did you think of it?
user1: It was pretty funny
user2: Agreed, the reviews did not seem to match the movie, in my opinion
user1: It is a classic movie
user2: It is, and has become something of a Christmas tradition
user1: Indeed. I guess some people just have no sense of humor
user2: Yep
user2: Sure, the movie's premise is sort of far fetched, but then again, so are most films
user1: I'm sure there are worse movies out there
user2: Certainly...
user2: Though this is not one of them. :)
user1: What did you think of the actors?
user2: Joe Pesci makes me laugh, even when he is not trying to
user1: Would you say he's the best actor in the movie?
user2: Probably, although the kid was quite good too, all things considered
user1: What would you rate the film, overall?
user2: I definitely would have rated it higher than the 62% that it got from Rotten Tomatoes
user2: The scoring does not show IMDb, which I would be curious to see the rating on
user1: Me too. 62% is pretty low
user2: As you said, it is a classic
user2: My family and I always watch it during the holidays
user1: I haven't seen it in a while
user2: I think we watched it and the sequel twice this past holiday season
user1: I think they remade the movie with some new kid
user2: Even when I know what is about to happen, I still crack up
user2: They did do that, those movies were not nearly as good, from what I had heard
user1: Most remakes never live up to the original
user2: You are correct there
user1: Did you ever feel bad for the bad guys?
user2: Well, in this case, not so much, they brought it on themselves

conversation:
user1: Do you agree with what the critics said about Home Alone?
user2: Not really, I mean, it seems like they are pulling it apart a little too much and forgot to watch it from an entertaining angle. What do you think?
user1: I agree with you. To be honest, I rarely agree with critics. Do you consider the opinions of critics when deciding to watch a film?
user2: I really don't. Sometimes, I'll check in to see what people think, but usually I avoid critics so I can watch the movie fresh without anybody's opinions in my head. Did you like the slapstick humor in this movie?
user1: I do, but I think I have fond memories of it from when I was a kid. I'm not sure how I would feel reacting as an adult watching it for the first time. Did you watch it as a kid?
user2: Totally. I did watch it as a kid. I think the slapstick works better here because Kevin talks to the camera. I thoroughly related to him with his older brother, reminded me of my own brother! I loved Catherine O'Hara in this too!
user1: Oh yeah! I think the technique of breaking the fourth wall works. It reminds me a bit of Ferris Bueller's Day Off in that respect. I don't think you see that as much in films these days. 
user2: You're right, you don't see it much these days. Perhaps, it's the charm of John Hughes that made it work so well. I think if it happened today it would only come off as cheesy. How much did you want one of those recorders as a kid, after seeing this film?
user1: I wanted one so badly. I think my sister got one but I didn't. But as an adult I want the house. I always kind of wondered how the family afforded the house in the film.
user1: Do you like Joe Pesci in the film?
user2: Oh man, tough break! I wondered the same about the house. It's funny to rarely have thought of how people paid for things, but then wondering how a fictional family could afford the house in a movie. And how amazing to live in that house and be able to take the entire family to Paris.  
user2: I did like Pesci! I was just going to say that Pesci and Stern were perfectly cast! 
user2: How about Daniel Stern? He was in so many movies during that time.
user1: He was good! I'm actually not super familiar with his other work though, so I'll have to look some of them up. Did you think the part where they forgot Kevin was believable? 
user2: I liked the crazy morning freakout when the family is awakened by the airport van service and I think because there are sooo many people involved, it makes it more plausible that Kevin could be forgotten. What do you think?
user1: Pretty believable. You would think that at least one person would have noticed though! Kevin's probably still in therapy from being forgotten. Between being forgotten and his siblings, I would be. What did you think about the family interaction in the film?
user2: Oh yeah, or that his Mom would have thought of him sooner. I thought the family interactions were delightfully exaggerated, like everyone is acting out at the same time, but I always hated that Kevin's uncle treated him so disdainfully. I suppose it's necessary to have a bit of a villian in the family to keep it interesting. Do you think Frank was necessary to the story?
user1: I don't think he was necessary to the storyline, but he added to the mood of the film. There are some cool online theories suggesting that he was behind the crime! Do you think the traps Kevin set up were believable?
user2: Ha! I've never seen those theories, but, I mean, he's kind of the skeevy type to try that! I think that they did a great job of suspending disbelief while watching the film, so that you are just in the moment. Certainly, pulling all of that off in reality would cause so much more harm than shown in the movie, but I do think they do a good job of making it believable in the context. Probably the play on old timey slapstick and old cartoons helps sell this. Do you think the traps were believable? I don't know if I would've ever thought to do any of that!
user1: Some of them were. The trip wire and the BB gun were. The flamethrower was maybe harder to believe. I'm more impressed that an 8 year old kid came up with them, but some of them seemed kind of deadly! Do you think it made sense for the Mom to try and rush back, or should she have contacted someone back home to go check on Kevin? That seems like it would make more sense than leaving him home alone that whole time.
user2: I know, I'm amazed anyone could live through them, but, I guess it is a comedy! It would be too much of a bummer for someone to die. :\  If it were me, I'd try to rush back as well, but I also would've been calling everyone I know to go check on him. I feel like if they had all of that money, they probably knew a TON of people and at least one family would be home during the holidays. I liked the addition of the polka band driving Kate back to Chicago, how about you?
user1: I did like that! I would have liked to see the polka band figure a little more prominently. It's such a fun addition to have. Do you think it's believable that Kate would have had such a hard time getting back home?
user2: Yes, it was pretty fun. And added some levity to her dire situation. As a kid, it seemed totally believable. Now, it's easy for me to wonder, with all that money, why didn't she rent a car or get a bus ticket, or hire a cab or.... But they did do a good job making every option seem absolutely impossible. 
user1: I would also think the airline companies would have tried to help her more. Or that someone would have at least offered to contact the police for help, given that this was a child by themselves. But then we wouldn't have had the fun polka moving van scene! What did you think about Catherine O'Hara as Kate?
user2: I love Catherine O'Hara as Kate! I think she has the ability to pull off all the exasperation, anger, worry, etc. both with her voicings and facial expressions to put forth a believable Mom.  Did you like the interaction that Kevin had with Marley?  
user1: I think I was actually more moved by the scenes with Marley than by most of the film. And it was funny because I remember having neighbors I was scared of as a kid too! But I was really moved by the reuniting of Marley with his family and Kevin with his. Why do you think Kevin kept quiet about the burglars?
user2: I agree, I found the scenes with Marley very moving and I thought that it was such a good thing to portray, knowing that millions of kids would be watching this, learning something about how to treat people, how we perceive others. I always wondered why he kept quiet about the burglars! Maybe he thought he would be the one in trouble? Or that the situation was fixed because the police took care of it? I don't know. What do you think?
user1: If I'm not being cynical, I think he didn't want to scare his family with what happened when he was left. If I'm being cynical, I think it's because he didn't trust them or was worried they would be angry with him. Why do you think Marv liked to flood the houses as his calling card? Why not just rob them?
user2: Yeah, I think you are right. He probably was so relieved that Kate had returned, soon followed by the rest of the family, that he didn't want to make them any more upset. I think Marv was obsessed with being a revered criminal and wanted to have a "thing". This just adds another element to his "idiotic" nature, because it would give you away more than anything! You could just get in and out without leaving a clue. I thought that is was a good addition to his character because it brought out more regarding the two men's working dynamic. Don't you think?
user1: Oh definitely! I think he let his ego get to him. Did you like the ending with Buzz getting upset about the room?

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi there.
user1: How are you today?
user2: I'm great thanks. Just finished watching an awesome comedy
user1: Really? Which comedy?
user2: The movie is called Home Alone, i don't know if you've seen it
user1: I have
user1: I like it very much
user2: Well it did receive a CinemaScore of A 
user1: Really? That’s great
user1: But CinemaScore’s reviews are never really that good in my opinion..
user2: Well its rotten tomatoes score was 62%
user1: Well, yeah. RottenTomatoes is always very harsh with the reviews.
user1: Which one do you think is more fair?
user1: Cinemascore’s or RT’s?
user2: Personally i would have give in it an A like the cinemascore
user1: Right
user1: I’d give it a B really
user2: Especially with such a good cast like Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern
user1: Have you seen any other films with them?
user2: Yeah a few, but i think this one was special because Chris Columbus Directed it.
user1: Well, I didn’t know that.
user1: That really is an interesting fact.
user2: One of the most memorable scenes was when Kate discovers that Kevin is missing while on the plane.
user1: Yeah?
user1: I mostly remember the pranks
user1: The thing with the heated doorknob and so on.
user2: i remember it, i also liked when she was travelling with a Polka band
user1: A polka band? Well, I don’t really remember anything about a polka band.
user2: It was when a guy overheard the mother and he offered to take the mother with him
user1: Well, it seems like I’m gonna have to rewatch the film.
user1: Do you know how long it is?
user2: Definitely, but i do remember the pranks too, and especially the booby traps Kevin made.
user1: Yeah
user1: The movie is very imaginative and innovative.
user2: I am not sure how long it is, maybe you can check online about that.
user1: Okay, I’ll be sure to check later
user1: So, would you recommend someone to watch this movie?
user2: Yea, I enjoyed it. even with all the characters that fill the plot.
user1: Great chat. 
user1: Bye
user2: Bye

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi
user2: What year is the film from?

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Wow. Just saw Home Alone. Crazy how the kid was in that.
user2: i know
user2: i love that movie 
user2: is a classic
user1: its pretty crazy
user2: what is ur favorite part?
user1: no one liked the first part of the movie but apparently the second part was real fantastic
user1: i gotta agree
user1: what was yours?
user2: hmmm i think  when he was getting all the groceries from the store to his house
user1: I liked the last talk with Kevil and Marley
user1: the groceries part was cool too, imo
user1: *Kevin
user2: and ofocurse pretty funny when the 2 guys tried to go into the house
user2: and they get their butts kicked
user1: that part was real good
user1: the beginning of it with the family going out to Paris was real bland
user2: jow pesci was a great adittion to the movie
user1: whoa, what
user1: Joe Pesci was in it?
user2: yes
user2: ???
user1: I forgot lol
user1: he was in it
user2: he is a pretty good actor
user1: hes got a real funny name too
user1: the double
user2: u think ?
user1: yeah!
user1: the last third of the movie was probably the best but I think the second was most interesting
user2: well i might watch tonight again
user2: yea
user1: it's a movie you can watch a lot of times for sure
user2: yea 
user2: i agree
user1: Marley was the old guy Kevin finds, right?
user2: i didnt know chris columbus was the the director
user1: he saves Kevin at the end and the police put the adults in jail
user2: he is amazing
user1: whoa, he's pretty good
user1: good conversation, I enjoyed talking with you.
user1: I'll see you

conversation:
user1: Good Morning, have you seen the original Home Alone before?
user2: Yes, I've seen the original Home Alone, it brings back childhood memories.
user1: Oh yes i cant believe it was made in 1990
user2: I personally like this movie, because it reminds me of my childhood, the character shows ideas when I was a kid of how to deal with perpetrators. I guess you start looking for creative ways to protect yourself.
user2: Did you know the main character was a drug addict? Pretty much change my views on him. 
user1: Yes i found out that macaulay culkin is not in a good place haha
user2: I believe it was his parents that didn't discipline him, and this movie is very opposite.
user1: oh yes very much so but again i love how this portrays kids and how creative they are 
user2: What was the you favourite part of the movies?
user1: obvsiously when the 2 bad guys trip the traps!
user1: and you?
user1: i honestly dont even remember the indivicual traps
user2: I'm not sure when why rotten tomatoes gave this movie a low score. I think it's the it needs a remake.
user2: For me the heating doorknob. 
user1: yea this seriously would be a great choice to remake especially with how much tech changes we have had since 1990 i would love to see how they protray kids how
user1: now*
user2: They probably have ipads, and I'm not sure how they will millennial set traps with that
user1: they wouldnt thats the thing ha
user2: The parents in the movie, I can't believe they left a eight year old boy back home.
user2: First of all how did they even miss their kid? I guess back then security wasn't tight at all.
user2: Have you ever been in Chicago?
user2: Do you know what Rube Goldberg Machines are?

conversation:
user1: Hello! Do you agree with the ratings of this movie?
user2: Hello! I think Rotten Tomatoes should have given it a higher score, I thought it was better than just average. What about you?
user1: I agree that it was better than average, but after reading some critical responses I can see where they are coming from in their scores.
user2: I can agree with that as well. Did you like the movie overall then?
user1: I did like the movie, but it was rather predictable. I agree with the statement that the beginning is flat and unsurprising since you can imagine how the plot will proceed based off of the title alone.
user2: I agree. I felt like I can totally agree with the statement saying its totally the kind of traps that any 8 year old could devise if he had a budget of ten thousand dollars and a film crew. I don't think any 8 year old could do all of that. 
user2: sorry that.
user1: Agreed. His traps definitely make the film seem implausible; but the slapstick humor certainly can be enjoyed by some.
user2: Who was your favorite character in the movie comedy wise?
user1: Comedy wise, I enjoyed Kevin the most. He was enjoyable in the final scenes, and the stunts he did lend him to being the most humorous I believe.
user2: Totally. Could you believe the scene with the winds causing a power outage, what bad luck.
user1: It did seem like bad luck, but almost too much of a coincidence that it would happen to them and cause their alarm clocks to malfunction exactly the night before they needed to be awake early for their trip.
user2: Agreed. Do you usually watch movies with an average score?
user1: I like to watch movies that I find interesting based off of their trailers mostly, but critic scores do have an effect on whether I will pay see a movie while it is still in theaters. I'm not sure I would pay to see a movie at the cinema that is only a 5.5/10 on rotten tomatoes.
user2: I feel the same way. I feel like Rotten tomatoes can be harsh sometimes as well. I mean look at the CinemaScore, it gave Home Alone an A.
user1: But it can also be accurate! Do you think that the plot could be predicted before the scene when Kevin wishes his family would disappear? Or did that scene make you realize what was happening... or even maybe you didn't realize it until it happened?
user2: That scene made me realize what was about to happen. Like the universe was aligning with this 8 year old boys little wish. I could not believe it took the family until Mid flight to notice he was missing.
user1: I agree, I feel like if I had a family that large, I would be checking and counting constantly to make sure I had all of my family members always present.
user2: Right always doing a head count constantly
user1: Do you think it was probable for all of the flights they needed to get home to really be booked like they were?
user2: No, I feel like they could have found something, again everything going the worst it could.
user1: Yeah, it seems unlikely that so many things could go wrong with their trip and they never caught a break.
user2: I do love the final scene though when the family returns what about you?
user1: Yeah, it was touching that they were able to reunite on Christmas day.
user2: I loved the way he was so disappointed and then they made an entrance of course.
user1: It was crazy that Kevin was able to hide everything that happened - almost!
user2: You can never hid everything from your family, someone will always find out something happened one way or the other I feel like.
user1: That's true. I wonder what Peter was thinking when he found the gold tooth on the floor.
user2: Overall, I would say I did enjoy the movie and if I had to give it a rating out of ten I would have given it a 5.

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: have you seen Home Alone?
user1: it's such an old movie
user2: Yes, I just watched this movie.
user2: What do you think about this movie?
user1: I loved it. I watch it every time it comes on TV
user1: It has that nice festive feeling to it
user1: I can never get bored of it
user2: Yeah, I have a similar attitude towards this movie.
user2: Although it is old, it is one of the best comedy movies I have watched.
user1: I like the cast in the movie and Macaulay Culkin has done a great job
user1: It's always fun to see how he tricks the thieves
user2: Yeah, he was just a boy but did a good job in the movie.
user1: did you watch the sequel too?
user2: Yes, but I like the first one.
user2: Do you still remember the scene how Kevin was left behind?
user1: yes, he was grounded for misbehaving and has to sleep in the attic
user1: the next day his family leaves without realizing
user2: Great, you remember the scene perfectly.
user2: It is bad that Kevin's parents even did not realize the missing of Kevin until flight's taken off.
user1: Yes, I wonder if it could happen in real life
user2: Maybe. But Kate, Kelvin's mother experienced so much trouble to get back home.
user2: It is common during Christmas.
user2: I just realized that the movie received a score of 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. That is low.
user2: What do you think about the movie ratings?
user1: I wonder why
user1: I don't always trust critics
user2: Me too. The ratings provided by Rotten Tomatoes are so low.
user2: Do you know who is the director of this movie?
user1: chris columbus
user2: I am not very familiar with this director, but Macaulay Culkin is so cute.
user2: I was amazed that he came up with so many interesting traps used in the movie.
user1: yes he is
user2: Which trap do you like?
user1: stairs

conversation:
user1: I honestly loved the movie. It is a classic. However, I am always left wondering as to how they could have left their child at home... that's part of the comedy though! The comedy was always jumpy. Like jump scare tactics from horror movies.... 
user1: Slapstick Humor: JumpScare Tactics
user2: I loved this movie too, so funny all the way through. I have wondered how could the parents have forgot about him and he got left behind at home too! But it was a hilarious movie!
user2: sadistic festival of adult-bashing
user2: Macaulay Culkin and Kevin Mccallister were perfect in this movie, and it took place during a really busy time of year, at christmas time. 
user1: Yeah it was! The booby traps were definitely sophisticated... But in my opinion it made the movie that much more hilarious! Like how could these burglars get tricked by this little 8 year old! Wow
user2: Exactly! Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were definatley tricked by the little 8 year old. That was the humour to this comedy through out.
user2: Macaulay Culkin playin as the 8 year old kid Kevin McCalister , I will always remember from this movie, who outwitted two grown up men playing the burglars
user1: I did however would have liked to know more about the family though... I mean what kind of job must the parents have in order to afford an amazing vacation for  11 children and themselves! That is nuts. 
user1: No wonder the burglars ( Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) wanted to rob them. lol! 
user2: Left me to assume that one of them had a great job. A Christmas vacation in Paris with all the kids except one. Marley was a good neighbor Kevin soon found out while being home alone.
user2: Kevin tried to get them to think his parents and family were at home but the burglars knew he was home alone on Christmas eve

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hi!

user2: I thought Macaulay played the character well.
user2: Great casting
user1: I also forgot that the family went to Paris.
user2: Did they?
user2: I thought they went to Florida or somewhere.
user1: Yes thats where they were when they left him.
user2: oh
user1: Yes
user2: Pretty much Kevin sets up booby traps in the home.
user1: They were already on the plane when they saw he was missing
user2: What happened to Kevin?
user2: He followed the wrong person thinking it was his dad?
user1: He was left at home
user2: Oh
user2: That's Home Alone 2
user2: Been so long ago
user2: Home Alone 1 he woke up late
user2: Got it
user1: Kevin made a lot of good booby  traps
user2: Scene 2 Kate finds Kevin missing.
user1: Kevin was sad he did not have his family on Christmas.
user2: Scene 3 is where the robbers break into the home.
user1: Scene 3 was full of action

user1: and directed by chris columbus
user2: kevin is actually the main character in the movie
user1: yes he is
user1: and is a nice movie
user2: The child artist has acted so well in such a way that he has received a lot of love and awards as well
user1: I love the trick he used to catch the theives
user1: did the movie receive a award?
user2: when this movie got released in theatres he was the centre of attraction among people and artist 
user2: May be i am not aware of it but the kid might have received awards for the movie
user1: yes I guess as much
user2: The intelligence was the main thing in the movie where the kid has used 
user2: and the presence of mind is also important one because he has used it instantly then and there to capture the thieves.
user2: what about you...what do you feel?
user1: yes he really tried
user1: until the police arrived
user2: First half of the movie is actually boring a little but the second half of the movie was really great...... 
user1: such a good movie, and well directed
user1: i feel the same way about the first half of the movie

user2: Overall the movie was good and people liked it especially the kids would have loved the movie.
user1: yes it was a nice movie, I rate it 80 %

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you today?
user1: is anybody there>
user1: ?
user2: Hi, I'm good. You should check out this movie, "Home Alone."
user1: Yes, I watched it many times when I was a kid!
user1: How about you. did you see it?
user2: Me too. It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 62%, but I liked it. 
user1: Yes, it was one of the best family movies back in the 80"s so cute and innocent!
user1: They don't make them like that today!
user1: Mccalay Kulkin was really good back then-before he went crazy!:-)
user2: It was actually made in 1990, can you believe that?
user1: I know, seems so recent, time goes by so fast...
user2: I liked Joe Pesci in it too
user1: yes, he was really good, the whole cast did a great job
user1: I like the Christmas/holiday theme
user1: also makes me very nostalgic about the good old days...everything was stable...the real America!
user2: I liked all the different booby-traps
user1: those were funny-especially when one of them fell out of the window!
user1: I like the emotional aspects too-how he got reunited with his mom and the sad elderly man...so touching
user2: Chris Columbus did a good job with directing it
user1: My kids liked it even today, although to them it seems like an ancient thing:-)!
user2: They were in such a rush because of the temporary power outage that reset the alarm clocks. That would never happen today :)
user1: No way, we are too technologically advanced! I remember VCRs were big during that time and shown in the movie and my kids asked me what  it was!
user2: lol, that's funny! Do you like comedy movies?
user1: Smart comedy-because today there is too much dumb comedy! But old classic 80's and 90's comedy is the best!
user1: Like John Candy
user1: how about you?
user2: Yeah, I do.  Home Alone had a lot of slapstick comedy, which I normally don't care too much for, but I liked it in that movie.
user1: exactly, good family movie!
user1: Heartbreak kid was a good old classic comedy
user2: The instructions said they would give us 3 movies to talk about, but so far, it's just Home Alone, so sorry to drag it out. Do you like John Heard, he plays the dad?
user1: No problem at all, we need to do this properly-yeah John Heard was pretty good, and I liked the mom, can't recall the actress's name
user1: she was in a ,lot of 80's moviesx
user2: It's Catherine O'Hara
user1: Yes, that's it!:-)
user1: the nerdy cousins with glasses were pretty funny and the bully brother as far as characters go
user2: It's funny that Kevin's family never finds out what exactly he was up to when they were gone.
user1: the house remains in perfect shape!
user1: he is an inventive kid!
user2: For sure! 
user2: I would watch it again, would you?
user1: Totally! They made a new version but it is not the same at all!
user1: It looks like we are finished here-thanks for chatting with me, have a great day!
user2: Nothing like a classic 1990 movie. Bye, thanks! :)

conversation:
user1: What a great movie that was, Macaulay Culkin had an amazing performance!
user2: I thought it was ok. But lacked in reality a lot
user1: Yeah, it was definitely unrealistic, a young kid isn't going to defend a house against a couple thiefs. 
user2: Not up to the usual John Hughes standards
user2: I suppose a kid could just shoot them though
user1: I would disagree with that though, just because it was unrealistic doesn't mean it wasn't a good movie. 
user2: As a farce it was good enough
user2: I did laugh some in spots
user1: Definitely. The actor also did a good job making you care. You root so hard for the kid to win.
user2: How about Joe Pesci, I felt sorry for him
user1: Yeah, it wasn't a good look to continually get outsmarted by an 8 year old.
user2: His buddy in crime got it even worse I think
user1: Yup, some of the traps were quite painful!
user2: Clever too
user2: The paint can on a rope was good
user1: The foreshadowing when Kevin wished his parents would disappear at the start of the movie was a clever plot device. 
user2: That was a good set up for the rest of the plot
user2: I always look for the "set up" near the beginning of a film. There usually is one.
user1: And that the power would go out, resetting the alarm clocks so they were in a hurry. Very very unrealistic but funny. 
user1: Yeah, you need something to get the plot going usually.
user2: For 1990 it was ok
user1: It was also unrealistic that when the family arrived in Paris, they couldn't get a flight back for another two days. 
user2: I guess the directors always think the audience is a bit slow witted so they got to "explain: things some.
user2: Flight delays were common then, today too.
user2: Not sure about Paris delays though, that is too popular a destination. Lots of flights from there everyday.
user1: Yeah, it wasn't that the flights were delayed, they were just booked. I figure the airlines would pull some strings in an emergency like that.
user2: I would have thought so too. But then if there was a flight there wount be a movie.
user2: lol
user1: The flight from NY to Paris is still pretty long, the burglars would just have to do everything quicker lol. 
user2: Ya  a job like that would be done in maybe 15 minutes in real life!
user1: It was a great moment with Marley saves the day by knocking out Harry and Marv with the shovel.
user1: true
user1: It's also nice that Kevin has a new appreciation for his parents when they finally return.
user2: The warm heartfelt ending, classic Hughes.
user1: Yeah, it really wrapped up the movie perfectly!
user2: Too bad they studio messed up with the sequel.
user1: I barely remember the sequels. Do you know if Hughes was behind it?
user2: Home Alone was a great film for its day. Worth another watch now and then too.
user2: Not sure if Hughes did the others
user1: Yeah, it's always on tv during Christmas time. It's a great movie to watch with the family and even young kids that weren't even close to being born when the movie came out.
user2: Once Studios own a film they exploit it every way they can for money.
user2: Kids love it cos they get to bash on adults
user1: That's true but sometimes you just want more, more enjoyable movies with similar situations. 
user2: Happy endings, they stuff we dont get much of anymore
user1: Yeah, it's funny to them that you could stop some criminals with marbles and other wacky things.
user1: I think most movies marketed to kids have happy endings, it's the adult stuff that try to veer away from that.
user2: Hughes was very good at this kind of plot
user2: His other films are similar in many ways
user1: Yeah, he was pretty good at developing any plot, he's a great director.
user2: Hughes did not direct, he had Chris Columbus to that
user1: I don't like the responses by the critics. Who would watch that movie and think "sadistic festival of adult-bashing."
user1: oh, my mistake
user2: Hughes wrote it
user1: The harder job, probably
user2: Critics are full of it in my humble opinion
user2: writing isnt a fun job
user2: parts of it are fun though, like the check. lol
user1: Yeah, I used to pay attention to sites like rottentomatoes that showed what critics overwhelmingly think about new releases but the last couple highly rated movies I watched weren't that good. 
user1: Definitely and the royalties!
user2: ya
user2: Most evey film with high ratings from a critic was bad in my opinion
user1: I wouldn't say most since even the critics can tell when a movie is entertaining but they fail us with their reviews a lot more than they should.
user2: Very true
user2: DO you think we bashed this up well enough yet?
user1: Definitely, do we just click finish?
user2: Yup
user1: thanks for the convo!
user2: hagd

user2: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and a few other actors
user1: What type of movie is it.  Adult kids etc.
user1: Is it a new movie
user2: It's from 1990
user1: Was it a holiday movie
user2: Kinda. The family is going to Paris for Christmas.
user1: The whole family goes to Paris
user2: They are supposed to, but Kevin gets left behind by mistake
user1: What happens to Kevin
user2: After a fight with his brother, he is accidentally left at home
user2: He has to fight off burglars
user1: Does he get any help
user2: No, he's home alone
user1: What do the burglars try to take
user2: I don't know
user1: What happens to the burglars
user2: Kevin sets up booby traps for them
user1: Do they get hurt
user2: There is slapstick humor
user1: What kind of booby traps does he set up
user2: Yes, they do get hurt. He sets up a lot of traps.
user1: Do they get anything broken
user2: Harry's gold tooth comes out
user1: Are there any weapons
user2: One of the burglars gets knocked out with a snow shovel. 
user1: Does Kevin try to call the family
user2: He calls the police
user1: Does the police come to the house
user2: Yes, they arrest Harry and Marv (the burglars)
user1: Then what happens to Kevin
user2: Kate makes her way home and reunites with him
user1: So he never makes it Paris
user2: No, but some of his family did
user1: Are there any other movies after Home alone
user2: You can look online. Do you like comedies?
user1: Yes I like comedies
user2: Great, you should watch this one. It got an A rating from CinemaScore
user1: I know I will.  

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1: Great! and yourself?
user2: I'm doing wonderful, thank you!
user2: So, how did you like Home Alone?
user1: I liked the first Home Alone. I always thought Macaulay Culkin made the perfect Kevin.
user1: Did you enjoy the movie?
user2: For sure, that was a movie that I'll always remember because of him and that scream. I thought it was a good christmas movie.
user2: I'm surprised the ratings are so low.
user1: The ratings surprise me, too. Must be due to the unrealistic traps he made and how the crooks never really got hurt.
user2: Haha yea, I guess so. Could you imagine what the movie would look like by todays standards?
user1: *promotes violence* ha ha ha
user2: haha. So what was your favorite part if you can remember?
user1: But it always seemed like the perfect revenge movie! His sibs and cousins were rotten.
user2: Yea very true, they all treated him like crap at first.
user2: I remember wishing something like that would happen to me though. Getting to just run around a big house like that and do whatever I wanted.
user1: when Kevin was praying over his "delicious and nutritious microwave macaroni & cheese" and when he told the cashier "an 8 yr old? Alone? In a store? I don't think so" (or something like that)
user2: I totally forgot Joe Pesci was in this movie.
user1: Joe Pesci - legend
user2: hahaha I remember that.
user2: Yea definitely.
user2: What's really funny is I think they made 2 more Home Alone movies.
user1: how do you think a parent would have reacted on a plane knowing they forgot their kid? (In 2018)?
user2: you'd think child protective services would have gotten involved before 3
user1: (nothing beats the first home alone!)
user1: Oh for real (CPS)
user2: I'm not sure. I feel like it would never happen. the kid would probably have called them on their cell phone before they even realized he was lost.
user1: Yeah I dont think people could be THAT distracted to forget a kid while they're at an airport. Especially one of the youngest kids!
user2: Although I did almost have an experience like that with a friend of mine. We all got on the plane and realized she wasn't with us right before take off. we called her and told her she was at the wrong place and she barely made it on the flight.
user1: The other thing that i always wondered...how did Kevins family become so stinking rich? Like, they paid for the uncle and their family to go to PARIS?
user2: Haha yea, losing the youngest child would be some serious negligence.
user1: Lucky friend! Can you imagine if she ended up in the wrong place? Scary!
user2: Haha yea, she has a horrible sense of direction. I know imagine how expensive that trip was
user2: Oh, well looks like we are done! Thanks for the conversation, it's been a pleasure meeting you.
user1: take care!

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user2: Just saw a terrific movie
user1: Hi!  Me as well.  It was a great movie featuring Macaulay Culkin, yes?
user2: Yes! It's called Home Alone
user2: I'm surprised it was only rated 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. It's a classic comedy!
user2: It was written by John Hughes (RIP). His movies defined the 90s.
user1: Me too!  The movie still got a got cinemaScore of an "A"
user1: Yes they did!  This was one of his best (in my opinion). 
user2: That's true. But one critic said it was "flat and unsurprising."
user2: Agreed. Also it defined Macaulay Culkin's career, of course.
user1: Yes as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.
user2: Funny that the director's name is Chris Columbus
user2: Ah yes, the would-be burglars
user1: Yes it is.  I still don't know how parents would have forgotten their child when flying to Paris for Christmas.
user2: It all starts with Kevin's fight with Buzz
user2: Then Kevin wishes his family would disappear. Be careful what you wish for!!!
user2: Kevin was only 8. Must be scary.
user1: No kidding!  The power outage doesn't help either!
user1: I can only imagine but he got what he wished for. 
user2: Right, the heavy winds caused that power outage
user2: They lived outside Chicago
user1: Yes they did.  
user2: Then later the mom tries to get back to Chicago from Paris but all the flights are booked
user1: Yes, the mom is determined to make it home to her boy
user2: I mean from Pennsylvania -- she makes it back that far!
user2: So a polka band drives her the rest of the way. Hilarious.
user1: Yup!  Pretty funny.  They were on their way to Milwaukee.
user2: The father, Peter, didn't go wit
user2: with*
user2: They're at his brother Rob's apartment
user1: No he went to his brothers place with the family
user2: Then the fun begins :-)
user2: I love when Kevin rigs the house with booby traps
user1: Kevin is one smart kid with the booby traps
user2: Best part of the movie by far, so funny
user1: Me 2!  
user1: I can only image his disappointment on xmas day
user2: Do you prefer Harry or Marv?
user1: Harry!
user1: How about you?
user1: What did you think about them finding the gold tooth in the house!  Hilarious
user1: You there?

user2: now maybe 3

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you today?
user2: good how are you>
user2: ?
user1: Doing great. How do you feel about comedy films?
user2: I like comedy once in a while. What comedy film have you watched recently?
user1: I've recently seen a classic called Home Alone. Have you heard of it?
user2: Yep. Absolutely! 
user2: what part did you watch?
user2: The home alone movie series was popular when i was growing up.
user1: Oh I saw the whole movie. I think my favorite part was the end
user1: yes it was a pretty good series.
user1: I think my favorite actor in the film was Joe Pesci. 
user1: The guy is a great comedian.
user2: Nice. Yep Kevin always had the best ideas to make life for the burglars a misery.
user2: Yep. I like him too. He has appeared in other movies since. 
user1: What would you rate the film out of 10?
user2: Parts 1 and 2, i would give 9/10
user2: What about you?
user1: I'd give it the same thing. I personally thought the critic rating were very poor.
user1: They actually gave it a 5 out of 10.
user2: Oh really? I didnt know it was critically so poor in raiting
user1: I'm not sure if the critics didn't have a sense of humor or that they just have no sense of a good movie
user2: raiting 
user2: rating* sorry
user2: True that. I personally liked the movie. 
user1: No worries, I know what you meant.
user1: In addition to the comedy, I think the lessons learned in the movie was a good touch.
user1: I'm not sure what the critics where looking for.
user2: Ah! True. Great moral at the end. 
user2: Plus, keeps me alert during the holidays about locking up the house before leaving
user2: :)
user1: Yeah, the story was a bit unbelievable but I didn't expect it to be.
user1: What parent has several kids and leaves one at home for weeks?
user2: That's true....  And how could such a big hotel miss out on figuring out that the kid was by himself
user1: Yeah, now that you mention it, it did take them a long time for them to figure out he was gone.
user1: I think out of the whole film, I dind't like the mom the most.
user2: Haha. She was okay. I didnt like the man in the hotel reception. 
user1: Yeah, he was a jerk, but he was supposed to be. 
user2: Yep. 

conversation:
user2: We are discussing the movie Home Alone, have you ever seen it?
user1: Yes, I have seen it with my children. Have you seen it?
user2: Yes I watched it when I was younger.
user1: I have seen it several times, It was a good movie.
user2: It is hard to believe that an 8 year old could come up with such elaborate booby traps.
user1: Yes he must of read a lot of books.
user2: That movie gave Macaulay Culkin his start in the film industry. 
user1: I liked the lady that lived in the woods with her birds.
user2: Yes she was a good character
user1: Oh great on Macaulay Culkin.
user2: I felt bad for him when he was sent to the attic for punishment.
user1: I don't remember that part.  Yes that is sad
user1: I'm glad the bad guys got caught though.
user2: Yes it is always good when the bad guys are caught.
user1: I believe there has been maybe 3 shows of this movie now, maybe more.
user2: Yes I think you are right. The first movie did not get good reviews from movie critics. Do you pay attention to critics reviews of movies?
user1: Yes I do pay attention to some of the critics, although I do not always agree with them.
user2:  l liked the part where the mom has to ride back to chicago in a moving van with the polka band.
user1: He did not seem very scared though, at first at being home alone
user2: I think every kid imagines having free time at home before they realize all the things they depend on their parents for.
user1: Yes that is funny and a different situation in the van.
user2: I don't think something like that would happen today.

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user2: hello?
user1: Hello
user1: one of my favorite movies of all time.
user2: It's definitely a classic
user1: I remember watching it for the first time and being jealous of Kevin. 
user2: Ha! Me too.
user1: now as a grown up all I can think of is the mortgage on that house and calling DSS on the parents LOL
user2: It's been so long since I've seen it.
user2: Right?! How do you leave your kid behind?
user1: and the fact he took care of himself, not sure if I'm impressed or petrified lol
user2: How did they forget him? I can't remember...
user2: Definitely impressive.
user1: They were all rushing to catch their flight to Paris, all 300 of them lol
user1: Kevin was banished to the attic or something the night before, he woke up after they left. Parents didnt realize he was missing until they were in the air lol
user2: Ahhh that's right. But still...how do you forget about them?
user2: They should do a modern day remake of the movie.
user1: i know right? I think subconsciously they gave up on him a long time ago lol
user2: I can't believe it was from 1990. I feel so old....
user1: ah yes, the power outage, hence why they were in a hurry 
user1: me too lol
user2: I totally don't remember the part about the mom getting a ride from Scranton
user1: yeah, this movie was before the internet was big, Twitter, FB, etc. If it came out now, itd be over in 10 minutes
user1: the ride from Scranton was with the polka band, John Candy played Gus
user2: Reading this makes me want to watch the movie again.
user1: haha awesome
user2: I love that Kevin winds up in another unoccupied house.
user2: Did you remember that? I didn't.
user2: Apparently my memory is horrible.
user2: You there?
user2: Hello?
user2: Hello?
user1: sorry yu
user1: yup
user1: you forget/remember how amazing/bad a movie was lol
user2: yeah for sure
user1: i remember the other house. 

conversation:
user1: HI
user2: Hello there
user1: Did you like the movie home alone?
user2: Home Alone? It seems that I haven't seen that movie yet.
user2: What is it about?
user1: It's basically how it sounds it's about a kid who get's left alone by mistake on Christmas. 
user1: It's a comedy movie
user2: That's interesting, I love comedy!
user2: What kind of humor does it employ? Is it mostly jokes?
user1: It's more of pranks happening. See when the boy gets left alone he was fine with it until some people tried to break into his house.
user1: So in order to get them to leave he pranked them
user2: Is this a movie you can watch with the whole family?
user1: Yes for sure 
user2: Does it include violence though?
user1: It's an older movie but it is great for laughs. There is a little violence but only things like falling down stairs, No guns are anything of that sort.
user2: That sounds good.
user2: Now that you mention that it's an old movie, do you think the movie is still enjoyable for present-day viewers?
user1: It is old movie but it what the younger kid's call "oldies but goodies." 
user2: What do you think is the perfect time of the year to watch this movie?
user1: I would say around Christmas time. Not only that but around Christmas time is when it comes on the ABC Family channel. 
user2: How long is the movie's running time?
user2: Is it viewable in 2 hours?
user1: I don't know I believe it is but you can always look it up. I do know they have a great director and cast.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hello!
user1: what you think about the movie home alone ?
user2: I love it! I dont recall theh first time I watched it, but its a great Christmas movie.
user1: yeah I loved it too
user2: I think the rotten tomatoes score is unfairly low for a 90s movie about a kid being stuck at his house, and I love John Candy.
user1: sometime reviews are not trustworthy. its personal preference. 
user2: Yea, mostly.
user2: i did love all the little booby traps
user1: :) yup
user2: And the idea that its a "sadistic festival of adult bashing" seems a little over the top since the parents and kids are jerks
user1: agree
user2: I still wonder what the dad does for work to afford the family, the house and christmas in paris with everyone.
user2: Obviously I am in the wrong business.
user1: honestly i cant answer that either
user2: It's a fun film though. My 4 year old daughter loves it, and its a great christmas movie
user1: i totally agree, usually the Christmas movies are really great movies.
user2: I dont remember who Marley was?
user1: roberts blossom he is a great actor
user1:  i should say he was. 
user2: I dont recall which character though?
user1: I cant either.
user1: movies are just for time pass not to remember, it just my attitude
user2: Me too, I have friends who are hardcore movie fanatics, but I dont care enoguh
user1: I don't either, good thing is i can watch it over and over again. 
user2: Yea, if its a decent movie. I watch Home Alone every couple years
user1: I guess i watch it every year LOL
user2: Hah! We watch a variety of Christmas movies
user2: Oh, Marley is the old guy in the park!
user1: hmm, i guess i remember now.

user1: Have you seen the movie
user2: I actually have seen the movie before! Have you?
user1: Yes, lol.  Way back in the day and every now and again, I'll watch it.
user2: Oh ya. I watch it every Christmas with the family. I am kind of surprised by the ratings according to this. 
user1: Can you imagine leaving your kid? ( I don't have one, but still)
user2: Haha ya would feel like a pretty crappy parent 
user1: I was very surprised at the ratings!  It's practically a classic Christmas movie
user2: Did you hear about the main child actor from it? 
user1: Like CPS should be involved.  then it happened a couple more times...talk about feeling unnoticed in your own family
user2: LOL ya
user2: Happens more then once
user1: Yes! Macaulay Culkin divorced his parents!  Who does that? I didn't even know it was possible
user1: I guess if you have money..
user2: Ya it seems like he wind of went off the deep end :( Happens to a lot of child actors it seems sadly 
user2: Haha with money guess you can do a lot of things 
user1: I wouldn't know about having money...lmao..
user2: Broke college life! 
user1: I just get temporary custody of it...before I have to pay bills
user2: Lol fair enough
user1: I loved that John Candy had a small part
user2: Another good actor that is gone :(
user2: He was the one that drove the parents home right? I the van
user2: The musicians or w/e
user1: I know, right?  We're getting to the point now where all the really great actors are getting old..er...(lol) and health wise, very few are doing excellent.  Same with musicians, as you've said..
user1: Honestly, If I had known when I was a kid that I was gonna still be alive at my age, I'd have taken a lot better care of myself!
user2: Never to late to start taking care of yourself!
user1: Of course not, but I wouldn't be as bad off now, if I had...lol.  Anyway, enjoyed chatting with you, I think we've done the minimum that they require..
user2: Alright well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good evening!

user2: Have you seen it?
user1: Yes I love watching that during the christmas time
user2: Somewhat old now,1990 comedy directed by chris columbus.
user2: Ya great christmas movie, since it takes place at christmas.
user2: It is always good to rewatch.
user1: I have to say the first one is the best compared to the other ones
user2: John hughes wrote and prodcued the first one, not sure abotu the tohers.
user2: about the others.
user2: He is very talented and funny.
user1: what is your favorite part
user2: Macaulay Culkin when he is relishing being left behind.
user2: I also like seeing the family dynamics, like Kevin and Buzz fighting.
user2: you still here?
user2: or rush out to go watch it,lol?
user1: yes i am
user2: I am surprised it did not get a higher score.
user1: talking about it makes me want to watch it now
user2: Rotten tomatoes only gave it 62%.
user2: You should watch it again, always enjoyable and fun.
user1: what that is a classic
user2: I know. I think people love it.
user2: That is why that score is surprising..
user1: well those critic don't know a good movie
user2: So many good actors in it too. joe pesci, daniel stern as marv, john heard..
user2: sometimes I wonder if they do ..
user1: what part don't you like
user2: Ya soem critics are so harsh, one says,' flat and unsurpring as its cute little premise suggests"
user2: I love it all.
user2: I catherine o'hara as the mother and her whole struggle to get back.
user1: come on you must not like one part of the movie
user2: is there a part you don't?
user2: I really loved this movie.
user1: I can't think either because it was a good movie
user2: well there yougo.
user1: Well I guess I didn't like two robbers bothering kevin. lol
user2: Some people obviously did not love it meta critic again in par with rotten tomatoes only gave 63%
user1: but if that happened it wouldn't  be much of a movie
user2: HAHA
user2: That had some of the best comedy.
user2: I really like joe pesci int hat role.
user2: that role
user1: Yea he and the other guy were pretty funny.
user2: I think the plot is well crafted and the whole idea of the wind and power outage and whole set up is really buyable.

conversation:

user2: When did the movie come out?
user1: The movie came out in 1990
user2: Oh okay.  Does anything else happen to Kevin besides the burgulars
user1: In the beginning Kevin was ridiculed by his siblings and cousins and was sent to his room as punishment.

user2: Aww poor Kevin
user2: Does his family get back to him?
user1: The family realized their error and try to fly back to the US
user2: Oh okay well that's a nice happy ending
user2: Does Kevin get rid of the burgulars
user1: Every flight is booked however so a traveling polka van offers them a ride in their moving van 
user2: WHo drives the polka van?
user1: I'm not sure but he definitely teaches them a lesson.
user1: Sorry, I meant to type traveling polka band
user2: Oh okay

user2:  have you watch movie home alone?
user2: how you feel ??
user2: like it?
user1: yes it is a class movie with macaulay culkin
user1: he used to be a good actor
user1: I think he does not act anymore
user1: have you seen home alon?
user1: alone*
user2: y 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) acts out the night before a family trip to Paris, his mother (Catherine O'Hara) makes him sleep in the attic.
user2: yes
user1: I am doing good thank you for asking
user2: there were very nice subject
user1: I think the movie has a lot of action
user1: and suspense
user2: the direction of the Chris Columbus awsome
user1: yes I agree
user2: yes it is the action and inteligence movie
user1: what is your favorite scene in the movie
user2: . It stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy living in Chicago who is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes being home ...
user1: yes that is my favorite scene also...
user2: when the boy make fun of thieves
user1: do you think that movie is realistic?
user2: After the McCallisters mistakenly leave for the airport without Kevin, he awakens to an empty house and assumes his wish to have no family has come true. But his excitement sours when he realizes that two con men (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) plan to rob the McCallister residence, and that he alone must protect the family home
user1: do you think a real boy could win against home invaders?
user2: no i dont think
user2: if it has the super dooper power 
user2: cant win
user2: it was the theory not practicle
user2: every one gets nervois
user2: nervous
user1: Yes I agree
user1: what punishment do you think the home invaders should receive
user1: ?
user2: even the old or matured person also got nervous
user1: yeah I would be very nervous
user1: luckily our constitution protects the second amendment
user2: i think they should have to pay penalty
user2: like 50,000 dollars penalty
user1: I would say the most punitive punishment possible would be appropriate for home invaders
user2: you agree??
user1: i think that is too soft of a punishment
user1: home invaders are scum
user2: but should be 
user1: and they must be dealt with without mercy
user2: nice talking to you
user1: they usually do not show their victims any remorse
user2: i enjoy talk to you
user2: bye.
user1: nice talking to you as well
user1: bye

conversation:
user1: Hello, How are you today?
user2: Hi Im good, how about you? the movie is home alone by the way.
user1: I'm doing good. Thanks.
user1: I don't think I've seen that one. How did you like it?
user2: I liked it a lot, it had Joe Pesci in it, and a cinema score of A
user1: Joe Pesci is a pretty good actor. I always liked his comedy style. Whats the movie about?
user2: a boy who is left alone in the house by mistake, while the parents go on vacation. while a couple of burglars try to rob the house, and he messes with them by using traps
user1: That sounds a bit entertaining. When did this movie come out? It can't be recent. 
user2: it came out in the year 1990
user1: oh wow that is an old film, it must be a classic.
user2: yes even though it got a 62% on rotten tomatoes
user1: What did you personally think of the sotry?
user2: I thought it was sort of a sadistic festival of adult bashing.
user1: Really? How so?
user2: the elaborate booby traps used in the film, seemed sadistic
user1: What was the worst one in your opinion?
user2: the first one
user1: What did the trap do?
user2: trapped the burglars
user1: that doesn't sound too bad, especially if it's a little kid making the traps.
user1: Who directed the movie? 
user2: chris columbus
user1: I can't say I've heard of that director before, you said the movie had a low rating?
user2: it had a score of 63/100 from metacritic
user1: Seems like the critics where pretty rough on the film.
user1: What score would you personally give it?
user2: about the same
user1: Oh so you don't think it was a top quality movie, just a decent watch?
user2: yes
user1: I am assuming the kid is the start of the movie. Who is the child actor?
user1: *Star
user2: macaulay culin
user1: Ah I see. I think I'll give the movie a watch if I happen across it. Seems decent enough for a watch. Thanks for the recommendation.
user2: any time
user1: Take care, have a good rest of your day.
user2: thanks you too

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: hello
user2: What is the name of the movie you read about?
user1: Home Alone and yours?
user2: I wasn't given a movie to read about.
user2: I'm supposed to ask about your movie and decide if it is worth watching.
user2: So on that note, what would you say makes Home Alone 2 worth watching based on what you read?
user1: This movie has average rating of 5.5/10
user1: Do you usually watch movies with good/bad rating?
user2: It sounds totally average then.
user2: I've been surprised at some "poorly rated" movies being good, but I've also found some with positive reviews that were trash.
user2: How much stock do you put into ratings?
user1: I put some time into ratings
user2: Would you personally watch Home Alone 2--even though it's only got a 5.5/10 rating?
user1: I would say the same actors is what makes Home Alone 2 worth watching
user1: I would watch it because I like the first one. 
user1: Have you ever watched any of them?
user2: Yeah, and the first one wasn't bad for a slapstick comedy film--so I imagine more of the same wouldn't be too bad?
user2: Does it say any of the negatives of the film--why the lower rating?
user1: It says that the film's first half is "flat and unsupring as its cute little premise suggests."
user1: The second half is praised for its slapstick humor
user2: Wow that first part sounds like a pretty generic statement--sounds like a movie critic though. LOL
user2: But yeah, definitely have to be in the mood for that kind of cheesy humor
user1: Do you normally watch Comedy 
user2: Yeah, that's one of my favorite genres, you?
user1: Yes I do
user1: what other genres do you like
user2: I also like sci-fi and thrillers
user2: What about you?
user1: I like Documentaries and thrillers
user2: Yeah definitely like documentaries as well
user2: Have a favorite movie?
user1: good fellas you?
user2: Not sure at the moment. Fight club was for a while, but burned myself out after watching it too many times. Pulp fiction also ranks up there.

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user2: Good morning
user1: So, have you seen this movie before?
user2: Yes, I have, many times, it is a good one.
user1: It is definitely a classic movie! I can't believe this movie came out in 1990.
user1: Do you know what the Rotten Tomatoes rating was for it?
user2: Yes, a classic, I'd agree. It is an oldie. No, I am a bit surprised. I like the humor in this movie.
user1: Yeah it surprisingly got lower ratings. 
user2: Macaulay is a great actor in this movie, for being so young. I think he does a great job. The boobie traps are hilarious.
user1: I see that it received a Metacritic Score of 63/100 as well.
user1: Oh definitely! I feel like this was Macaulay Culkins best work!
user2: The Cinema score is high however.
user1: Yeah it is pretty high.
user1: I didn't know that this film was directed by Chris Columbus.
user2: I haven't heard of him, is he famous?
user1: I feel like I have heard his name somewhere, but I cannot place what movie it was.
user1: I see that Kevin was supposed to be 8 years old in the film! I can't believe all the traps that were set up by a 8 year old.
user2: Joe Pesci was hilarious in this movie, as well as Daniel Stem. I think Daniel was my favorite.
user1: Oh yeah, they were great! I think my favorite has to be Peter.
user2: I think the beginning of the movie was still interesting, not "flat".
user1: I don't think it was flat at all.
user1: But then again, it has been so many years since I have seen this film!
user1: I can't imagine landing in another country and then realizing that my child was home.
user1: Do you remember when Kate realized he was missing?
user2: Yes, I have seen it within the last 5 years maybe and I still enjoy it. It is fun to see how you always grab something new from each time you watch it. Yes, poor Kate, I would die. I have three kids.
user1: Hahahaha! I'm sure you can't even imagine being in Kate's position. And I hope you never do experience that!
user2: I still wonder if an 8-year-old would really do this good on his own. I was always impressed by how well he did and wondered how it would be in real life.
user1: Yeah I wonder that too! I feel like he could have easily handled himself, there were just lots of inconveniences due to the other two.
user1: Was it the first film when he was eating the ice cream in a hotel?
user2: I can't remember that part of him eating ice cream...
user2: love the review regarding the "adult-bashing" that is hilarious wording
user1: Oh yeah I just saw that....sadistic festival. Hahaha!
user1: I love the persistence of Harry and Marv, you would think after that many "falls" that they would give up.
user2: No kidding, how humiliating!
user1: I can't imagine how tired you would be flying to Paris and then flying all the way home.
user2: Oh my goodness and so sad to leave that trip behind for this reason. I would be angry too.
user1: And poor Kevin too! I can't imagine how sad I would feel being left behind.
user1: But then again....maybe I would be excited being a kid alone.
user2: Yes, I am not sure which feeling would win in my case. Definitely a mix of both.
user1: Did his parents find out about Marv and Harry?
user2: Yes, that is something I can't remember. Do they even mention that?
user1: I don't know if they do, I see in the key scenes that Kevin keeps silent about the interaction with them. 
user1: But I don't remember in the end.
user1: I think we are just about finished?
user2: I think he stays silent, as you mentioned. Then the movie comes to an end, as I remember, so you don't know what happens.
user2: Yes, I think we have discussed just about everything.
user1: Alright! Have a good day!
user2: You too!

user2: Hello
user1: hello
user2: Home Alone is a film directed by Chris Columbus.
user2: It stars Macaulay Culkin and Joe Pesci and David Stern.
user2: John heard and Roberts Blossom are also in it.
user1: It is a 1990 American comedy film  written and produced by John Hughs
user1: the film's first half is "flat and unsurprising"
user1: the second half is praised for its slapstick humor

conversation:
user2: Home Alone: There's a classic!
user2: I loved it. What did you think?
user1: I love this movie too!
user2: The booby-traps are great. 
user1: I thought John Hughes directed it though, and its always surprising to realize that Chris Columbus directed it. He directed a few of the Home Alone movies.
user1: I mean the "Harry Potter" Movies
user2: Ah, OK. 
user2: Cute kid with powers either way. :)
user1: Ha absolutely!
user1: I can't believe its been 28 years since it came out.
user2: That's kind of sobering. 
user2: Ah, a new paragraph. The first part of the movie, with the family tensions, always made me kind of edgy.
user2: I didn't like the way the family treated Kevin.
user1: Ya it felt like he was singled out a little too much. If I saw one of my brothers treating my son like that, the way the uncle speaks to him, I would be so angry!
user1: Exactly
user1: As a kid though I think we respond to intense versions of what we're experiencing, so if they only "lightly" bullied him we might not have recognized it.
user2: Right? The whole joy in being left behind is so sad.
user2: Tjat
user2: That's a good point.
user1: I wish all of my contraptions worked as well as Kevin's did, if only I had a team of visual effects professionals on hand!
user2: New paragraph. The polka band was a lot of fun!
user1: OH man I loved Gus Polinski!
user2: Mom's determination to get back no matter what it takes ... doesn't quite make up for the way Kevin was treated. though.
user1: Oh for sure. It still is such a touching moment though when Kevin walks into the hall and sees her.
user1: When they lock eyes and embrace, its such a warm moment.
user2: Made me tear up. But we're not quite there yet.
user2: Ah, we are now!
user2: Marley's pretty cool, too. The old guy who rescues him.
user1: Ha when Buzz walks into the room is the best
user2: :)
user1: Oh man, Marly was done so well he scared the crap out of me when I was younger, even though after multiple viewings I knew he was a good guy.
user1: When they talk about his son's relationship in the church, its so touching.
user2: The bit with him reuniting with his family across the street made me tear up, too.
user2: The paragraphs here don't give a lot of information about the booby-traps.
user2: I'm surprised the Rotten Tomatoes rating is only 62%
user1: Oh ya that scene was wonderful. All the thick snow is great too, always makes me want some hot chocolate. 
user1: Ya thats because adult critics think its for adults 
user1: when Its for kids
user2: I can see that. Yeah.
user1: Well thanks for talking about Home Alone!
user2: My pleasure! Thank you!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello!
user1: Have you seen the movie Home Alone?
user2: I have before, it is a good movie. I am surprised that it scored as low as it did on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic
user2: It seems like the adults that watched the film did not find it that funny since the document says that critical responses said that it was a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing"
user1: hwllo
user2: It seems like a movie that seems funny enough though. It seems a little critical though I think
user1: It did score somewhat low
user1: But the actos are great
user1: Joe Pesci
user2: That surprised me that it scored low
user1: and Macaulay Culkin
user2: Do you think that Culkin does a good job acting as Kevin dealing with his cousins and siblings?
user1: Yes he does an amazing job!
user1: I can't believe it came out so long ago- almost 20 years!
user1: He's good in recent movies too
user1: although I don't remember the names.
user2: It doesn't feel like it's been 20 years since this movie has come out haha. I guess I just feel old. 
user1: I know- me too. I watched that movie as a child
user2: I wonder if Columbus would change anything about the movie if he had the chance today?
user1: Maybe, but also it's such a notable movie , i feel like the viewer wouldn't want any changes
user1: I didn't realize they left to spend christmas in Paris
user1: I thought it was NYC the family travelled to
user2: Between that scene and the next scene, I feel really bad for the family. Talk about bad luck, not a fun way to spend your Christmas
user1: oh not fun at all! 
user1: It's so funny
user2: I find it hilarious because that is about as good as my luck is
user1: the part that scared me when I was little were when the two burglers got into the home
user1: but it ended up being a comedy 
user1: didn't realiize the genre was comedy when I first watched
user2: I find it funny that they "mistakingly left him at home". I guess with bigger families, it is hard to keep track of all of your kids at once!
user2: I can relate to Harry and Marv here. I am clumsy and seem to get injured rather...easy per se 
user1: Hahaha me too! I don't think I would be smart enough to set up all the traps though!
user2: I don't think I would either. I would set up simple ones then just be waiting with like a gun or something. Kevin goes out and beyond what any normal person would do o_0
user1: Oh absolutely!
user1: It's super weird
user1: He was SUCH A smart child
user2: But super funny too
user1: Where did they live?
user1: Chicago?
user2: I believe that's what the document said. If I remember correctly, Chicago is where they live. And they can't get back home because of the cancelations and delays
user1: oh damn
user1: I hear Chicago is so busy during the holidays
user1: I didn't realize the power went out because winds knocked them out too
user1: I really forgot a lot of details from the movie!
user1: It was so long ago I watched
user2: I've never been there during aholiday, but the movie made it seem super busy
user1: OH yeah! No surprise it took them so long to get home
user1: Lol funny kevin wished his parents would disappear 
user1: and then they did
user2: At least Kevin wasn't bored during the holiday
user1: lmaoo I would have been so sad home alone
user1: I hear the critical responses are so mean
user2: I feel for Kevin still not having his family on Christmas
user2: I don't understand why though
user1: some of them are nice and promote the movie, but others dont justify how great it is
user1: Yeah me neither
user2: Well, it was fun discussing childhood memories of movies with you!
user1: Same here, see you next time!

conversation:
user2: Hello there
user1: Hi! Soo, did you like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone?
user2: Yea home alone is one of my favorite comedies
user2: Can't believe it was released in 1990
user1: Yeah, maybe that's why it has such low ratings?
user1: It's only 62% on Rotten Tomatoes...
user2: You think the new generation doesn't appreciate it
user2: although it did receive an A on Cinemascore
user1: I cannot imagine who wouldn't like, as one reviewer said, "sadistic festival of adult-bashing"
user1: That sounds, and is, so fun
user2: Yep, especially when the supporting actors are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. It's a comedy overdose
user1: Also I think everyone has such siblings and cousins like Kevin has, who always ridicule him. Lots of people can relate to him.
user2: Haha, yeah i remember that scene in the beginning when he's fighting with his brother Buzz, he gets punished and sent to his room
user1: But how much everyone had to rush to leave a son behind... This is insane
user2: Yea, i think it happened because of a malfunction in the alarm clock, what are the odds happening on the night of the flight
user1: I'm glad we have smartphones now, less chance of this kind of happening like oversleeping!
user2: Yeah, the Director Chris Columbus did an excellent job in this movie, do you know if it won any awards?
user1: Oh no, sorry, I don't know. but I would be amazed if it didn't win any.
user2: I might look it up later, i'm remembering the scene when the mom realizes Kevin is missing while sitting on the plane
user1: Yeah, that scene was so funny and so scary at the same time. The feeling of leaving your kid thousands kilometers away...
user2: yea and what's funnier is when she was stuck with that Polka band to go back and find him
user1: Well, moms will do anything to get back with her son, even travel with the polka band, lol!
user2: I think she was forced to because all flights were booked
user1: But it was fun times for Kevin at least! Preparing all of those booby traps looked so interesting
user2: Yea, what i didn't understand is how those thieves remained active after all those injuries hahaha
user1: This is a comedy genre after all, hahe.
user1: Oh how stupid they were actually. Leaving all of the burgled houses with the tap on was so unsmart for them.
user2: Why was it, to flood them?
user1: Yup, like what's the point of that...
user2: True, just like some critics were cynical that an 8 year old boy is able to devise all these booby traps, i think the movie did intentionally have some weird plot twists like that
user2: It was nice chatting to you, bye

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: What movie are we discussing?
user1: Hi!
user1: The movie is Home Alone.  Have you seen it?

user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 62%, I am shocked at that.
user2: Oh for real??
user2: I wonder what that was based on

user2: It seems like it's actually a good story though
user2: and mccauley caulkin is talented
user1: Yes, it really is. 
user2: you know the part where he's watchiing the scary old gangster movie?
user1: Yes, he seems like one of those odd people that are very creative.
user1: Yes!
user2: I just found out that's not a real movie
user2: lol
user2: they just made that clip specifically for home alone
user1: It's not?  
user2: Nope
user2: funny trivia thing
user1: That's crazy!  But John Hughes was a genius filmmaker so I can see him doing that.
user2: For sure
user2: I forgot that that was john hughes too
user2: he's the breakfast club one right?
user2: pretty in pink?
user1: Yes, he did all of those.
user2: sixteen candles
user1: Cult classics!
user2: #nostalgia
user1: Definitely!
user2: Home Alone 2 is cute too
user1: It was a winning combination of talent from the cast and crew!
user2: Always lol

user2: I thought it was good too!
user1: She is a great actress, all the 80s comedies are great.
user2: Donald Trump has a cameo in Home ALone 2 too
user2: lol
user2: So weird
user1: I saw that on twitter last Christmas.  Who would have thought, right
user2: The height of DJT's film career LOL

user2: hard to believe that was allmost 30 years ago....did he have a pet with him?
user1: I don't think so

user1: Sorry Kevin!
user2: I can't really remember most of it... but think there were storms

user1: Home alone is the classic holiday film! 
user1: Ive seen it a thousand times
user2: It is! I love that movie
user2: Ive seen a thousand times as well, mostly with family
user2: What do you like the most about the movie
user1: Neat, favorite is Joe Pesci, he's the man in that film haha
user2: Yeah, he is pretty funny
user2: I really like the role of Kevin
user2: he just cracks me up
user1: Yeah classic character. Rotten tomatoes clearly graded it wrong
user2: Yeah I agree
user2: I  think the CinemaScore rating is more accurate
user1: Your right
user2: So what do you think about the director of the film
user1: I like his name
user1: Christopher Colombus
user2: Original huh lol
user2: reminds me of someone else famous 
user1: Right lol. I'm a 90's baby, do you think kids today enjoy this film?
user2: and what about the critic responses, what did you thought about them?
user2: I think they might
user2: if they give a chance for sure
user2: maybe they wont watch it because of the old visual effects
user2: but the movie is golden
user1: Yeah, the critiques were harsh
user2: Yeah, they are pretty harsh, I dont get why though
user1: They probably just hated Mcully lol
user2: I think they should try and rob Kevin to see what happens next lol
user1: Haha right.
user2: So who else did you like?
user1: I like how the guy that played the dad eventually landed other huge roles.
user2: what about Marv?
user1: Marvs classic  he was my favorite as a kid

user2: I like Marv as well, 
user2: he is a great character
user1: Thanks

conversation:
user1: What do you think of Macaulay Culkin's performance as Kevin in Home Alone?
user2: I love it.... it has always been one of my favorite movies. 
user2: Most find it super predictable. What do you think of it? 
user1: I found it to be hilarious, that it kept on surprising me. 
user1: Do you think that the amount of booby traps that Kevin set was repetitive as a main plot point to the movie?
user2: I think the traps are kind of repetitive, but they work for the film. 
user1: I agree. I don't think that it deserved the low score it got from Metacritic. I think it did well for the type of movie it was.

conversation:
user2: Hi, what movie should we talk about?
user1: We're talking about Home Alone.\
user2: I love that movie, that kid is hilarious.
user1: It has an average score of only 5.5/10. I think that's crazy, I've always loved that movie.
user2: me too.  it is a fun christmas movie.  critics can be so mean.
user1: Joe Pesci and Daniel  Stern were hilarious in it, and Macaulay Culkin.
user2: Joe Pesci always makes a movie fun to watch.  Whatever happened to Macaulay Culkin?
user1: A critic response was "Flat and unsuprising." That movie is full of suprises.
user1: I'm not sure after the Home Alone series.
user1: The director for the movie was Chris Columbus, and it came out in 1990.
user2: Seriously?  that's crazy.  Now I feel old.  
user2: I think we should rent Home Alone and watch it again.  even if there's no surprises left.
user1: I thought it was a crazy concept of a movie, but loved it.
user2: Everyone should love a good "Kid outsmarts the baddies" movie.  
user1: Yes, they should.
user1: What was your favorite booby trap that Kevin did to the burglars?
user2: Definitely the iron in the face.  hahaha.  laugh just thinking about it.
user1: That's a good one. lol
user2: David Stern and Joe Pesci make the best faces.
user2: how about yourself?
user2: oooo, also liked the tarantula face he made.  awesome.
user1: When the boy made the floor slippery, and they flew all over the place.
user2: hee hee hee.  
user2: the second and third movies weren't as good, but still enjoyed watching them.
user2: what did you think of those?
user1: The mom Kate, gets home by a traveling polka band. lol
user1: I still liked them, the first is my favorite, though.
user2: and gets home at the same time as the rest of the family.  HA!
user2: i don't know how anyone can raise that many kids.
user2: i guess it was a couple families not just one.  but still, too many people in one house!
user1: Well, wasn't it a few family members and their kids, not all their kids?
user1: It is a lot of people. lol 
user2: do you watch Home Alone every christmas?  we only watch it if it's showing on tv
user1: I forgot about the character Marley, the hobo that helps Kevin. They just added it in on the key scenes.
user1: I haven't in a while, I probably will soon, though.
user2: its fun to watch with kids who have never seen it before.  hard to find those though.
user2: i think everyone has watched it.
user2: they are serious about 15-20 min.  lol, but this is fun!
user1: Yeah, it's still a great movie.
user1: Thanks for chatting. :)
user2: marley made me jump when he showed up at the end to help kevin
user1: Yup, and for some reason, I didn't remember Marley at first, I guess I do need to watch it. lol
user2: yup he's a small character, but still important to the plot.
user2: oh no!  you've left the chat.  now what do i do?

conversation:
user1: Hello, how is it going?
user2: all good. Have you watched the movie home alone?
user1: I actually have never seen that one.  I know it's supposed to be like a classic or something
user2: Yes, it is about a boy who fantasizes about being alone at home without any adults, and that actually happens.
user1: Sounds interesting.  Who is in it?
user2: The protagonist is Macaulay Culkin. He goes by Kevin in the movie.
user1: I remember him. 
user2: It has Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern too.
user1: Is it a serious movie?
user2: Nope. It is a comedy. 
user1: That's pretty cool.  I might like to watch a comedy with Jo Pesci.
user1: When did it come out, do you know?
user2: Yes, he is interesting! but it is surprising that the movie is not rated that well. 
user2: it came out in 1990
user1: I typically can ignore reviews for a fun movie.  If this fits that bill I may go ahead and watch!
user2: Sure! The first half is cute, and the second half pulls you into adventure! you may want to watch it 
user1: I think I will!
user1: Thank you for the reccomendation.
user2: On a creative side, it gives you ideas about creating booby-traps for fun too.
user1: Hmm that sounds pretty interesting.  I am guessing there is a cool trap in the movie at some point?
user2: Yes... Kevin is accidentally left behind in his house and his mom realizes that in mid-flight.
user1: Is he left alone for a long time?
user2: Yes, His mom tries to get back to him, but the flights are all booked. She has to travel with polka band who offer her a ride to Chicago.
user1: Sounds like a very fun movie.  I am hoping to find it on Netflix or some other streaming service.  I am looking forward to watching it.
user2: Sure. Watch out for Harry and Marv. They break in when Kevin is by himself at the home, That is when he makes a series of booby traps to protect himself. Have fun and enjoy the movie.
user1: Haha, awesome.  Will do.  Thank you again!
user2: No problem. On a different note, this happens during Christmas, and it has a happy ending.
user2: I'm sure you will enjoy Kevin and his mom reconcile 
user1: Yea, it sounds like it.  I always like reunions too.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi
user1: which movie are we talking about?
user2: Looks like we’re talking about home alone
user1: which part?
user2:  Looks like we’re talking about home alone one the one that came out in 1990 with McAuley Culkin‘s 
user1: The one in which he goes to New York or the one he was left home alone?
user2:  Looks like it has a rotten tomatoes number 62 
user2:  Yes that’s exactly right 
user2:  He was eight years old in this movie 
user1: How many times have you watched this movie?
user1: I have probably seen it at least 4 times
user2:  Only remember watching it when I was a kid I’m not sure how many times. I do know I love Joe Pesci because of it really fantastic and funny actor 
user1: It often airs on TV during the holidays, so I end up watching it
user1: I watched it as a kid too
user2:  Oh that makes sense. I forgot that they were going to go to Paris as their trip I just thought they were going to like California or something I had forgotten more than I remembered about the movie 
user1: it's always funny and fun to watch
user1: in this movie, they family forgets to take him
user2:  It is I like McAuley Culkin younger work  he did really funny and good job for somebody that young 
user1: the mom realizes after they have boarded the plane
user2:  Yeah once I get to Paris they realize they forgot them 
user1: yes, his acting was really good
user2: Wel midflight because I can’t really do anything to the land
user2:  I think weather prevented them from getting back as quickly as possible to him
user1: they have to wait until they land and then she goes crazy over trying to get a flight back
user2:  my favorite part or all the booby traps set
user2:  As a kid I wanted to be able to do all of them especially the one on the stairs 
user1: Yes, the clever ways he tries to trap the thieves
user1: would you watch it again?
user2:  Yeah I think I would or at least watch with my kids to see it through their eyes for the first time 
user2:  It teaches a lot about perseverance in the family so would be kind interesting to see their take
user1: it's also a lot of holiday spirit and family love
user2:  Really does I was nice talking to you have a good day 

conversation:
user2: hey buddy
user1: Hello!
user2: so tell me
user1: Well this movie is a 90s film called Home Alone
user2: Okay
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: made in 199??
user1: 1990 exactly
user2: okay
user2: never seen it completely
user1: by that, do you mean you have seen bits and pieces?
user2: so what is it about?
user1: Well, its a comedy and it stars Macaulay Culkin.
user2: yeah you are absolutely right but I dont remember the characters though
user1: Hes was an adorable child actor during the 90s 
user2: any other notable character
user2: ??
user2: and what kind of ratings or reviews did it get 
user1: So the gist of the movie is that Macaulay Culkin know as kevin is the youngest in the family who is mistakenly left behind when the family flies to Paris for their summer vacation
user2: You mean the family left him behind and flew to paris?
user1: other notable characters include Joe Pesci as Harry and Daniel Stem as Marv
user2: That must be scary for Kevin
user2: are you still there?
user1: Yes but he begins to love being at home, the freedom and the ability to get into mischief. He encounters two lack luster burglars who struggle with him throughout the movie as he turns his house into trap after trap
user2: So he was catching fun alone with the burglars?
user1: The night before the family departs for vacation, there are heavy winds that cause damage to power lines and the power outage resets the alarm clocks
user1: so the next morning they are in an absolute panic getting out the house and actually forget kevin
user1: The mom doesnt discover that she is one kid short until they are actually mid flight to paris.
user2: Oh I see, they hurried to the airport after their alarm clocks got reset and forgot the little man 
user2: but the parents didn't try dude! how could you forget the child
user2: *they
user1: This kid is super crafty. Instead of calling the police, he rigs the house with numerous booby traps to hurt these burglars
user1: Well they tried hard to get back to him but with the christmas rush all the flights were completely booked up
user2: Maybe the parents deliberately left him behind because of his mischeif
user2: Ok I get the gist now,
user2: How did the movie rate?
user2: and who wrote the story
user1: Rotten Tomatoes had it at 62% and its Metacritic score was 63/100
user2: maybe you could tell me the name of the director too
user2: that is a fair score 
user1: Produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus
user1: Good talking with you
user2: Alright and would you sincerely recommend me to see this movie 
user2: you know I love action and thrillers

conversation:
user1: hello

user2: so Am i suppose to ask questions about them movie?
user1: Did you see this crazy but good movie?
user2: Ummm I don't know....What was it about?
user1: I think we are suppose to talk about it. It was about when the family went on vacation and left the little boy at home by himself, and he protected the home from two robbers
user2: Who was in it?
user2: Ohhhh ok 
user2: I remember the little boy 
user1: I could see this movie all over again
user2: and the two robbers
user2: Me too!
user2: I remember watching it when I was a little kid
user1: They had three movies about it, I did see two of them.
user2: I think I only saw the first one
user1: I like how the little boy protected the home from the two robbers
user2: It was around christmas time too
user2: I agree!
user1: Yes, they always play them around Christmas
user2: The little kid was kind of a trouble maker I liked that....
user1: In the other movie, he wasn't left at home. somehow he got on the wrong plane and ended up in New York
user2: The kid was in a bunch of other movies in the 90s too
user2: Ohhhh I thought he was in all of them
user1: Yes he was, he should have stayed little because he could not handle adulthood too good
user1: I think he was in the first two, another little kid played in home alone 3
user2: Yeah I need to watch the movie again
user2: I definitely know what movie it is 
user1: I don
user2: Can you finish the conversation? My end won't let me
user1: I don't know how long this conversation is suppose the last, I can't end it either.

user1: I think I am the only that can see the writing about the movie, 
user2: I don't know either

conversation:

user1: Hi, happy Friday, hope going well.
user2: Hi, I'm going to talk to you about this movieHome Alone

user2: this is a comedy movie
user1: yes like a family friendly one for sure.
user2: It is an extremely funny, accepted and good movie.
user1: yes, I enjoy the plot line, a big family leaving for a trip and don't notice someone missing.
user2: is a children's film of the year 1990 that was directed by Chris Columbus.
user2: if so, this is how the plot is based.
user1: it must be like one of very few hits with Macaulay Culkin in i! 
user2: if it was starring Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, Roberts Blossom, John Heard and John Candy in the lead roles.
user2: It was one of his best known successes
user1: Yeah i think all the other actors didn't go on to star in much either after this, other than home alone 2! :)
user2: the 8-year-old boy who lives with his family in Chicago. The film begins with a dinner on the eve of a trip that was planned to celebrate Christmas in Osorno.
user1: cute though, could you imagine leaving a kid home alone accidentally? lol 
user2: Yes, it seems to be like that. and this actor has been the best known since then.
user2: the family had many more children
user1: yeah I think they had extended family over as they were going on this trip so i guess also with them running late and behind itd be easy to not notice one missing
user1: I mean I see when they notice him missing they try to get a flight back but in reality you would call a friend or neighbor and tell them what happened
user1: guess have to bend the rules of reality when watching it a bit
user2: Yes, this is what happened while the family was focused on the preparations for the trip and dinner
user2: His movements are monitored by the delinquent Harry (Joe Pesci), who had managed to enter the house with a police disguise.
user1: oh yes i love Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in this!
user1: they play good villians
user2: If these are very villains .. During dinner, Kevin must endure the taunts of his older brother Buzz, the mistreatment of his abhorrent Uncle Frank, and a punishment from his mother Kate to cause a disaster at dinner.
user1: yea his brother Buzz taunts him a lot, typical older brother

conversation:
user1: good morning
user2: good morning to you
user2: this is new to me so I will try to do my best
user1: me also lol we can tak baby steps 
user2: ^^ So the film is pretty much a classic: Home Alone
user1: great movie is it in the summer winter ?
user2: It takes place during Christmas, do you have an affinity for those kinds of Christmas films?
user1: I like Christmas films brings the family together 
user1: Snow setting in the mountains or suburban area?
user2: That's right. Now, the film has some pretty great folks associated with it, you have Chris Columbus famous for numerous films, but you also have John Hughes writing, Joe Pesci in the cast, it's supposed to be funny. In the suburbs, definitely
user1: ok great. love joe pesci. what style of home ubdate or modern. I like the older passed down house look gives the story some depth 
user2: The first scene sounds like a doozy, have you ever had trouble with older siblings?
user1: lol yes I did they made for great stories later on in life
user2: You should love the opening then, at the very least, crazy things happen from the get go. The film surprisingly, didn't have that good of a critical reception at the time it was released. Do you usually listen to critics?
user1: I used to watch sisbrg an ebert reviews. but  didn't follow there advise 
user2: Home Alone actually has a 62 % on Rotten Tomatoes, and an average rating of 5.5/10, ridiculous in my opinion, what do you think?
user1: yes the movie is an all time brigde between ages me an mother still watch it with the kids. my wife bought the dvd set an vhs set just to keep an pass it along. wow  American CLASSIC. I LOVE THE MOVIE 
user2: So do I ;-) All time classic. Seeing the description of the second scene, I was wondering if you were ever in a situation where you were stranded at an airport, or somehow someone who was supposed to be here was left behind?
user1: scene setting is great airports have great lighting an back grounds. why yes i was stranded at an airport 
user2: For how long were you stranded? 
user1: 12 hours at Regan national i was 13 
user2: Wow ! Well, Kevin is just a boy, 8 actually in the film, alone in his house, was it scary? Did it make you empathize deeper with Kevin as a result?
user1: ok 8 is a frightening time growing up especially in a house that have sounds that make the imagination go wild, yes i did empathize with him the feeling of being left carries along way.
user2: exactly. How did you like seeing Kevin actually rigging the house with all those booby traps, did it feel believable to you? Was it too much? Some critics seemed to think so
user1: None of the critics have imagination. Telsa had imagination Albert Einstein Had imagination. people whom criticize tend to think only logically. So yes I believe the rigging could work, its never to much when a child is using his imagination an building skills; guess the first flight test was a fluke if they had to be there the critics of this error of course.
user2: It's been criticized by a few as being implausible and therefore hard to care about Kevin, I disagree completely. Did it feel sadistic though to you? In the way it was done?
user1: Wow the movie is based on being left an defending the home an protecting one self with minimal impact but a lot of laughs. Some people forget the 3 stooges, a lot of there scenes where real an well thought out. The riggings work if your a boy scout an prankster. It wasn't sadistic it was compassion an hilarious to see people still getting feathered  
user2: I completely agree. Which performance was your favorite in the film?
user1: yes awesome
user1: my favorite was the scene with the paint bucket an the stairs classic

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: hey
user1: have you seen home alone?
user2: Its very good have you?
user1: Yeah, i hated it
user2: Alot of the actors went on to play in many movies afterwards
user2: Never met someone who hated home alone
user1: I felt it was completely illogical 
user2: I thought how he played all the tricks was clever...thought being left home alone at that age would be scary
user2: Tipical 90s movie haha
user1: who would be dumb enough to leave their kid behind? And not call the cops because he's alone/

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Which movie have u recieved?
user2: Home Alone. Have you seen it? 
user1: I dont see the format on my scree
user1: yes i have seen it 
user1: They have so many version 
user2: I don't think you are getting the info.. Just me. 
user1: Exactly
user2: This is the one from 1990. It was so cute. Don't you think? 
user1: I guess this this about 90s 
user1: yes super cute
user2: Yes, with McCauley Culkin. 
user1: reminds me of old days...when childhood is fun
user2: I haven't seen it in years and may have to get it out again. 
user2: IKR! And it's such a good winter movie too. 
user1: yes agree
user1: Whats your favorite part
user2: All of the tricks that he played on the robbers, Joe Pesci and that other guy...
user1: Although i m not sure if i remember all
user1: Yes tricks were awesome
user2: Remember, he made booby traps - kind of like Rube Goldberg experiments? 
user1: haha:)
user2: Can you imagine forgetting a kid while you go to Paris?? 
user2: I grew up in a big family but I can't imagine that.
user1: I guess no..but who knows kids will be kids
user2: So apparently he had a fight with his big brother and went to the attic  as a punishment. 
user2: The whole family oversleeps and that's how he gets forgotten. 
user2: THAT part could have happened in our family. haha
user1: Ohh god 
user1: i completely forgot that
user1: I think i should watch it again
user2: I know - I'm thinking I should too. 
user1: It was nice chatting 
user2: Nice chatting to you too. 
user1: Bye bye
user2: bye

conversation:
user1: You should see "Home Alone."
user2: I like the second half, but it starts pretty slow
user2: Do you think the rating is fair?
user1: I agree. The first have is flat and unsurprising as it its cute little premise suggests.
user1: Yes. John Hughes is great, but I can see how adults would get tired of the booby-traps and adult bashing.
user2: It's pretty unrealistic, considering how much the booby traps would cost to construct
user1: The slapstick humor can get old so the emotional parts help hold the movie together.
user2: I agree, the ending especially 
user1: The conversation between Kevin and Marley?
user2: That too
user2: What did you think of the events leading up to Kevin being left behind?
user1: It made you feel bad for Kevin as his siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles, and even his parents seemed to gain up on him. Getting sent to the attic is pretty harsh.
user2: I agree, but I think that Kevin "wishing that his family would disappear" in a movie about him being left alone was a little predictable
user1: I don't see how an eight year old would believe that he made his family disappear because of the wish.
user2: That's not what I mean. I mean that it's a little flat and maybe even boring writing
user1: I see. The confusion and rush to the airport was pretty unbelievable but well done in the movie. So you think maybe it could happen?
user2: Maybe, yeah. I think that Kate's journey to get back to Chicago were also a little... convenient
user1: A convenient plot device. Certainly not the greatest thing to be in a van with a traveling polka band from Scranton to Chicago.
user2: Ha, that's true. I don't think there was any deeper meaning to that sub-plot though, and that's where the issue lies with the first half of the movie
user1: I doubt absolutely no flights would be available nowadays. 
user1: And no rental cars either?
user2: Of course not. The plot has contrivances to set up Kevin being left home, alone
user1: The movie was ready to take a really dark turn when Harry and Marv finally captured Kevin. 
user2: It's a nice relief when Marley hits them with his shovel
user1: The police were pretty useless. They got the criminals and their crime spree left in their lap.
user2: They did work out that Harry and Marv were the culprits behind all those other robberies though
user1: I did find it funny that the rest of family showed up just after his mom does. All that work to get home quick for nothing!
user2: it goes to show that that side plot didn't add all that much to the movie.
user1: I'd like to think that Kevin did explain what happened to him. Dad found the gold tooth and Buzz's room was destroyed. Explain that Kevin!
user2: I like that the ending doesn't show us everything, and that we can imagine that the family kept on living afterwards
user1: We needed to see Gus Polinski.

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hello
user2: I LOVE home alone
user2: do you?
user1: me too.
user2: it's classic and i will never get tired of watching it
user1: yes it funny
user2: i watch it every year around christmas time
user1: wow  me too.
user2: can't believe it came out in 1990! 
user1: yes seen year is wrong.
user2: look at the ratings!! I can't believe how low the ratings are!!
user2: rotten tomatoes only 62%
user1: home alone is 63?
user2: I think this movie deserves better ratings! like much better ratings
user2: what do you think about the cast?
user1: i like the cast
user2: I love Macaulay Culkin
user2: he did great in those movies
user1: joe pesci is good
user2: yes, he is 
user2: and look at the critic responses
user2: are  they nuts? I strongly disagree with them
user1: yes
user2: they say this movie is a "sadistic festival of adult bashing"
user1: they made 2
user1: or 3?
user2: i think there are 3 home alone movies
user1: ok
user1: all is good
user2: but i only like the first 2 because Macaulay Culkin plays in those first 2 movies
user1: yes me too.
user2: Some other actor plays Kevin in the third movie. I don't like it
user2: I think Kevin should be played by Culkin only :) he did a great job
user1: me too was not funnt
user1: funnny

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you
user2: Hello, I'am fine. Thanks. How are you?
user1: I am great, thanks for asking. Our movie is Home Alone
user2: Yes, it is Home Alone. Have you read this text already?

conversation:
user1: I enjoyed the movie Home Alone.  To me its kind of a cult classic.  What did you think of the movie?
user2: I agree with the critics. To me a lot of the story line was based around things happening that were completely implausible for an 8 year old to be able to do on his own. 
user1: I agree with that as well.  Even though the movie is funny, it does seem very implausible for a family to leave their child behind and not realize it and like you said for an 8 year old to be able to pull off some of those stunts really couldn't happen.  Are you a fan of John Hughes movies?  
user2: Exactly. How can parents travel all the way to the airport, board their plane, and fly to paris and not once realize they forgot their son?! I cant really say that Im familiar with any John Hughes movies other than Home Alone. I just realized Home Alone came out the year I was born, I cant believe its as old as I am!
user1: Well I am a lot older than you.  I had already graduated high school when the movie came out.  I am a fan of John Hughes movies.  I am also a great fan of Joe Pesci and I will say I think he did a great job in this movie. His portrayal of the bumbling thief was great.  He is a great character actor.  Do you have a favorite character in the movie?
user2: I agree, Joe Pesci did a great job with his portrayal of that character. Took it from what couldve been something forgettable and boring and turned it into something that is most definitely a classic and will be talked about for ages to come. I also always loved the mom for some reason. I think it was how she was just such an airhead. Always just kind of like "Uhh wait what?" like she didnt know what was going on.
user1: I agree with you that the Mom was a great character.  I am a little stumped right now as the assignment said I would get a new paragraph to discuss with you and I haven't received it.  So I will continue to discuss the document I have. Do you generally watch movies that have gotten a bad rating or review?  Or do you care about the reviews at all? 
user2: Same here. I was just wondering about that myself. Not too sure what to do haha. Generally speaking I tend to disagree completely with reviews. If they rate it badly, Ill probably love it. If they love it, I usually hate it.
user1: Well I still don't have a new document to discuss.  I don't know what to do.  If we abort we don't get paid but if the survey isn't working we still won't get paid because we will not have a code to put in.  I guess we can take turns talking a little more.
user1: I do agree with you that if a movie gets a good review, I will most likely not like it and if it has bad reviews then I will love it.  I do like the way Home Alone was made.  I think the director took a big risk making a child the star of the movie.  Macaulay Culkin really became a big star from this movie.  And I am sure this movie made a lot of money at the box office.
user1: I think I am going to abort this conversation and let the requestor know that this hit didn't work correctly.  Thanks for your time.  I enjoyed the conversation.

conversation:
user2: Hello. What movie did you read about?
user1: Home Alone. You should definitely watch it if you haven't.
user2: I have heard of it. I believe it came out when I was a kid. Is Maccauley Culkin in it?
user2: Not sure if I spelled that right!
user1: Yep. He plays a kid who was left home alone when his family goes on vacation. He's having fun, until some burglars try to rob the house.
user1: It's spelled Macaulay Culkin, so you were close.
user2: Is it suspenseful?
user1: Not very. More comedy. He booby traps the house with the kinds of things an 8-year old would come up with to get the burglars.
user2: I really like horror movies. Would you consider it somewhat close to that genre?
user1: No, it's a comedy. Not scary.
user2: Ohhhh I see. I enjoy comedies once in a while too.What is your favorite movie genre?
user1: I like comedies too. This one is up there. In the beginning, it's funny when a power outage turns off the clocks and makes the family oversleep. That's why they forget Keven (Culkin) at home.
user2: I am starting to remember the previews now!Daniel Stern is in it too...and Joe Pesci!?
user1: You got it. They play the burglars.
user1: Chris Columbus was the director.
user2: There was a sequel too...was there a third one?
user2: I feel like I really should have seen that movie by now, but I just hadn't gotten around to watching it. 
user1: Not sure. I only know about the first one.
user1: Another funny part is that the mom has to hitch a ride with a traveling polka band to get back home to Kevin.
user2: Ha. When do they realize they forgot him?
user1: They realize after they get off the plane for their Paris vacation, but there are no flights back, so the mom flies to the US but has to hitch that ride. It takes her a while.
user2: What is your favorite part?
user1: I think I just like the way Kevin booby traps the whole house. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine.
user2: Pardon me but what is a Rube Goldberg machine?
user1: Basically when one thing causes another thing to happen. So in this case, Kevin leaves traps where once one is set off, another is then set off. 
user2: Ohhhhh right!Kinda like the game Mouse Trap. Heard of it?
user1: Just like that game. , it all turns out fine in the end. The burglars get arrested and the family comes back.
user2: I feel like I could have guessed that. A little cheesy I bet
user1: Yeah, but that's expected for that kind of movie.
user2: Yeah. I did like the movie My Girl with MacCaulay Culkin. Total tear jerker. Have you seen that one?
user1: No I haven't. But if Macaulay Culkin is as good in it as he is in Home Alone, I'd watch it.
user2: Did you see the movie when it came out back in the day? Or did you recently watch it?
user1: I saw it back in the day, but am just now remembering all the specific plot points. I liked Catherine O'Hara as his mom.
user2: She was on Saturday Night Live yeah?
user2: I love her
user1: Not sure.
user2: Well, it's been nice chatting with you. Thank you for telling me about this movie! If it ever happens to be on TV, I will tune to it!

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hey so you saw Home Alone too?
user1: Yeah I saw it a  long time ago, But I don't agree with the critics, I think it is a great film
user2: Me too. What did you think of Macaulay Culkin?
user1: I think he was good in this movie, 
user1: He did a good job to sell the slapstick humor
user2: Me too.  I liked Joe Pesci too.
user2: Yeah he did, he is a great actor.
user1: Him and the Daniel Stern really carried the film
user1: without them, the film would have lost its soul 
user2: Definitely.  I can't believe someone described it as a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing".
user1: it is slap-stick humor, you need some "adult-bashing"
user2: True.  And look at the scenes with Buzz picking on Kevin.  There was plenty of kid bashing too.
user1: Yeah, How did you find the beginning of the film ?
user2: I thought it was a little sad that Kevin was being mistreated by his family.
user1: I think they went for something complicated as Kevin's traps to justify the fact that they forgot him. And they could have chose something less sad also.
user2: Yeah, they worked it in well to explain how they left him behind.
user1: And they also went for something complicated for Kate to go back to Chicago.
user2: Yeah that was cool that she got a ride with Gus.
user2: It was a really Christmas-y give-y kind of thing.
user1: Yeah, it was nice from him, she must have been really stressed out.
user1: Do you think she should have waited in Scranton with the rest of the family ?
user2: No, a mother would never wait.
user2: It paid off in the end too when Kevin saw her come back home for him.
user1: The others arrived soon after they met, so it was kind of funny 
user2: Yeah.  The best part was when Kevin set all the Booby traps though
user1: That was the climax of the film. I did not remember that the ending was in 2 parts, the burglars are catched and 1 day later the family arrives. 
user1: What are your thoughts about the movie ?
user2: I liked it
user2: I thought it was a good comedy
user1: have a good day

conversation:
user2: Hi there,
user1: Hello!
user2: That's strange, it gave me a different movie than I requested, but I love Home Alone, so whatever!
user2: Have you seen Home Alone?
user1: Only the first!
user1: it has been a while though..
user2: Cool, well, I love the movie. Great slapstick humor and a Christmas movie too
user1: Should i wait to watch it again during the holidays?
user2: Sure. My family watches every year. Good movie to bake cookies with.
user1: What year did the movie come out again?
user2: Even if you are completely familiar with the movie, still fun to watch. Hopefully it wont give me 4 year old daughter ideas about how to booby trap the house
user2: 1990
user1: 1990! Are the booby traps used in the movie actually useful? or just pure hollywood?
user2: paint cans on a string with stairs is fairly realistic
user2: A 10 year old using a blowtorch seems strange to me, but desperate measures...
user1: very much so
user1: I will give it a go again this winter!
user2: Absolutely. I dont think its real long
user2: Doesnt get a great rating from rotten tomatoes, but its fun
user2: When did you first see it?
user2: You stil lthere?

conversation:
user1: The final scenes were well praised by critics, how interesting
user2: I liked the rude goldberg machines used for the bobby traps
user1: yeah, I found those really funny when I watched.
user1: Culkin was greaT in the movie
user2: I always recognized the character played but I never knew that his name was Macaulay Culkin
user2: Referring to the actor that played the character
user1: he's pretty much only known as the home alone boy.
user1: It's odd the movie was rated so lowly
user2: It has  a CinemaScore of A but a metacritic  of 63. 
user1: Thats an astute observation
user2: I enjoyed the sadistic adult bashing as a child
user1: The family left him on a trip to paris, which is funny to me
user2: I liked that when he was left alone he relished the opportunity at first but then had to face the two burglars
user1: i thought the family was mean to him
user2: I agree that the family was mean for having forgotten about their own child
user1: his older brother was the meanest one
user2: I liked how following his fight with his older where he is punished, he wishes that his family could disappear, and then it comes true.
user1: and also they cant get a flight back
user2: Yes, their inability to get a flight  due to them all being booked forces Kevin to have to fend for himself
user1: he does well, though
user2:  I liked how his mother accepted traveling with the polka band because it shows how much she cares about Kevin
user1: not enough to remember him on the flight though, haha
user2: When you watch the movie, note that the heavy winds cause a power outage causing a power surge which causes the clocks to reset causing the entire family to oversleep and in the confusion forgetting Kevin. It's almost like a rude golrdbeg sequence of events leading to them forgetting Kevin
user1: you could say the events were similar
user1: good point there
user2: Do you generally enjoy movies of the Comedy genre?
user1: it depends
user1: im very critical of movies like home alone
user2: Do you agree with its rating?
user1: yes i think the rating is adequate
user1: though it has become a cult favorite nowadays
user2: I believe that movies such as Home Alone which were released in the 90's and did not receive stellar reviews are often later praised many years later and this is contrast to their original ratings
user1: i think it has to do with the majority of internet user's age being that of children when it was out
user2: I liked the movie although I generally do not like Comedy films. The  childish plot which is criticized appealed to my inner child.
user1: i agree
user1: im not sure i know many movies by the director
user1: i think harry potter
user2: In the critical response there is praise for the producer John Huges but not for the directory Chris Columbus
user1: oh wow
user1: the last paragraph is interesting
user2: I suppose he should get the majority of the credit for the plot and comedy since he is the writer for the movie

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user2: How's it going?
user1: Hello
user1: The movie is an American classic, Home Alone. Starring a really cute kid.
user2: Oh cool! Who are the main actors?
user1: Macaulay Culkin as the cute kid, Joe Pesci
user2: And who directed it?
user1: It also features Catheine Ohara. The movie is directed by Chris Columbus and is produced by John Hughes
user2: Nice. Did it get good reviews?
user1: Rotten Tomato report 62% 5.5/10 stars
user2: Hmm...not so good but what do review know anyways.
user2: So what is the movie about?
user1: About a kid who is left home alone completely unsupervised. A burglar enters the home and tries tpo terroze the boy but he terroized the burglar instead
user2: Ha! That sounds interesting. How did he get left alone
user2: ?
user1: His family flies to paris and unintentionally left him
user2: That's terrible parenting!
user2: Tell me more about how he handles being alone.
user1: At first he was afraid but after a while he began to enjoy himself

conversation:
user2: Hello.
user1: Hello! 
user1: Home Alone seems funny
user2: totally does.
user1: Kid must be smart to make all those booby traps
user1: I wonder where he learned that haha
user2: Did they ever explain that?
user1: I don't think so
user2: Maybe he just has imagination.
user1: Yeah 
user2: Rube Goldberg machines.
user2: They mentioned that on that prev document.
user2: They're cool. You should google.
user1: Yeah. Those are some amazing machines
user2: I actually am not the biggest M. Culkin fan?
user1: How could this family forget one kid though hahaha
user1: Ohh I don't know much of his work
user1: Chris Columbus...Almost thought it was christopher columbus or something
user1: You still there bud

conversation:
user2: hey how are you
user1: Hello! I am well, thanks for asking. The movie we got was Home Alone
user2: how is that movie?
user1: It is a good comedy. It has pretty good ratings from various film critics
user2: who stars in the movie
user1: Macaulay Culkin is the main actor. He plays the roll of Kevin McCallister
user1: role
user2: oh cool..so i assume it would be a good family movie to watch
user1: For the most part, yes.
user2: do it have any plot twist?4
user1: Yes. He is left at home while his family goes on vacation, so there are a few twists throughout
user1: Do you typically like comedies?
user1: Are you still there?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello, how are you? 
user2: Would you like to watch a heartwarming tale of parental neglect and wacky mishaps?
user2: Okay, maybe that's not the right angle. Do you like movies that take place around Christmas?

conversation:
user2: Do you see the document? I cannot.
user1: yes
user2: What is it about? I think only you can see it.
user1: it is about a movie called home alone, are you interested in it
user2: Yes. I have seen it before. Have you seen Home Alone before?
user2: I don't remember much.
user2: Can you give me a summary?
user1: yes i have, several times actually
user1: of course
user1: "The film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, a boy who is mistakenlyleft behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes beinghome alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars played by Joe Pesci and DanielStern."
user2: Oh yeah. I remember the 2 robbers. 
user2: Have you seen the sequels at all?
user1: yes ive seen all of them, you?
user2: No. Only the first one. 
user2: I was young though.
user2: I thought i heard they were going to remake it.
user1: Ahh ok, and i hadnt heard anything about that
user2: Who wouldn't notice their kid missing, right?
user1: thats what im saying
user1: pretty sad
user2: Times have changed I guess
user1: oh definitely, life is pretty weird now
user2: Do you remember where it took place?
user1: Yes, in "Peter and Kate's home outside of Chicago"
user2: I thought it was New York. 
user1: that is the 2nd one
user2: Maybe I have seen the 2nd one!
user1: lol it seems like it
user1: they are always on tv
user2: Macaulay Culkin was so young in them
user1: yes just a kid, now he is a weirdo
user2: Drug Addict
user1: yup such a shame
user2: Seems like all the childhood stars from the 80s/90s turned out like that
user1: id have to agree, have a good one

conversation:
user2: Hi, have you seen any good movies lately?
user1: I actually have. I know it's an older one, but with the holidays not long ago, I watched Home Alone.
user2: My husband says we need to watch that every year around the Holidays! I still havent seen it
user1: You really should. It's Macaulay Culkin's best role by far. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are absolutely hilarious in it.
user2: Is it a comedy then?
user1: It is in fact. It's a family comedy, so it's appropriate for all ages.
user2: Oh cool something to watch with the family
user2: Is it really Christmas oriented or would we enjoy it year round?
user1: Of course you would have to do it with the disclaimer that the little ones don't make the traps that Kevin makes do catch the robbers.
user1: It's really entertaining at anytime of the year
user1: It has a good sequel that includes most of the cast from the first movie as well
user2: Oh lol good idea ;-)
user2: Im not usually into sequels, do you think they do a good job on this one?
user1: Some people actually like the sequel more than the first film, but there's no denying the first one is a classic. It also includes some teachable moments for kids such as don't judge a book by its cover.
user2: Oh that is neat, especially around the Holidays, a good time to focus on those good moments
user2: While being funny at the same time
user1: Definitely. Not all the critics seemed to like it when it came out, but I've yet to see a kid watch it that didn't like it
user2: Is it very long? My kids are younger so they dont last through very long movies
user1: No. It's not excessively long at all, and there is enough action to make the time fly.
user2: How old is the movie? I enjoy "older" movies over the newer ones!
user1: It actually came out in 1990. It has that feeling of being nostalgic for adults while having a timeless aspect for the children.
user2: Well I guess I'll tell my husband we should watch it finally lol
user2: Wonder where I'd find it, especially this time of year. Blockbuster closed around here
user1: Basically, the lead character Kevin ends up home alone over the holidays and ends up devising some clever traps to stop his home from being robbed while his family tries to get back to him.
user2: Lol and are there actual robbers trying to break in?
user1: I would recommend trying to look at a library or you could get on a streaming device of come kind.
user1: There are. The one actually poses as a cop at the beginning to case the house that Kevin needs to defend
user2: Never thought about the local library! good idea
user2: Oh sounds like a clever kid too
user1: Some of the traps are hilarious
user2: Sounds entertaining for all of us
user2: Thanks for your suggestions, definitely going to have to find it
user1: It shouldn't be too challenging to find. I know it was on Cinemax this past December.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello! How are you? Did you enjoy this movie?
user1: I did enjoy this moive!
user1: It got a decent score on rotten tomatoes. Had you seen it before?
user2: So did I! I think that the idea of a child somehow being left behind during a family vacation is great. I had seen it once before. Had you? 
user1: I have as well. Do you know who the cast is?
user2: The only name that I was familiar with is Macaulay Culkin. Was this a film of your childhood as it was for me?
user1: Yes it was!
user1: What do you think of the critical responses? True in your opinion?
user2: Would you have chosen to watch this movie based on its plot, even if the ratings weren't as decent as they are? 
user1: I might have chosen to watch it still Hard to say since it is one of my favorites
user2: I think that the ratings are unflattering for the most part. To me, this movie was enjoyable despite some of the rather negative reviews that it received, critically. 
user1: Did you realize that they lived in Chicago and not some other city?
user1: Also, I can't believe they actually left him behind.
user2: Did you feel very bad for Kevin getting left behind, or was the scenario in which that happened too funny to feel bad for him? Also, I did not realize that it was located in Chicago!
user2: Also, I can't believe that this movie is 28 years old. Wow!
user1: Now as an adult I feel bad for him, but as a kid I think I thought it was more silly than anything
user1: OMG it really is 28 years old!
user1: Funny that it was heavy winds that caused the power outage since Chicago is the windy city. They were smart with the setting.
user2: I agree. Reading the description of how it happened - that he was sent to the third floor for punishment - is sad! 
user2: That is smart. I didn't think of that.
user2: Do you think it is realistic that ALL flights to Chicago were booked?
user1: It's so sad that Kate, the mom, wasnt able to get a flight back
user1: I don't think it is very realistic. Especially with the weather you would think that at least one seat was open
user1: What are your thoughts on her riding in a can with strangers? I mean it was a nice group of men in a Polka Band but still.
user2: I agree. I guess it was the only thing that made sense for the premise of this movie. Did you notice that the director's name was Chris Columbus? 
user1: OMG no! That is hilarious hahaha poor guy
user2: I personally don't know if I would have felt comfortable doing that, but I also don't have kids at this time, so I suppose the must have been desperate! 
user1: Polinski, that is a very polish last name
user2: Yes I can't even imagine having the name Chris Columbus! What a funny coincidence. And that is quite Polish! I didn't think of that.
user1: It is always so sweet when Kevin's family finally gets home!
user1: Also when he rigs the house, that is great. Smart kid
user2: Yes, so sweet! I couldn't imagine being without my family on Christmas Day, so I bet he was happy. This movie is so funny. I love the robbers getting caught in the traps.
user2: Are you familiar with the Rube Goldberg machines that one of the critics mentioned? I can definitely see the likeness of his booby traps to those.
user1: No I didn't know what Rube Goldberg machines were.
user2: Do you normally prefer to watch comedy movies such as this, or do you have another preferred genre?
user1: I love when Marley comes in and knocks the robbers out.
user1: I watch this for Christmas every year, but in general it depends on my mood
user1: But I think we are all done with the movie stuff. Thanks for chatting with me about it.
user2: Thanks!

conversation:
user2: This is a classic 
user2: The movie is amazing 
user2: Is "Home Alone" based on a book"?
user1: I am not sure.  I have only seen the movie
user2: Okay
user1: I liked the movie.  Fun get away from reality
user2: How many brothers and sisters does Kevin have?
user2: Yes truly
user2: Its my most favorite classic 
user1: I am not sure how many he had but I think there were relatives that went with on the trip and he got lost in the shuffle
user2: I thought those were his siblings 
user1: It was impulsive because it was meant to be.
user1: I do not think all of them were.  It was crazy in the  house when they were getting ready.
user2: I’ve always wondered what his parents did for a living to afford the trip
user1: I did not catch that either.
user2: Yeah
user2: We see in the sequel that he spends an awful lot of money everywhere he goes
user1: Thought is was a cute show.  Culkin's only hit I think.
user1: Now a very strange adult.
user2: I don’t know much about the actor
user2: But i assume he’s career didn’t turn out well
user1: I don't think it did.  He was in a few when he was a cute kid but then fell off.
user2: Was he drug addict or something 
user1: I believe so but when you have all the money you want and are bored, I can see someone slipping into the life style.  I don't agree with it but can see it happening.
user1: But I think the critics were a little hard on the movie
user2: But he earned it at a very young age. How could it possibly end his career
user1: Thought it was a funny plot.  There are not a lot of original movies any longer.
user2: Obviously 
user2: It had a lot of sequels
user1: They tried anyway.
user2: That itself sums up how good the first movie turned out to be anyways
user1: Can't remember the sequels.
user1: bye

conversation:
user2: Hi, I have seen this movie, have you?
user1: Yes I have
user2: it's great, did you like it?
user1: Yes I watch it every christmas
user1: It is tradition
user2: yeah same here. 
user1: It looks like these critics did not like it though.
user2: i know right Im surprised it got such low ratings.
user1: Me too. I always forget this is a John Hughes movie!
user2: wow I didn't even realize it was made in 1990, I wasn't even born yet.
user1: I know! I was born but we did not make it a tradition until later. 
user1: These critics are harsh. I think they missed the whole point of the movie...fun. 
user2: It's crazy I have my kids watch this movie and yeah totally.
user1: This new paragraph is an interesting perspective. 
user1: It makes it sound like the movie is on child abandonment. 
user1: Kind of...haha. 
user2: I know right it sounds very dark haa
user2: how do you forget your kid though, i mean really? lol
user1: A dark comedy. I know. My husband is one of 12 and no one was ever forgotten. 
user1: New paragraph. 
user1: I guess in this movie, we are following the mother instead of the child?
user2: tha's cool i don't know anyone with that many siblings. and yeah i believe so. 
user1: I guess the scene with the mother trying to get back is important. As it shows that once she discovered her missing child she did everything she could to return. 
user2: yeah she was really upset in that scene. 
user1: I like the end when she finally comes home. That is great. 
user2: yeah and she had no idea what happened
user1: I know, every parents worst nightmare and her child handled it like a pro. 
user2: how does a kid fight off two men literally trying to kill him? so crazy. I always wanted to try some of the things he did to if they worked haha
user1: It is funny as a kid watching this movie I always wanted to try some of the booby traps, because I was a kid.
user1: It always sounded like fun, or a prank I could pull on mom and dad. 
user2: yeah. and that last part where Buzz asked Kevin what he did and Kevin ran off. 
user1: Plus it is interesting to think that in the beginning he was being bullied by his older siblings.
user1: Haha just about to say the same thing. 
user2: Yeah they really loved each other even though they drive each other insane
user1: Siblings...
user2: YUP. haha, nice talking to you though! :)
user1: Then he gets lost again in the second movie. 
user1: You too. 

conversation:
user1: Hello, what is the name of the movie? 
user2: home alone
user1: Who is the main character of the movie?
user2: macaulay caulkin as kevin

conversation:
user1: Hey, watched any good movies lately?
user2: Have you ever seen the movie Home Alone? 
user1: I have not, who is in that one?
user2: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stem, John Heard and Roberts Bossom.
user1: Oh I like Joe Pesci a lot.. what type of movie is it
user2: Macaulay Culkin is the main character "Kevin" 
user2: It's an American comedy 
user1: Oh that one is about Christmas time isnt it? I've heard of it
user2: Joe Pesci plays Harry as a burglar.
user2: Yes, Kevin is left home alone 
user2: Are you interested in seeing it now?
user1: And hes a kid? How does that happen lol
user1: It sounds good, I might have to check it out
user2: Yes, he's 8! They left him on accident when they left to go on family vacation to Paris. 
user1: Oh wow, how does he do home alone?
user2: Okay at first but not soon after, hence the burglars lol 
user1: That would be scary as a kid!!
user2: They kept trying to burglarize the home and Kevin kept setting up booby traps.
user2: It was pretty funny, really. 
user1: So he is probably pretty clever then!
user2: Very much so.
user1: Does it have good reviews?
user2: Some of the critics were a little harsh of the movie, but you can take that with a grain of salt because the movie was amazing during it's time. 
user2: One said "sadistic festival of adult bashing"
user1: Oh wow!! It sounds entertaining though
user2: One says the films first half is "flat and unsurprising as its cute little premise suggests"
user1: Huh.. pretty harsh lol
user2: I will agree with one saying the booby traps would have been good if a kid has 10s of thousands of dollars. Cause they were pretty elaborate.
user1: Haha, yeah seems a little unrealistic !
user2: Rotten Tomatoes only gave it it 5.5/10. I honestly can't believe that rating. 
user1: Rotten Tomatoes is  a little hit or miss for me whether I agree 
user2: CinemaScore is A 

conversation:
user1: hi!
user2: hello
user1: I am looking for a movie recommendation
user1: Do you have anything you can suggest?
user2: so the movie is Home Alone starring Macaulay Culkin. Have you seen this movie before?
user1: Yes, I have, actually!
user1: I saw it when I was a little kid. I thought it was hilarious!
user2: Ok cool, Then you know it is a comedy made in 1990 and it actually got a rotten tomatoes score of 62%. can you believe that?
user1: Wow! I feel like that is really low! 
user1: It is a classic. 
user1: It is hard to believe it is almost 30 years old, though
user2: So its a comedy written by  John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus.
user1: It also had a bunch of sequels too, right?
user2: Macauley Culkin plays Kevin McCallister who is accidentally left at home when his big family leaves for christmas vacation in Paris.
user2: Correct
user1: I believe Joe Pesci is also in it?
user2: So  The family is at their families house in chicago gathering together before their trip to Paris.  The night before kevin and his brother get into a fight
user2: well kevin gets sent to the third floor as punishment where he makes a wish that his family would just disappear
user1: And he thinks his wish comes true! :)
user1: It is a fun movie to watch
user1: I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to understand it

conversation:
user2: home alone
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user1: Yes. Are you familiar with Macaulay Culkin?
user2: i use to love him as a kid
user1: Do you know who Joe Pesci is?
user2: Home Alone is my favorite Christmas movie
user2: I also like Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern
user1: Are you a fan of comedy in general?
user2: Yes
user2: What about you?
user1: Yes I am a fan of comedy. 
user2: What is your favorite part of the movie?
user1: (can only discuss from the document in front of us)
user1: Does the McCallister family seem like a traditional family from the document?
user2: not really. what regular family forgets the kid home?
user1: Given that the humor is described as "slapstick" I wonder if it would be reminiscent of The Three Stooges ...
user2: could be.
user2: I like that he had more fun at home that his family had in Paris.
user2: and i really didn't like Buzz
user1: Do you generally avoid movies with the ratings it has received? e.g. 62% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: i don't really pay attention to the ratings.
user1: The document states that the McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris. What do you think is an example of how they might prepare?
user2: i like to make my own oppinions
user2: the whole family gather at Peter and Kate's home but the are not very organised.
user2: the fact that the power goes out and the alarm is not working doesn't help
user1: "... where he [Kevin] wishes that his family would disappear." Do you feel that is common among young boys?
user2: for sure. all kids wish that at one point in life
user2: i feelt sorry for his mom 
user1: Who is the actress that plays his mom?
user2: how she strugles to get back home
user2: Catherine O'Hara
user1: Are you familiar with the concept of Rube Goldberg machines?
user2: no
user2: the beggining is boring but after Harry and Marv break in it's really interesting
user1: Given that the family is vacationing during Christmas time and they are American, do you think that they are a Christian household?
user2: probably.... he went to church to pray...
user2: I was glad that he got Marley's help
user2: i liked him
user2: and i was happy that he got his familly back.
user1: Given everything you've read of the above documents, is this a movie you would purchase a physical copy of?
user2: i already have it :)
user1: [final question] Does anything in the document make you feel that this movie might be sensitive for children audiences?
user2: no because Kevin is not hurt in any way and he wins in the end
user2: i use to watch this movie as a kid
user1: have a great day :)
user2: the same!

conversation:
user2: Hey

user2: can you tell me about the movie? what happens?
user1: however, it has a score of A in cinemascore

user2: i'm curious to know about what happens in the movie
user1: Basicly it follows a child story that have been left home alone while his family are on flight to france 
user2: why'd they leave the child alone? that's not wise
user1: the story goes that the child was ordered by his parents to go upstairs as punshmient for fighting with his brothers who are bullying him 
user2: poor kid
user2: what happens next
user1: then he wishes for his family to be gone. the electricity turns off leading to watches to stop and the family oversleep 
user2: what do they oversleep for?
user1: then they rush to the airport without realizing they left their child 
user1: sorry oversleep for the filght they booked to france 
user2: oh no!
user2: poor kid
user2: this seems like a family-oriented movie
user2: was it PG?
user1: I think so but I'm not sure 
user2: okay
user2: i'm not really a big fan of old movies or children's movies. i'm not sure if i would watch this

conversation:
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: Hello
user1: Hello.
user2: Yes!  I thought it was funny, what about you?
user1: This is one of my favorites ever
user1: The writing and directing was so good
user2: Macaulay Culkin is so awesome.
user1: He really is. He is way underrated
user1: Have you seen anything more recent he has done
user2: I can't believe the critics called it adult-bashing!
user1: Well the critics were adults after all
user2: Yes, agreed!
user2: Can you believe they forgot him in their rush to get to the airport?
user1: I know. I have alwasy wondered what that would feel like
user2: I mean, that is one part that I guess is a bit implausible, how do you forget your child?
user1: I know I never could
user1: I was once left in the grocery store
user2: Really!
user1: Yeah. I was about 10. Scared me out of my mind
user2: The parents didn't even know he was missing until they were halfway to Paris!
user1: That I dont know about. Seems a bit hard to believe
user2: I got back onboard with it all after his mother got on a flight back to him.
user1: I love the polka band
user2: Nice touch, eh?
user1: I always thought that would be a fun trip
user2: I'm glad they caught those burglars.
user1: The wet bandits if I recall correctly
user2: LOL!
user2: Well it has been fun chatting with you.
user1: I always wondered why they were going to paris
user1: You too
user2: Have an awesome day!
user1: Thanks you too
user2: Bye.

conversation:
user1: hi there
user2: Good afternoon. Seen any good movies lately?
user1: yes i have 
user1: how about you 
user2: Watched Disneys CoCo with the family lol.. enjoyed that
user1: i watched home alone
user2: I haven't seen that one
user2: Who plays in that
user1: machaly culkin
user1: big 90s actor
user1: an instant classic
user1: basicly the kid gets left home alone and burglars try to brake in  he comes  up with all ofthese intercate traps and its really funny 
user1: joe pesci is in it too
user2: Oh wow, a kid gets left alone, how does that happen lol
user1: you really havent  sen home alone?
user2: Must be a clever kid to come with all of the traps
user1: well basicly his parents and the cousins ans so on go on vacation  and  he gets left behind 
user2: Nope, my husband said we need to watch it, but its a holiday movie?
user1: oh yeah its awsome  you should watch it like today 
user2: What do the critics say?
user1: its all good its an anytime of the year movie 
user1: the critiics are way too critical 
user2: So does the kid keep the burlgars out?
user1: 66 rotten tomatoes 
user1: yup with stride
user2: Yeah I never know whether to trust rotten tomatoes
user2: Seems like a scary situation for a kid
user1: yeah the way its portrayed though is he gets over his fears and takes the burglars on 
user2: Is there humor too? Sounds like it could be comical
user1: why must people message you after youve told them 10 times you are busy lol?
user1: most defiantly 
user2: Lol must be really important ;-)
user2: I think I'll have to find Home Alone. Where can  rent it ?
user1: nope just rhetorical crap i could care less about 
user1: such as life though 
user1: vudu
user2: Oh thanks! I'm gonna look for it. Thanks for the recommendation. Have a good day!
user1: you may be  able to watch it for free or check out putlocker 

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1: not bad. you?
user2: Doing pretty good, thanks. Have you ever seen the movie, Home Alone?
user1: i actually havent seen this movie. I definitely heard of it though. 
user1: who is in the movie?
user2: Yea it's pretty old now. It stars an actor by the name of Macaulay Culkin as the little boy, if you know who that is.
user2: He never really played in anything else.
user1: Sounds like he was a one hit wonder.
user1: whats is the premise of the movie? 
user2: Yea pretty much. Well, there were three of the movies. I think he may have fallen into that child star drug addict thing.
user2: Ok, so this huge family goes on a trip to Paris, The morning is really crazy and hectic. They get to the airport. Get on the plane. Then suddenly they realize Kevin isn't there. 
user2: And then they have an adventure trying to get back home to kevin, while kevin has an adventure surviving at home alone.
user1: it always ends up rough for some of these child superstars.
user1: what happens while hes home by himself?
user2: Yea, we rely too much on parents to do what's right for them. And that doesn't work out sometimes.
user2: Well, at first he has a great time. He's enjoying the freedom and the power of having the whole house to himself
user2: But then some robbers who knew the family would be out of town show up and it becomes Kevin vs the Robbers.
user1: it actually sounds an interesting movie. 
user2: It was rated pretty low on most movie critic sites. But, honestly, if you know what you're getting into, it's not that  bad.
user1: how does he handle the robbers?
user2: It even has Joe Pesci in it as one of the robbers.
user2: Lot's of slapstick comedy ways. It's kind of like watching the three stooges. He drops stuff on the floor and they fall on it. He plays some video of a tough guy and puts the volume up and they think they are being shot at.
user1: sounds like the movie taken. is it a thriller type of movie.
user2: Haha yea it does, but no it's all child comedy. Even though the premise is pretty dark when you think about it like that.
user1: ohh ok i see. its more family oriented.
user1: whats your favorite scene?
user2: Very much so. In the end all is well, there's not really any twist here.
user2: Well mine, and everyone's favorite scene is when kevin realizes the family left without him. 
user2: He grabs his face with his hands and just yells AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
user2: It became a pretty classic movie scene.
user2: I'd recommend it around christmas time if your family is in a vintage type mood.
user1: i definitely need to watch this movie. 
user1: i think im one of the few people born in the 90s who hasnt seen it.
user1: lol
user1: So how does he ultimately get rid of the robbers?
user2: Haha yea probably, It was so big in the 90's it was hard to get away from it.
user2: Well, it's been fun talking with you. I hope you have a great rest of your day! Enjoy the movie if you watch it.

conversation:
user1: Hello! How are you!
user2: Good how are you?
user1: Fine!m thanks! So what’s your favorite holiday classic?
user2: Home alone
user1: Interesting, Is it your favorite because that’s the topic of the discussion or it truly is your favorite 
user2: Its the topic of discussion but it is my favorite next to christmas story
user1: Good ones! Which of the two would you say is the one you’d go to first?
user2: Well since we need to discuss home alone we should discuss that
user1: Cool! Did you know the film was number one in the box office for 8 weeks?
user2: I did not know that. 
user1: Yeah. I think it’s the highest grossing holiday film next to the live action grinch and die hard 
user2: That's awesome
user2: I think that Buzz was such a bully in this movie.
user1: Yeah I couldn’t really stand him and the family was a bit too harsh at times 
user2: He ate all of kevins cheese pizza then started acting out throwing up 
user2: That mother was a nut
user2: Always yelling at Kevin and praising Buzz
user1: And had he was blamed for a lot of the the stuff with not Justice involved! The mom said some cruel things 
user2: Do you think the flight crew could have done more when Kate discovers kevin was missing?
user1: I mean it was their fault and everyone else on the plane who paid good money and were more responsible shouldn’t have to stall their time to save Kevin. It’s an all for one or one for all scenario 
user2: That is very true. The storm knocked the phone lines out. 
user2: No one had cell phones back then
user2: Its really really far fetched that they made it on the plane with only 45 minutes to get on it from when they left the house.
user1: Yah and I’d doubt the pilot would take their word about Kevin. The film tries really hard to justify how a parent can leave their kid home like that 
user2: That would never happen. 
user2: I don't like how they do that.
user2: What about when Kate is in the moving truck with all those guys playing Polka music?
user1: Yah and those sequels make less sense to be honest but I guess we have to suspend our beliefs 
user1: Those were the nicest guys in the film!
user2: Now the booby traps kevin sets are crazy.
user2: Those things would have killed someone clearly
user1: He has to be the smartest kid character ever! I mean I’m an adult and can never think to pull those off 
user2: Me too! 
user2: He is so smart with that stuff. 
user2: Harry and Marv were not smart at all. They left the water running in all the houses they got so the cops knew. 
user1: I mean how he used to the recorded scenes from the movie was just too smart! Honestly he deserved all the fun from being alone 

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hi, are you feeling like you would go to the movies?
user1: Yes I'm interested.
user2: Or maybe rent, anything is reason to celebrate..I would like to talk about a movie called "Home Alone"
user1: Ok I'm interested. What's the plot?
user2: It is about this boy that is by accident forsaken from his family's holiday trip to Paris, and when he is enjoying the home for himself he notices that a couple of guys want to break in to rob the house.
user1: That sounds like a great movie. Any more details?
user2: It seems the first half of the movie is pretty calm. Then everything changes when the boy, whose name is Kevin, realizes that he has missed his family's trip and they also notice his absence.
user1: Awesome. Who stars in the movie?
user2: Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin, the kid left alone at home. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard play Kevin's parents; The would-be home burglars are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, and there is another character called Marley, that is played by Roberts Blossom

conversation:
user2: Hi! So what did you think of Home Alone?
user1: Loved it.  
user2: Same here! So who was your favorite character?
user1: 2nd one was great too, because Trump's in it
user1: I liked Joe Pesci
user1: Daniel Stern was funny too
user1: one more msg and we can move on
user2: Me too. Marv and Harry were brilliant.
user2: Can't help but agree with Cinemascore's rating of A.
user1: yeah, noticed the low score on Rotten Tomatos, don't get that
user2: True. 62% is way too low for this film.
user1: hmm, we should be able to move to next convo
user1: there we go
user1: I remember a lot of 'outrage' about it celebrating bad parenting.
user2: I felt sorry for Kevin at first while his cousins/sibling ridiculed him.
user1: I thought it was funny when he's 1st left alone and eating what ever he wants
user2: Left alone all because of a rush to get to the airport!
user1: yep
user2: Hard to believe of all people, they left their son. But that was the whole point of the movie.
user1: It's been years since I've seen it 
user2: Hard to believe it came out in 1990. I remember when Kate discovered in-flight Kevin was missing. That was hilarious. 
user1: Yeah, always liked Cathleen O'Hara from SCTV.
user1: Catherine
user2: Sucked when they got to Paris, all the flights were booked for two days. Glad she was able to find a flight back to the US.
user1: Then it kind of turned into 'Plane's Trains and Automobiles' lol.
user2: Haha! True! Luckily Gus was there to save her after she couldn't catch a flight to Chicago.
user1: Always thought flooding the house was much worse than robbing them.  That's just mean.
user2: Very true! They got what they deserved by being arrested after suffering various injuries courtesy of Kevin's booby traps.
user1: yep
user2: Luckily Marley was there to save Kevin by knocking Harry and Marv over the head with the snow shovel!
user1: very
user2: What was your favorite part in the movie?
user1: Probably the traps that Marve and Harry got hit with.
user1: Pretty ingenious for a 8 year old.
user1: And sad for grown men to fall for.
user2: Yeah that was hilarious and genius! Kevin was brilliant and Culkin played that role to perfection! Well it was nice discussing the 1990 comedy Home Alone with you today. Take care!

conversation:
user1: Hi! Have you ever seen the Movie Home Alone? If not, it's a classic you must see. 
user2: I have not, what's it about?
user1: Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin, accidentally gets left at home when the rest of his family foes to Paris on vacation.
user1: It was during Christmas.
user1: A couple of robbers try to break into his house and he fights back. Like sets up booby-traps to catch them.
user2: Is it a tragedy or a comedy?
user1: It was directed by Chris Columbus. Joe Pesci played Harry. 
user1: It was definitely a comedy. 
user1: It came out in 1990. 
user1: I remember it was such a popular movie when I was a kid. 
user2: So it's kind of a family movie then?
user1: Oh yeah, it's a great family movie. Any age will enjoy it. 
user2: Is it G or PG?
user1: I think it was PG. 
user1: Catherine O'Hara played Kevin's mom. 
user2: Paris on Christmas is pretty crazy. Do you know where they live?
user1: They lived outside of Chicago. 
user1: There was a storm that caused the power to go out the night before they were leaving to go on vacation so it messed up their alarm clocks. 
user2: So they almost missed their flight I'm guessing. 
user2: And ended up leaving the kid at home.
user1: Yeah, in the rush of getting up (they overslept) the left him.
user2: Are the robbers scary?
user1: Kevin was made at his siblings and cousins and made a wish they'd disappear. 
user1: So he got what he was asking for sort of. 
user1: It wasn't until halfway through the flight that his mom realized he was missing. 
user1: And then she had trouble getting a flight back. Everything was booked.
user1: It was just a funny cute movie. 
user2: Do you know if this movie did well at the box office?
user1: It did so so. I don't know why it didn't do better.
user1: Rotten Tomatoe scored it 62%
user2: Alright. Does the main character change at all, like for better or worse?
user1: It's been so long since I've seen it it's hard to remember, but I think he probably regrets wishing his family were gone once they were. 
user1: I'm sure he was scared when the people tried to break in. 
user2: Yeah, sounds scary for a little kid!
user2: Who would you say was your favorite character?
user1: Definitely Macaulay Culkin
user1: The robbers are pretty funny too, especially when they keep getting caught in Kevin's traps.
user2: Just a couple more questions.
user1: The cops end up coming and arresting them.
user1: What?
user2: Is there any notable music in the film?
user1: Kevin is sad when his family still isn't home for Christmas, but then he hears his mom.
user1: I don't remember about the music. 

conversation:
user1: The movie is Home Alone. It's a hilarious comedy starting Macaulay Culkin.
user2: What's the movie about?
user1: It's about a boy who is mistakenly left behind when his family goes to Paris for Christmas
user2: Does he just have wild parties?
user1: No parties. He's an 8-year-old kid who has to deal with criminals. 
user2: It sounds fun. Is it old?
user1: It came out 27 years ago. 
user2: Not sure why I haven't heard of it before. Might need to check this out
user1: You should. It's a classic!
user2: Who else is in the movie?
user1: Joe Pesci as Harry and Daniel Stern as Marv. (the bad guys)
user2: Joe Pesci is a good actor. What do they want?

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you today?
user2: hi, im great
user1: Good, what movie are we talking about
user1: ?
user2: have you seen home alone before
user1: I have not, but I heard a lot about it. Was it good?
user2: it's a comedy and really funny it's from 1990
user1: What exactly is it about? Just a child that stays home from school?
user2: Macaulay Culkin plays the main Character that is left behind during a Christmas trip with his family
user1: How long does it take until his family notices?
user2: the family doesn't find out until they arrive in Paris
user1: haha wow. They must have a very large family.
user1: How does the child survive?
user2: He goes to the grocery store and buys food 
user1: Oh, that sounds kind of boring. He has money?
user2: no, its really funny because some bad guys try to break in
user1: Ah ok. That does sound interesting. What does he do?
user2: it's funny because he hits them with lots of booby traps
user1: hahah. Does he ever call the police?
user2: no, he plays a movie that has a ganster scene where it's sounds like they are shooting a gun
user1: haha
user1: That's pretty funny
user1: what was it rated?
user2: yeah, the family finally realizes that he's missing and immidetely try to get back home they swap tickets with an old couple
user1: what happens to the robbers?
user2: they get arrested and go to jail
user1: What was it rated on rotten tomatoes?
user2: it was rated 5/10 but I think that it does not do it justice
user1: Yea, it's probably just because it's old. I'd like to watch it.
user2: it's got lots of slap stick comedy features which really make it great
user1: What other actors are in it?
user2: Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the bad guys
user1: Ah I see. Well I'll definitely check it out, thank you for the recommendation!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hi
user1: Let's talk Home Alone
user1: created 1990
user1: directed by Chris Columbus, starring Macaulay Culkin as Kevin
user1: are you familiar?

conversation:
user2: Hi.
user1: HI, how are you?
user2: Fine, want to talk about a movie?
user1: Sure
user2: Ever watched Home Alone?
user1: Yes, my 4 year old son loves it
user2: I remember I loved it as a kid aswell
user1: mccauley culkin was great
user2: Yeah, he was great as kevin.
user2: Joe Pesci was also great
user1: who played marv the bad guy? do you remember?
user2: It was Daniel Stern.
user1: he was hilarious
user2: Yeah, Joe Pesci as Harry aswell
user1: what was your favorite part?
user2: Has to be the third act where Kevin confronts the burglars with his home-made traps.
user2: And what was your favorite part?
user1: The traps are great, but I like when the scary next door neighbor saves him
user2: That was the best part.
user1: who plays his mom?
user2: I belive it was Roberts Blossom?
user1: hmm catherine ohara maybe
user2: Yeah I think.
user1: Pretty touching scene at the end with her also
user2: Yeah, who directed the movie?
user1: wasn't it john hughes?
user2: I'm pretty sure he only wrote the script
user1: Not sure then. Awesome movie though
user2: I think it was Chris Columbus who directed it.
user1: that sounds about right
user1: cheers have a good one

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: Hi! How are you?
user1: Have you seen home alone?
user2: No, I haven't hear about that movie. Can you tell me something about the film?
user1: Its about a kid left home alone
user2: Interesting, who plays the kid?
user1: mucaluay culkin
user2: I see, what is the movie's release year?
user1: 1990
user1: what else would you like to know?
user2: I don't feel that old to me, but I am from the 90's. Incredible how fast time passes. 
user2: What is the movie rating?
user1: I'm not sure. Anything else?
user2: Not even from Rotten tomatoes? Oh well. Well, could you tell me what should I take some time to watch the film?
user1: Its a good family movie, do you have kids?
user2: No, although I still live with my family.
user2: Could you tell me your favorite scene?
user1: It is a 62% of rotten tomatoes 
user2: It doesn't have a good rating, that makes think it is a regular movie.
user1: Reviews are opinions
user1: You might love it
user2: I don't know, with that rating the odds of actually being entertained or liking it are quite low to me.
user1: It has great actors like joe pesci
user2: I see, well let's try this. Could you give a short review by you?
user1: I already did. It's a movie about a kid left home alone. I think it is a great movie! I recommend everyone see it.
user2: That is rather short man, what does the kid do while he is alone? Or why is even left alone in the first place?
user1: His family mistakenly left him behind.
user1: AND THEY CANT MAKE IT BACK
user1: hello?
user2: Ok, I personally don't see why I should see this movie.
user1: ok fine
user2: Don't you have anything else to tell me?

conversation:
user1: Hello! How's it going?
user2: Hi there! Today we are talking about Home Alone.
user1: Oh boy, that's an old one.
user2: No kidding! Considering it scored an average of 5.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes it hasn't fared as well as one might think.
user1: Wow! I would've thought a cult classic like that would be rated much higher.  I think Rotten Tomatoes is garbage though.
user2: Yeah, I was surprised by that too. The metacritic score wasn't much higher-- 63/100. 
user2: One of the critics wrote it was a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing." lol
user1: Yeah, I really don't rely on many of those review sites.
user1: And it's supposed to be a children's movie, so wouldn't adult bashing justify it for children?
user2: Actually, you make a good point. 
user1: I mean, as long as it's not vulgar or anything, I would think that it's acceptable.
user2: Agreed, and it's not like any eight year old couldn't devise the same sorts of booby traps. 
user2: Though the scenario hasn't particularly aged well. Seeing as Kevin gets left behind simply because the power went out and the alarm clocks reset. 
user2: Are you still there?

conversation:
user2: Home Alone
user1: What is it about?
user2: a kid who gets left behind when his family goes on vacation
user1: Who is the lead actor?
user2: macaulay culkin
user1: is this a drama or comedy?
user2: comedy
user1: when was it released?
user2: 1990
user1: is it a family movie?
user2: yes
user1: so my kids can watch it?
user2: sure
user1: tell me a little more about the plot.
user1: or better yet, how was the kid left behind?
user2: while the kid is left at home alone, two burglars  break in... 
user2: not in info
user1: did he call the police?
user2: not in info
user1: was it based on a true story?
user2: not in info: He was left behind when he was sent to his room for fighting 
user1: is this movie based on a true story
user2: family overslept and in the confusion ; kid was left behind
user1: where is the setting of this movie?
user2: Kevin's home... the kid
user1: did the two burglars ever get in the house?
user2: Yes they do
user1: wow, do they hurt the kid?
user2: No. He actually hurts them
user1: how old is the kid in the movie
user2: 8 years old

conversation:
user2: hI there let's chat
user1: Let's chat about Home Alone
user2: yes that's good.  Did you enjoy the film?
user1: I did. I thought it was funny and simple. Nothing complicated to process. Did you enjoy the film?
user2: I found it okay.  What that kid thinks up.
user2: He really sets out some traps.
user1: He does what he thinks he needs to do to keep the burglars away 
user1: His traps are very elaborate 
user2: Right!  Lots of imagination used in traps.
user2: I wish I would be able to be as clever.
user1: They almost seem impossible for one child to put together himself 
user2: I see it is from 1990 
user1: Yes, it's quite a dated film now
user2: Did you enjoy the fact that he could be left behind?
user2: Never would have happened in my family.  We count heads.
user1: I think it's a storyline that they could get away with in 1990, but they wouldn't be able to do something like that today.
user1: My family is very vigilant about who is where as well
user2: Hey are you still there?
user1: I find it hard to believe that a child can walk around New York all by himself
user2: What's up with this chat?
user1: I am here. Are you seeing my messages? 
user2: I know that it wound't happen in this day.
user2: Finally used the scroll bar to see you.
user2: It was a fun film and I can enjoy his imagination.
user1: It is definitely a fun holiday film that I believe people will keep enjoying for a long time
user2: I like Joe Pesci.  Strange roles.
user1: He plays the villain quite well 
user2: And now there is at least one spin off.
user2: Yes, he's funny on his own.
user1: I know Joe Pesci and the other actors from Home Alone are in the second installment 
user2: OIC I havent seen the second one yet.
user1: I think Home Alone is the best out of the entire franchise 
user2: Well, I guess I need to go see it again.

conversation:
user1: morning
user2: Good morning!
user2: I am surprised that Home Alone only has a 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. It's a classic!
user1: like stupid funny movies
user1: critiques don't know how to laugh
user1: It was funny fun to watch
user2: Very true, plus the cast is amazing! Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, and Catherine O'Hara!
user1: fitting them into one movie
user2: John Hughes movies always remind me of my childhood and movies I watch on holidays.
user1: This was my childhood movie lol
user2: I admit the premise is wild (I mean who takes their entire family to Paris for Christmas?), but I didn't care about that because it was fun from beginning to end.
user1: Wasn't that how all movies were?
user1: this non fictional criteria of American society all being wealthy living in large houses traveling to paris in the 90s made a lot of people homeless and in debt
user2: Back then yes, we really didn't care about how likely something was in the plot, we could still identify with the character, for sure. 
user2: Can't believe this movie is almost 20 years old!
user1: Another one with him in it was richy rich
user1: Makes me feel old
user2: Oh my goodness Richy Rich, wow. I guess Macaulay Culkin always played the rich kid, didn't he?
user2: 90's was all about money.
user1: yeah
user1: and it ruined him
user1: like most 90s teens
user1: Home alone 2 was okay
user2: He didn't do much else, from what I can remember.
user2: Hahaha, the whole polka band stuff was hilarious too. Love those zany antics.
user1: For some reason I really obsessed over pizza 
user1: after watching the second one
user2: Pizza was the ultimate 90's food.
user1: pizza is one of those meals
user1: that just looks good to watch someone eat
user2: I mean, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? All those 90's pizza commercials? 
user1: omg
user1: pizza pizza
user1: lil ceasers
user1: was my goto place
user1: but really
user1: was the cafeteria pizza at school
user2: So good! I was just thinking about all the booby traps that Kevin set up in the movie. You'd have to be a physics major to pull those off.
user1: lol
user1: guy was a genious
user2: & his older brother Buzz! That was relatable for me.
user2: I had an older brother.
user1: Lol buzz
user1: typical brother
user2: Reminds me of a younger version of the Weird Science brother.
user1: Never heard of that one
user1: You take care and have a nice weekend
user1: Was a refreshing convo
user2: You too! Thanks! I'm gonna go have some pizza!

conversation:
user2:  Hello 
user2:  Looks like we have home alone but I don’t think I’ve seen that movie 
user1: Do you like comedies? Macaulay Culkin was funny in it and the movie got a great rating on CinemaScore
user2: And looks like rotten tomatoes didn’t like it as much.  I do enjoy comedies.\
user1: No, Metacritic was under par too
user2:  Looks like Joe Pesci was in this movie to he’s really funny 
user1: Yes he was a big part of it. The kids family left him behind, and of course trouble ensued
user2:  That makes sense. Oh this looks like a Christmas movie to 
user1: But ratings found it to be all over the place, not enough action throughout
user1: yes, holiday film
user2:  Oh yeah I guess I could explain the rating are all over the place I honestly didn’t even know rotten tomatoes around in the 90s 
user1: me either! Yes they spent Christmas in Paris, well all except Kevin who was left behind
user2:  Oh man looks like get a big family too so with the mom forgot him
user1: Guess that's understandable then. At least he didn't have to deal with being grounded anymore.
user2: Haha true
user1: They say be careful what you wish for lol
user2:  It seems like a perfect Christmas type movie where things go wrong and then they come together Justin time 
user2: Even looks like two pair a little stories the family trying to get back and Kevin’s life while they’re gone
user1: Yes and how lucky of Kevin's mom to have been able to hitch a ride with a band
user1: lots of eccentricity all the way around with this one
user2:  Yeah I just saw there was a polka band 
user2:  Got to be a eccentric then 
user2: But fun
user1: yes definitely
user2: Oh is this kind of slapstick with the robbers like three stooges 
user1: Smart of Kevin to rig the house with booby traps, every little boy's fantasy to be able to prank people
user2:  A lot of physical comedy I guess 
user1: yes definitely
user2:  Oh man I need to see this movie I guess sounds cute and I think my kids might like it 
user1: I think so too, it's funny. hope you guys enjoy it 
user2:   Thank you have a good day 
user1: you too

conversation:
user2: Hello! What movie are we chatting about today?
user1: Home Alone
user2: Ohhhh, a classic. :)
user2: I have not seen it in a long time. What year was it actually released?
user1: Yes, definitely a classic! And 1990.
user2: Wow. I cannot believe it is that old. One year after I was born! Ha.
user2: I am curious- do you know what kind of ratings it received?
user1: Even though it's a classic, the critics call it unsurprising and predictable. As an adult who's watched it as a kid, I probably wouldn't be interested in it anymore
user2: I guess those ratings do make sense! It is a kids movie. And from what I remember, a bit cheesy.
user2: I do like watching the classic movies, like Home Alone, around Christmas if they are on TV. I don't care if they are cheesy or not. 
user1: Yeah, definitely. They also call the traps that Kevin uses as too elaborate, and would only be feasible if you had a large budget and a large movie crew. Haha.
user2: LOL, he is a crafty kid but always seems to have the right materials at his disposal!
user2: Are there any other "big name" stars in the Home Alone cast? I kind of forget...
user1: None that I know of, besides Macaulay Culkin
user2: Yeah, that's what I was thinking! 
user1: Yeah, it doesn't seem to star too many of today's well known actors
user2: I could never understand how Kevin's family never realized he wasn't with them, until it was way too late. Haha
user2: Not the most believable story!
user1: Yeah, precisely. It seemed everyone had short term memory loss for about 45 minutes until they realized he wasn't with them
user2: So funny.
user2: Did they hop on a plane in the first one? I vaguely remember.
user1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure they hopped on a plane to France
user2: I saw the second Home Alone around Christmas this year and they all kind of blend together!
user2: Ohhh yes you are right. 
user1: Oh, what did you think of it?
user2: It wasn't bad! Kevin was alone in NYC, so he got into some mischief in the streets of New York and ran up his dad's credit card bill. Haha
user2: There's a third one as well but I believe Macaulay does not play Kevin in that one.
user2: That's where I draw the line.
user2: Are you still there?

conversation:
user2: hi

user1: Does it.sound like.any other.film u have seen
user2: hmm i cannot recall
user1: Do you watch alot of.comedies
user2: i do agree that if they film maker had more budget....the scenes could have been much better especially with the stunts
user2: since some seemed unreliastic
user2: yes, i watch all genres
user2: if i like trialer... i watch it...it's that simple :)
user1: Yes things are more humorous that are stunted well. Otherwise, they seem.very silly
user1: Yes the movie trailer always shows the.best of the.movie
user2: agreed
user2: i dont agree rotten tomotates rating of 63
user2: it deserves much higer rating
user1: Although, often they do have some suprises that they do.not.show you.until the movie itself
user2: & even the average rating of 5.5 is meagre
user1: These are always a.good.suprise and keep it.interesting
user2: dont understand how films are rated though
user2: yeap
user1: Yes.not a good rating
user1: Isnt.it an.older movie?
user2: do you know any other movies directed by chris columbus?

conversation:
user2: hello!
user1: Hi!

user1: Yes I love that movie
user2: Theres a second one, isnt there?
user1: Yes, it is set in New York.
user2: I can't even remember if I've seen it or not. 
user2: I'm surprised it had gotten such low ratings.
user1: It isn't as memorable as the first.
user2: haha that must be why I don't remember it!
user1: They also made a 3rd and 4th movie too.
user2: Why do I not know that haha I need to catch up on them then. 
user1: Those were really terrible.
user2: oh, then maybe not!
user1: Yeah, the main actor was replaced by the third.
user2: that would make for a crap movie then. 
user2: i like when the original actors are in all the sequels. 
user1: When did the first movie come out originally?
user2: 1990
user2: I was 3 lol
user1: Haha I was born 2 years later
user2: nice!
user1: That movie came out over 25 years ago lol
user1: I feel old now
user2: I know; thats crazy to think about hahah 
user2: I have kids of my own so it's hard for me to think how can you leave your kid at home and not realize it haha
user1: Not once but twice also
user2: right! 
user2: it would be quite the adventure though!
user1: And a quick visit by Child Services lol
user2: hahha that has me giggling!
user2: They should just get all the originals back together for one last movie.
user1: Have Kevin be the parent that loses his own kid this time.
user2: omg yes!!! I would pay to watch that, for sure!
user2: have a good day!!!
user1: See ya nice chat!

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user1: Which movie are we chatting about
user2: hi
user2: We are chatting about Home alone
user1: oh yea, saw that over Christmas break. Hard not to watch it during Christmas.
user2: Oh yes it's such a great movie
user2: great movie to watch it has good slapstick humour
user1: My 4 year old loves it, minus the furnace scene which actually scares her
user2: especially in the second half into the movie
user1: Oh yea, love the stairs and the paint scene too
user2: I can imagine her being scared. 
user2: haha oo yea the two burglars played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern-  they were too funn
user1: Made me want a BB gun haha
user2: hahaha, 8 year old Kevin wished his family would disappear, and he got exactly that
user1: Doesnt quite work in real life
user2: I know, if only it did especially if you being ridculed by your siblings and cousins
user2: fights with old brother and getting punished for it!!
user1: Naturally
user1: I might actually watch it again soon. better than some of the animated movies my kids watch
user2: It's definitely a good one to watch all over again. Its one of those movies you just can't get enough of
user1: Egg nog and Home alone
user2: What would you if you do if you discovered in mid-flight that your daughter  was missing on arrival to Paris?  And all flights for the next two days are fully booked
user1: Find a van with John Candy init, and drive to a different airport.
user1: Seriously though I dont know
user2: HAHAHA 
user2: oo yes that wouldn't be funny at all
user2: Especially if it's not a direct 2h flight, but a 7+ hour flight including numerous flight changes 
user2: I have to say though, for a 1990 comedy movie- its still one of the best Christmas movies 
user1: she could handle that
user1: totally
user1: NOt really.
user2: loool the two guys that broke into the house
user1: its still funyn to mos tadults
user2: o yes i agree
user1: Seems like an extremely long chat this time
user2: Atleast the rest of the family joined both Kevin and his mum on christmas day eventually 
user1: Right, and his brother commends him for not burning the house down
user2: i knoww, i was thinking that- the chat is quite long
user1: Funny, because we are talking quite thoroughly about the movie
user2: haha we got an interesting movie
user1: Yea, pretty common one too
user2: are you still there

user1: Hello there, how are you?
user2: I'm fine thank you. How are you today?
user1: Good! When was the last time you watched Home Alone?
user1: Joe Pesci was hilarious
user2: It's been at least 5 years. 
user1: This was one of the few comedies that I enjoy watching over and over
user2: I agree, it's one of those comedies that never gets old.
user1: Christmas vacation is a hectic time of the year no matter who you are
user1: They were lucky to be able to travel to Paris with the whole family
user1: Kevin's booby traps really demonstrate how imaginative he was
user2: Unless your the kid that gets left at home. Then your not so lucky.
user1: Well, maybe he was lucky because he felt less than appreciated around that house, as the youngest
user2: He did seem to enjoy himself
user1: Do you remember the character "Peter"?
user1: I can't remember who that was
user2: I believe peter was his father bit I could be mistaken
user1: Oh yeah! you're right. It's hard to believe that was 1990
user2: Haha yeah it doesnt seem that old.
user2: I enjoyed the originality of the booby traps, like the hot iron
user2: Or the hair spray on fire
user1: This movie demonstrates exactly why you should plan to be ready early, as the rush caused Kevin to be left behind. I would have had to lay eyes on my child before leaving. That's just me
user1: yes, he messed them up bad
user2: Yeah I'm not sure how realistic the premise of leaving your child behind is, but it made for a good plot
user2: I don't remember, where they stealing something specific or just trying to rob the house?
user1: Just trying to rob houses for Christmas
user2: Thats a lot of effort for one house. 
user1: They should have given up while they had the chance
user2: Do you know the names of the burglars?
user1: Harry and Marv
user1: He ended up having a blast though. He completely owned those burglars
user1: I think it crushed their egos that they couldn't beat a kid
user2: Yeah he was a pretty crafty kid
user2: Messed the house up pretty bad too I think
user2: Glad it wasn't my house
user1: Why didn't he just call the cops?
user1: And did his parents try calling the house?
user2: Haha, right. That would have been a great idea to start with. 9-1-1
user2: I will have to watch it again soon
user1: I wonder if Buzz felt bad 

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: hello
user2: seen any good movies lately
user1: Home Alone
user2: What's the story about
user1: It's a American comedy from 1990 about a boy that gets left behind when his family flies to Paris. He has to learn how to survive Christmas without them.
user2: Is it worth watching
user1: Yes, there is a little plot twist too.
user2: what kind of twist
user1: After his parents leave, a couple of burglars attempt to break into his home, knowing the kid, Kevin, is all alone.
user2: that sounds pretty funny
user1: It is.
user2: who plays kevin
user1: He sets booby traps up on them.
user1: Macauley Culkin
user1: Also Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern play the bank robbers
user2: Oh yeah, that sounds like a good movie
user2: so you would recommend it?
user1: Yes, others would too.
user1: Cinemascore rated it as an A.
user2: Is it more a holiday film?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 62 percent score.
user1: Yes, definitely, it is a Christmas movie.
user2: I might have to check it out next year
user2: how long is it?
user1: I don't have that information but it goes by really quickly.
user2: Okay thanks
user2: It was great chatting with you today
user1: You too, is there anything else you would like to know before we finish the conversation. I think I need to tell you a little more before that happens.
user2: Okay
user1: John Hughes wrote and produced it.
user2: Is there a theme in the movie 
user1: No, it's just a happy memorable film. I just wanted to tell you that, You should watch it. It was nice chatting with you. But I think I convinced you.
user2: yes you did, good job
user1: thanks, bye
user2: Bye

conversation:
user1: Hello! How did you like the movie Home Alone?
user2: It was entertaining, funny, and moving. How did you like it?
user1: I thought Culkin did a nice job as Kevin McCallister. It was entertaining
user1: But it has mediocre reviews. I wonder why
user2: I was just noticing that. 
user1: Yeah but the CinemaScore gave it an A. So I guess that is fair
user2: It has a cinema score of A though, so that's good at least
user1: yep :)
user1: It came out in 1990. How time flies!
user2: Makes me feel old! 
user1: Ha yeah. Almost 3 decades ago haha
user1: Did you lke Joe Pesci and Daniel Stem as the burglars?
user2: Yes! I'm a fan of Stern especially. I've always enjoyed his acting. 
user1: Oh really? Cool!
user1: I like Joe Pesci! Funny guy!
user2: I could help but think "Why not just call 911 when the robbers first show up?" haha
user2: couldn't*
user1: Yeah. that's a fair point!
user2: it wouldn't be near as entertaining though of course, so obviously that's why not.
user1: Home Alone: A Kid left alone calls Cop?
user1: hehe
user1: Okay let's go over the next Scene
user1: Imagine you are in the airplane and find out you forgot your kid at home...
user2: I'd be a basket case! Full of panic, as well as guilt ridden. Like how does that even happen?
user1: So when they landed she tries to find a flight back to the US only to find out all flights back to the US are booked
user2: I'd be so stressed out! At least she was luckily able to meet a nice guy willing to help get her back to Kevin though.
user2: That had to have been uncomfortable riding with someone you don't know though, and a polka van? Random! haha
user1: Yeah.
user1: Polka van. All the way from Pennsylvania to Chicago
user1: Meanwhile Kevin is fending the house off the burglars
user1: Sounds scary but actually I wonder if he is having fun at it
user2: A kid setting booby traps? Definitely having fun! 
user1: And the burglars dumb enough to fall for the booby traps ;p
user2: I bet he was so relieved when he saw his Mom though
user1: A few nights before Kevin was not happy with the family but now he is so glad to see his family back
user2: What makes someone decide "Hey, I just robbed this house, I better flood it too before I leave!?" haha
user1: yeah 
user1: that is wacky!
user1: Hey thanks for chatting with me! it was a good conversation
user2: Thank you as well! 

conversation:
user2: Hi! So what did you think of the 1990 comedy Home Alone?
user1: Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did.
user2: Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film?
user1: Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men.
user2: Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well!
user1: Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be.
user2: Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half "flat and unsurprising".
user1: Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it
user2: I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990! 
user1: I like the quote "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright.
user2: That is true! Ha! Pesci and Stern did a great job acting the part as adults who weren't very bright! John Hughes wrote the movie perfectly!
user1: I related to the character Kevin being made fun of  by his family since kids deal with that all the time. The part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me.
user2: Same here! I honestly felt bad for Kevin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind. Like you, i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it.
user1: I wonder what kind of job Kevin's dad worked that he could afford to fly that many people to Paris for christmas. I blame him for all of this!
user2: That is true! And plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure.
user1: How much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being. I guess nobody in the McCallister family was an early bird either. Alarms didn't always exist.
user2: No kidding! I wonder that as well! Then they don't even realize he's missing until Kate discovered it during the middle of their flight. So awful!
user1: I couldn't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band. I found that part very funny.
user2: Same here - and in a moving van at that. That was incredibly hilarious!
user1: Imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip. That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.
user2: I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!
user1: For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.
user2: Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!
user1: Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.
user2: You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!
user1: I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.
user2: It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.
user1: I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone. I would figure the police might be interested to talk to Kevin's parents.
user2: I agree but it was hilarious when Buzz yelled "Kevin what did you do to me room?" and Kevin ran off at the end. I enjoyed discussing Home Alone with you today!

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you? How did you like the movie Home Alone?
user1: Hi... I'm good, how are you? Yes, I did like the movie. Did you?
user2: Yes I think it was a nice movie. Culkin did a great job as Kevin MacAllister
user2: And so Joe Pesci and Daniel Stem !
user1: Agreed. I liked the tricks he played even if the reviews say they were too staged and unrealistic. 
user2: well there is some truth to that but still it was fun
user1: Did you agree with the ratings of the film?
user2: I think it deserves better scores.. 
user1: I agree. It's a classic.
user2: Anyways it was a very enjoyable comedy film
user1: Do you usually like comedies?
user2: Sure! I like cheerful movies.
user1: I did not like that Kevin got left behind by his family. 
user2: It was funny when the family realized their Christmas in Paris turned into a nightmare haha
user1: Very funny. I can't imagine how one leaves a child behind.
user2: It was a family trip with so many people.. Kevin has siblings and they went on the trip with Kevin's cousins as well
user2: But you are right. How could the parents forget their child!
user1: True true. Rough Christmas for Kevin.
user1: At least his mom turned back around for him.
user2: All flights booked on Christmas :p
user1: How did they not realize until mid flight?????
user2: Yes very unfortunate..
user1: Still shocking to me lol
user2: It must have been a nightmare for the poor lady who scrambled her way back to Chicago
user2: Hmmm.. #3 is missing some important scenes. Well anyways
user1: Must have been
user1: Right, all the high jinks!
user2: Marley... saves Kevin's day!
user1: Yup
user1: Kevin kept quiet about Harry and Marv to his family, which surprised me.
user2: Well Kevin is now sad that he is all by himself. A few days earlier he did not appreciate his family much
user2: you are right
user1: Right. He should have been ecstatic to be home alone!
user2: nice chatting with you!
user1: Besides the robbers of course
user2: good night
user1: Nice chatting with you too

conversation:
user2: Hey!
user1: Hi there.
user2: How are you?
user1: Great! Thanks for asking, you?
user2: I am doing fine, so what is the title of the movie my friend?
user1: So the title of the movie is Home Alone.
user2: The very first Home Alone movie? I loved that when I was a kid!
user1: Haha me too.
user2: I mean who would not? I feel like I wanted to be home alone too when I was a kid for most of the time too when I watched that movie and try to survey my house and imagine different kinds of obstacles if robbers were to enter hahaha
user1: Ohhh right right.
user1: I would be scared though when I was a kid if trespassers where to well trespass my home hahaha.
user2: Yeah, it just depends, but realizing it now, I feel like it is impossible to fool anyone with the obstacles Kevin deployed in the movie.
user1: Come to think of it, you are right, although the movie was very fun to watch when I was a kid, especially if you watch it on the holidays.
user2: Absolutely, Christmas is the best, so tell what is the movie rating for it?
user1: It got a Rotten Tomatoes rating at 62%.
user2: Wow, that is lower than I expected.
user1: Same here, I can't believe these critics. Anyways, I feel like I remember the sequel compared to the first one haha.
user2: I don't know, the first one was a bit more believable than the second since it was his home and not the hotel right?
user1: You may be right.
user2: But in all honesty, both are not so realistic hahaha.
user1: Yeah, still fun movies though and always be a part of my childhood.
user2: True that.
user1: Oh wait I feel like the first one was actually better because of one scene that was realistic in my opinion.
user2: What was the scene?
user1: Where Kevin put a lot of fire crackers in like a sauce pan to simulate gun shots, I know its a bit exaggerated but the sound to me is very close to gun shots hahaha.
user2: Oh yeah, I remember that scene.
user1: Although shooting from inside the house to tresspassers you do not have a visual on is simply nuts hahaha
user2: Yeah, I can't recall the other scenes anymore, that is why I might have to watch it again when I am in the mood.
user1: Definitely definitely. Anyways thanks for the great conversation! Good day!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: Macaulay Culkin as Kevin is one of my favorite characters of all time!
user2: Hello, How are you today.
user1: I'm great! How are you doing?
user2: Macaulay Culkin is good in most of his movies, what kind of character did he play in this one ? i'm great thanks 
user1: He plays a child who has accidentally been left home alone while his family goes on vacation to France.
user2: oh no that sounds terrible .... how did that happen ? 
user1: He was sleeping when they hurriedly left (they over slept) and accidentally counted a neighbor boy as Kevin.
user2: OMG that is incredibly funn and terrible at the same time ... so what did he do ? how long was he home alone ? 
user1: He took full advantage in the beginning. He ate all kinds of junk food, and watched movies. When he realizes that there are a pair of bumbling neighborhood burglars trying to get into the house, he sets all kinds of booby traps for them.
user2: that sounds really funny .... what movie is it ? did his traps work ? 
user1: He watches "Angels with Filthy Souls". A fictional gangster picture. His uncle previously forbade him from watching it, so naturally he is drawn to it.
user1: He ends up being successful with is incredibly creative traps. 
user1: Critics took issue with his traps. Saying they were unrealistic and implausible.  
user2: the gangster movie sounds amusing is it important to the plot other than being the "forbidden fruit"
user1: It is certainly integral. Kevin draws inspiration from it and uses the sound clips of the gangster making threats and using his tommy gun.
user2: the critics are critical of most things in films like this ... they probably thought him being left home equated to child abuse as well ... but in things of this nature you must suspend belief and just enjoy the hilarity as it was intended.  
user2: That's funny ... What movie is it ? i'd like to see it ! ... does his family come back for him ? do the cops come and catch the burglars ? 
user1: Exactly. Rotten Tomatoes wasn't too kind either, but the movie has a CinemaScore of an A
user1: Kevin's family doesn't realize they have forgotten him until they are somewhere over the Atlantic. When the land in Paris, his mother beings a problem-filled journey back home after the police in the hometown prove to be unhelpful. Since the phone lines are down, they can't even call Kevin
user2: good grief that must have been scary for his family ... ultimately they are reunited though right ? 
user1: They were ultimately reunited! Kevin realizes that despite being annoyed by his siblings and getting in trouble with his parents sometimes, he loves his family. 
user2: awesome .. What movie is it so i can go see it ? 
user1: John Heard and Joe Pesci are absoluely perfectly cast as the "Wet Bandits" So called because they plug drains in the homes they burgle. 
user1: Home Alone is the name of the film. I highly recommend it and watch it several times every Christmas.
user2: Thanks ... I will definitely rent it ! 
user2: who else stars in it ? 
user1: You really should. It has the perfect Holiday feel and ends with a great family reuniting feeling.
user1: Roberts Blossom is also in it. He plays an elderly neighbor who has troubles with his family. When Kevin befriends him (after being scared of him) he realizes that growing up and not having your family with you is a lonely and sad thing.
user2: how does he get to know him ? i mean going from scared to friend is not an easy thing
user1: There is a neighborhood rumor that the old man killed his family, so everyone avoids him. Kevin, while running from the bandits, ends up in a church watching a choir. Marley happens to be there too, watching his granddaughter. They end up talking in the pews and teach each other a valuable lesson.
user2: oh no ... does the rumor turn out to be false ? 
user1: Thankfully it does!
user2: i'm really glad it all works out in the end.  
user2: Thanks for the movie recommendation it sounds like something i would really enjoy ! 

conversation:
user2: Hey there, I believe you have the movie document. Please let me know the title of the movie and any information you have
user1: Home Alone is a classic movie that any kid that has ever been "home alone" can relate to on some level. It is a comedy with robbers falling down and getting hurt by elaborate traps trying to get them out of the house.
user2: That sounds like a fun light-hearted movie. Do you have any other details about it?
user1: It takes place in the suburbans around Christmas time. The main character is Kevin a young boy. He is left behind by his family as they travel for the holidays. The family scrambles to try to fly back home while Kevin defends the house from robbers who have been casing the house expecting it to be empty for the holidays.
user2: Is this a violent movie? Is this a movie that can be watched with a family with children?
user1: It is a family friendly movie. Some of the scenes would cause harm or death in real life but the robbers walk away with minor injuries. If you like comedies like 3 stooges or physical comedy then this would be right up your alley. Do you like comedies?
user2: Yes I like comedies, but I wouldn't want to show too many violent situations to children. If it were just me, though, this movie sounds a bit simplistic for an adult. Do you think an adult or an adult couple would enjoy this movie on their own? Or do you think this movie is more targeted towards children or families?
user1: I think an adult alone or as a couple could enjoy this movie. Any adult can remember their childhood and this movie takes was filmed in the 1990's. The violence is PG. There isn't any blood and those getting hurt always get right back up and are ready for more mishaps. This move is geared towards families. 
user2: That's a good point, these days with nostalgic childhood tv series like "Stranger Things" being popular, I could see this movie being enjoyable today by adults, too. As a child, seeing slapstick violence did not affect me negatively, I don't think. These days, though, I wonder if we as a society are over protective of our children. Do you think violence in movies is something that should be taken seriously, or do you think children are fine with a bit of light exposure?
user1: The movie has some great actors like Joe Pesci doing slapstick violence as well.  I think a small amount of violence can be acceptable to children but the context is most important. I don't think I was negatively affected either watching certain shows. Murder, rape, and beating spouses or children could have an effect on children. In the case of this movie, it is criminals so like a giant game of mouse trap hit a new obstacle in every room. This is like stranger things were things are going to jump out. It is like a train accident and you can't look away seeing what is about to happen.
user2: That sounds like a fun movie. It would be fun to think of creative ways to block entryways to a house. I agree that certain violent acts should be censored heavily for children. Have you personally seen this movie? Would you recommend it?
user1: I like the opening scene on how Kevin is left behind. He has several siblings and is fighting with his Brother "Buzz". He is sent to the attic as punishment. During the night a storm knocks out the power and everyone oversleeps their alarms. The house gets into a frenzy trying to get ready for the airport and leaves Kevin behind on the 3rd floor and don't realize until they are flying they forgot him. I've personally seen this movie several times. It is almost the best out of the other two sequels. I would recommend it.
user2: That's a good insight; when we're in rush mode, it's really easy to forget even the most important items. Maybe I'll check this movie out. You said this movie takes place around Christmas time. Do you often watch it around Christmas time?
user1: I do watch it around Christmas but it isn't a yearly tradition like die hard. It takes place up north so there is snow and Christmas lights all along the street. Do you want movies out of tradition at certain times a year?
user2: There are a handful of movies I think match the season, but I don't have any family tradition movies, per se. I will check this movie out. Thank you for the recommendation.
user1: Sure thing. It isn't on all the streaming services year around. It is seen as a Christmas themed movie. Did you ever stay at home alone when you were under 10 years old?
user2: I use a streaming service, so hopefully it will be available on that platform this Christmas. Yes, I have memories of staying home alone, although I'm not sure I was under 10 years old, that seems a bit too young to be home alone. What about you?
user1: I funny scene is when Kevin's mother can't get a flight from Pennsylvania back to Chicago for two days she hitchhikes with a polka band with John Candy. You get to follow their antics on a roadtrip with a polka band van. I agree I don't think I was ever home alone under 10 years old.
user2: Wow, I wonder what she was doing in Pennsylvania. Did they explain where the family was going for their vacation? 
user1: They were going to Paris for the holidays. The rest of the family continues on with the vacation. They are a large family too. They fill up a big like 15 passenger van on the way to the airport.
user2: Oh, I guess Pennsylvania was one leg of the flight to Paris. Wow, that is a very large family, I can see how they forgot one family member. Do you think their family is too big? Do you prefer a small family or a large family?
user1: I think that is too large of a family. I only have one sibling. I understand why people like to have large families because they are never alone and have a large support base. How about you? Any preference on family size?
user2: I also have only one sibling, and I think it was a good size. Small enough to feel important, but you wouldn't feel lonely. I know some families have three generations. What do you think about having three generations in the same household?
user1: I forgot to mention the movie has a happy ending and the family is reunited. There aren't any cliffhangers. Do you like movies that leave it open for a squeal? Three generations in a household seem like a lot but I think opinions on that have a lot to do with customs and is almost past on generation to generation.
user2: That's good that there's a happy ending. I think movies with cliffhangers are okay, but not very necessary. I do think that sequels can be positive, since we often get attached to a character and enjoy watching that character develop. That reminds of super hero movies these days. Do you think they have too many movies in succession?
user1: I think some of the super hero movies are coming out too fast. The first home alone move is the best of the three. It is funny that Trump is in the 2nd movie and gives back directions to Kevin at his hotel in New York.
user2: Oh wow, that is funny. Yes, I feel often the first of a franchise is often the best. Although that might just be survivorship bias. What are some of your favorite movie franchises?
user1: Hard to say but I do like Sci Fi and comedies best. I like star wars, lord of the rings, aliens, terminator, die, or any chris Farley movie.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: Have you seen Home Alone?
user1: Do you like Macauley Culkin?
user1: Do you like Joe Pesci?
user2: hi, yes, i've seen home alone. how about you?
user1: yup
user1: it was funny
user2: which character you liked the most?
user1: the burglars
user1: not the kid so much
user2: why not?
user1: too cute
user1: too white in a way
user1: not to be racist
user1: I'm white
user1: but the kid bugs me
user1: did you like the movie?
user2: haha, i guess. the whole plot was kind off way out there for me
user1: yeah
user1: hard to believe parents would forget their kid
user1: I forgot John Hughes did this.
user2: right. but it was a good movie to see it with kids, mine seem to enjoy it
user1: wait
user1: I guess John Hughes wrote it
user1: Christopher c. directed
user2: i forgot that macaulay culkin was suppose to be 8 in that movie
user2: and that it was in released in 1990, seems like it was more recent
user1: ya know, if we maintained a dialogue, we could finish in 2 or 3 minutes
user2: so we are just suppose to talk about the movie?
user2: right?
user1: yup
user1: the documents too
user1: get info from the docs
user1: movie was made in 1990, so long ago
user2: OK. so now i recall the mom just remembers in the plane 
user1: yeah
user1: I remember that scene
user1: I can't remember who the dad was
user2: that's crazy, anytime i travel with kid they are the first thng i'm always paying attention to
user2: no wonder i'ts a comedy 
user1: they were all tied up with Christmas
user1: too busy to remember the child
user1: I think there was an older sibling
user1: can't remember
user2: yeah, BuZZ thebrother
user1: seemed like it was an actor I recognized
user2: the brother
user1: Buzz?
user1: really?
user2: yeah
user2: he's the one that got him in trouble
user1: okay, click Finish Conv and you'll get your code
user2: i don't know where is he from

conversation:
user2: Yo wats the movie
user2: Yo 
user2: Hey what's the movie
user2: Yo
user1: The movie is Home Alone. Have you seen it?
user2: Naw
user2: What kind of question is that
user2: Tell me your summations
user1: It's a great film with an all-star cast.  The fact that you haven't seen it and the fact that you say Naw leads me to believe you live under a rock.  
user2: Naw dats not me doc
user2: You wanna fight
user1: The first half of the film is flat and unsurprising.  The second half half is filled with humor and comedy.
user2: Yea but did you know which movie has the shower scene you filthy animal
user1: No fighting, but I would like to tell you that the traps used in the movie are just like Rube Goldberg machines.
user2: You filthy animal
user2: You just reading or u wanna talk
user2: Here grab this doorknob
user2: Bzzzzzt haha
user1: Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. But back to the original home Alone, it stars the now not so famous child star Macaulay Culkin as well as Joe Pesci
user2: Who else has directed
user1: "sadistic festival of adult-bashing"
user1: The director is the one who "discovered" America, Christopher Columbus ;)
user1: Do you like movies in the same genre as Home Alone?
user1: reading now?

conversation:
user1: Do you remember the movie Home Alone? It's almost 30 years old now.
user2: Yes, I do.
user1: I agree with the critics that it started out rather flat, then became slapstick and funny in the last half.
user2: It’s a 1990 American comedy film starring Macaulay Culkin and directed by Christ Columbus.
user1: Yes. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were in it, too.
user2: So was John Heard, playing the role
user1: He did a great job as Kevin's father.
user1: The critic found the booby traps to be implausible, though, and I have to say I agree. 
user2: Me too. I did think they were funny, though.
user1: Definitely. It's a good movie to watch if you're looking for something sadistic and slapstick.
user2: Another called it a “sadistic festival of adult-bashing”.
user2: John Hughes is pulling our strings as though he’d never learn to do anything else.
user1: I never liked the way Kevin was sent to the third floor after fighting with Buzz. I didn't blame him for wishing his family would disappear.
user2: I’ll bet he regretted in when burglars came in!
user1: But before that, he was left behind when everyone slept in.
user2: During the night, a heavy storm and power outage resets the family’s alarm clocks. In the morning, they are in a big rush and leave Kevin behind by mistake in all the confusion!
user2: Yes.
user1: That was a bad night for a storm.
user2: Very bad!
user1: One of the most enduring images from the film is when his mother figures out that he isn't on the plane and yells his name.
user1: Everything she went through trying to get back home was crazy.

user1: Hello ;)
user2: Hey
user1: Have You seen any good movies recently ?
user2: I've watched Home Alone lately
user2: Its a nice movie about a boy who is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris.
user1: Who is playing in it ?
user2: Macaulay Culkin
user1: ohh that kid...  
user2: You should watch it its good for all ages
user1: Did You enjoyed it ?
user2: Yes, it was full of a lot of adventures like for example he fought off robbers
user2: He set up traps for the robbers and all of them worked
user1: ...it's one of those "Christmas movies" right ?
user2: Yeah its a feel good Christmas movie
user1: What was the thing You liked the best about this movie ?
user2: I liked the fact that its based in the 90's. I'm a 90's kid so I love that
user1: I'm from early 80s, but yeah, I like 90s movies. Maybe I'll watch it. Any more celebrities in that movie ?
user2: Joe Pesci is in it
user1: Oh yeah ! I love Joe Pesci ! Cousin Vinny ! ;)
user2: Yeah, I love that movie too
user1: How is the rating of that movie ? Any good ?
user2: I think it received a 63/100 but I never trust these scores, its all based on personal taste 
user1: I totally agree - those "rating people" don't know what they're talking about
user2: Yeah, most of the time they're wrong
user1: There were more parts about this movie right ?
user2: Yes I think there was like 6 I'm not sure
user1: wow, which part are talking about in here ? ;)
user2: part 1, the first one, the original and classic
user1: Do You think it's the best one ?
user2: I believe it is as with everyone the original is best!
user1: I will give it a shot then, thank You
user2: No problem
user1: nice talking to You!
user2: Same
user1: bb
user2: Have a good one

conversation:
user2: Hi! I love the movie "Home Alone" I think Macaulay Caulkin is my favorite child actor!
user1: Hey
user2: What do you think about "Home Alone?"
user1: I think I like it.
user1: It sounds like a good holiday movie, a bit old though!
user1: What do you think?
user2: I agree. I do think it starts out rather slowly but then ramps up with lots of action scenes.
user2: It's still good despite its age.
user1: Yes! what is surprising me is how is a boy left behind by his family like wouldn't you notice before flying that someone is missing!
user2: You would think so but I guess when you're so overwhelmed with other family.
user2: Or more likely it's just the sort of fantasy every kid has - With the horror of the crooks trying to break in all night.
user1: I guess yeah. I was wondering what happens in the end? Do you know?
user1: hahaha. Sounds like Freud to me! but it is making me question how realistic the movie is. Especially the Critical Response
user2: Kevin's family comes home and they all reunite on Christmas. How satisfying.
user1: At least the ending is good!!
user2: Lol I doubt if there's any realism to the movie at all honestly.
user2: I think the most realistic thing is that it features live humans and not cartoon characters.
user1: yeah that is what I was thinking! At least they didn't put a random robot helping the kid
user1: weird reference but I have been watching many sci-fi movies lately for my comparative literature class.
user2: That would be hilarious honestly!
user2: I bet if tit had come out a few years later he would have been all high tech with computer aided traps.
user1: Oh about the key scene number 1.
user1: Sound like bullying to me!
user1: Do you have access to the key scenes document?
user2: Yes I see it.
user2: If I remember Kevin wasn't the most popular kid in his family. He got into quite a bit of trouble. Though he was a prankster.
user2: I suppose that feeds into the childhood fantasy as well.
user1: Fantasy or frustration! Who knows
user2: Frustration comes in once the fantasy wears off.
user2: How many kids that age could survive on their own for a few days?
user1: I think he was frustrated with all this bullying and then took it out as a prankster. Got dopamine boost from pranking and also irritated others
user1: That is what I am thinking! I never had to be alone when I was ~8. 
user2: Yeah I mean who isn't frustrated with their place in life especially at that stage of life.
user2: I'm trying to remember when I was first left alone... It all feels so long ago now!
user1: yeah. oh yes, I still remember the frustrations I felt with my fellow siblings and how I took them out by pranking or irritating them with certain acts
user1: I knowwww!! I always has younger and older siblings around so was not left alone at all except for when I went to a summer camp at university but I still other unfamiliar people around me
user2: I'm an only child personally so I never got to experience that joy. I've always kind of wanted siblings it feels like I would automatically have a friend always. But I think that's not how it really works out often.
user2: Once I was left on my own I had plenty of time on my own. But my dad owned a business right across the street so he could be home in minutes if something happened.
user1: well you grow  up to be friends. like as a child, you would have a lot of issues with each other, with stationary, books, notebooks, bookpacks, like all the small stuff but as you grow old, you start to value them more and understand each other better.
user1: haha so you had the security!! I have not been alone alone but I do remember time when I was a kid and everyone would take nap in the afternoon of summers and I would be outside all alone, biking, or climbing trees and all that kind of stuff
user2: My one real direct experience is that my mom doesn't get along with her brother at all...
user2: That sounds like so much fun! I'd be paranoid of getting in trouble if I was doing something I wasn't supposed to so I'd pretty much follow the rules all the time even if there was virtually no chance of getting caught.
user1: oh I guess that might have made you careful
user1: about hanging out with siblings or getting close to them
user2: I suppose so. Though on my dad's side he gets along great with his family. But they live so far away so I still really had no relationship with them.
user1: I got into a lot of trouble as a child but I guess that is how you grow.
user1: Yeah same. I am not close to many of my cousins but I am very close to ones I am in contact with and then I have my siblings who are so cute and cooool
user2: Yeah i think it's good for you to get in some trouble. Being the good kids gets you largely ignored. I never got in trouble so I never needed much of anything. I think it's a good lesson for the adult working world at least. It took me so much longer to learn that than I feel like my peers did.
user2: I do keep in touch with some of my relatives online. And I feel close on the occasions I actually see them. But with such a distance and with such infrequent visits it's hard to really feel very close.
user1: Yes i was left more open to discover the world on my own.
user2: I've always been somewhat jealous of those sort of kids seeing them in movies.
user1: I have fallen from bikes that have knocked the breath out of me. I have also climbed trees and sometimes even jumped from them. I have raced my siblings on swings to see who gets the highest the fastest. So it was all part of that that made me confident in what I was doing.
user1: Yeah, definitely, it is very hard to keep in touch with distant family members and even friends. Unless you share a lot of common things or activities, you would lose interest in each other's life and would be forced to move on.
user2: I'm personally from NYC. It's true that it's a concrete jungle. Sure I could get around by myself at a very young age there's very little nature there. Central Park isn't the same as having a back yard.
user1: Oh Of course. THAT is NICEEE! I love NYC!!  Although I miss nature but I love the tall buildings and the diversity I always find whenever I visit.
user1: I do agree that you would need a retreat from all the hustle and bustle more often than not.
user2: I do find it interesting to see what's going on in their lives on Facebook. But it's not like we really have much of anything to talk about.
user2: Thank you :) It's quite a different way of growing up than what I think the majority of the country experiences. I love the city and dealing with all of its issues. While living out in the country does sound nice and idyllic I don't think it's something I'd really be able to handle long term. It's just too quiet and monotonous.
user1: Yeah I know! It also depends on the nature of the person, like how the kid was all on his own without his parents and did just fine. even attempted to set up traps for burglars.
user2: I took the train up to Toronto last year after Thanksgiving. I loved the beautiful views of the Hudson all the way up. I do have to say that it's so odd realizing that somehow I'm still really in New York.
user2: I'm willing to bet that most 8 year olds wouldn't be able to defeat two burglars on their own no matter where they're living.
user2: If the movie came out now I bet the parents would have some smart phone app that stalls the burgulars so the kid doesn't even have to do anything except call 911 and that would be the whole thing
user1: yeah I know!!
user1: well they would not be able to do it now because the kids are invested in ipads and tablets so much taht they have no working knowledge of life
user2: It would be pretty funny if somebody made a parody movie where that happened.
user1: I know. but it would be more of a sad futuristic movie
user2: At one point smart phones were completely unrealistic.
user2: It's so hard to believe how fast technology has changed.
user1: yeah. They could've contacted the kid on his phone or ipad when they figured he was missing but guess that wasn't an option back then!
user2: Well I think the burglars cut the phone line. Today they'd have to disable the wifi.
user1: hahaha they still have cellular data!
user2: imagine if they cut the wifi and then the kid just lets them walk in because they said they came to fix it.
user1: OMG
user1: I can totally imagine that happening!
user2: lol yeah I really wish that scenario seemed less realistic.
user1: I know but this is the world we live in now lol
user1: What do you think about this movie overall though? 
user2: True. I waited forever to get a smart phone and only finally updated to a decent smart phone two years ago. Now it's funny that I honestly can't imagine not having one.
user2: It was pretty entertaining overall. I think I found it a bit too violent though. I never could really get into that cartoony sort of violence. It just makes me think how much pain everyone must be in.
user1: I mean I understand the trouble and feelings mom had when she realized her son was missing but I think the son enjoyed it a bit too much
user1: By trapping the burglars and taking them to a neighboring vacant home
user1: and who informed the police that Harry and Marv were in that specific house!

conversation:
user2: Hi, the movie is Home Alone starring Mcaulay Culkin. The plot is about a boy who accidentally got left behind at Christmas when his family went to Paris.
user1: Did you find the movie funny?
user2: I loved it. Did you?
user1: Yes, I have seem all of the home alone movies.  The first one is the funniest.
user1: what would you rate it out of 5 stars?
user2: I agree.  It's like most movies the first one is always the best and they try to keep it going but it doesn't usually work.  Definitely, 5 stars
user1: Did you find the movie too long, too short or just the right length?
user2: I thought it was perfect.
user2: What about you?
user1: Rotten tomatoes has given it a 69% on the tomato meter.  Do you think it deserves that? 
user2: I thought it said 62 percent.  I don't really understand their scoring
user1: you are right, 62 percent. My error.  IMDB gave it 7.5/10.  That's for 369,089 votes.  Do you think that is more accurate rating?
user2: I think it deserves a higher rating
user1: Higher rating than 7.5?  
user2: I feel it deserves at least a 9.
user1: Who is the funniest actor in the film in your opinion?
user2: It was a great movie for the entire family.  My children watched it over and over again and laughed each and every time.  They loved it that much
user2: I love Joe Pesci
user1: He's a very funny actor.  
user2: His character made it funnier to me
user1: Do you think this movie can be watched any time or mostly during the christmas holidays?
user2: Who do you think was the funniest?
user1: The two burglars were the funniest
user2: I think it's great anytime not just Christmas
user1: Do you prefer watching movies in the theatre or at home?
user2: Did you feel it believable though that a mother would actually forget her child?
user2: Depends on the movie
user1: well they did have a lot of kids but no, a mother would never forget their child.
user2: I agree. I have four and I never forgot mine
user1: I guess it happens but that's rather wreckless parenting.
user1: Have you seen the other 3 home alone movies?
user2: As far as watching movies at home or in the theater, Star Wars and space movies are better in theaters 
user2: Yes I saw all of them
user2: I remember the first one the best though
user1: yes for sure re. scifi.
user2: Home Alone is a movie that I would prefer to watch at home.  It doesn't have the scenery for a theater

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi! 
user1: this movie is like a classic now
user2: How are you tofay?
user2: Forrest Gump?
user1: mine shows home alone
user1: i am good today
user2: Oh I don’t have anything
user1: Does your docs say forrest gump? or do u not have the docs today at all?
user1: ohhhh!!  i see 
user2: But yeah for sure a staple around the holidays?
user1: yes a very good staple.  i remember as a kid it being one of my faves
user1: it came out in 1990. hard to beleive
user2: Hahah I don’t have a doc I was just thinking of classic movies 
user1: lol i forgot that sometimes  ppl dont have them lol
user2: I love home alone! I am the youngest of a big family so I always identified with him 
user1: Very low ratings on this movie. rotten tomatoes giave it a 5, metacritic a 63/100 
user2: I was especially jealous when he go the large pizza to himself 
user1: Cinema score was an A though
user2: Really? 
user1: hahaha i bet so!  i wouldn't mind being home alone in that big old house he had lol
user2: I would have though you would have gotten high ratings 
user1: i liked when he made the "party" 
user2: That was awesome! 
user1: ikr!  those rotten tomatoes tho are sooo hard on movies and rips them to shreds i feel like
user1: i think if this story were to happen in real life the mom would been arrested problably
user2: I think people only give reviews if they have something bad to say about it 
user1: right that is true.  
user1: maybe dont take the time to report good stuff but bad stuff
user2: Well at least today they could have FaceTimed him 
user2: And probably watched on cameras 
user1: hahha right and these days he probably would have had a cell phone at that age lol
user1: and could just call his mom on her phone lol.   she was fighting over that pay phone at one point at the airport
user1: it's funny tho that in the 90's that was how we lived.  we didn't have phones lol
user2: He could just take an Uber lol 
user1: lol
user2: Those were the days 
user1: its funny how that was the norm
user2: Now everyone has a cell phone 
user1: and now wow look at the world. it's so more advanced. 
user2: And is low key addicted 
user2: It’s crazy 
user2: How garb it has advanced in such a short amount of time 
user1: yep- and the burgurlars at that point, they weren't going to steal electronics bc there were no computers LOL just jewelry and fine china hahaha
user2: Wow 

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: I like the second half of the movie where Kevin starts getting back at the robbers.
user1: I found the entire movie enjoyable.
user1: I did not understand some of the criticism.
user2: John Hughes was a great director.
user1: Especially about the elaborate booby traps.
user1: John Hughes was the producer.
user1: I wonder if he wrote the movie.
user1: oh, he did
user2: I agreed that the traps were too elaborate. It did make the kid unrelatable.
user1: I never really paid attention to that detail
user1: i liked the christmas motif more than the traps
user2: That detail was present throughout the film.
user2: I forgot it was Christmas. That was played down.
user1: i think it started at thanksgiving
user1: I do not remember the power lines
user2: It started right before his family left.
user1: rooten tomatoes gave it a low score
user1: metacritic too
user2: That's actually a good score for rotten tomatoes.
user2: Daniel Stern was pretty funny as Marv.
user1: buzz was a jerk
user1: I think Gus was played by John Candy
user2: I for got that the mom had to ride in the box truck withthe polka band.
user1: This was my least favorite part of the movie.
user2: I thought it humanized the mother, which was hard to get people to relate to her because she  left her kid behind
user1: i didnt like her until i saw the movie years later
user2: I don't think most people liked her until she got home ands was proud of Kevin.
user2: I forgot that they had flooded the houses. 
user1: This section was kind of scary
user1: the old man did not make it less scary
user1: flooding was their signature
user1: wet bandits
user2: When Marley came and saved him?  It was assumed that Marley wasn't the bad guy by that point.
user2: I always wondered what happened to Buzz's spider.
user1: the family got home fast
user2: They only had to wait an extra day after the mother left.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello!
user1: Have you seen the movie Home Alone?
user2: I have before, it is a good movie. I am surprised that it scored as low as it did on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic
user2: It seems like the adults that watched the film did not find it that funny since the document says that critical responses said that it was a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing"
user1: hwllo
user2: It seems like a movie that seems funny enough though. It seems a little critical though I think
user1: It did score somewhat low
user1: But the actos are great
user1: Joe Pesci
user2: That surprised me that it scored low
user1: and Macaulay Culkin
user2: Do you think that Culkin does a good job acting as Kevin dealing with his cousins and siblings?
user1: Yes he does an amazing job!
user1: I can't believe it came out so long ago- almost 20 years!
user1: He's good in recent movies too
user1: although I don't remember the names.
user2: It doesn't feel like it's been 20 years since this movie has come out haha. I guess I just feel old. 
user1: I know- me too. I watched that movie as a child
user2: I wonder if Columbus would change anything about the movie if he had the chance today?
user1: Maybe, but also it's such a notable movie , i feel like the viewer wouldn't want any changes
user1: I didn't realize they left to spend christmas in Paris
user1: I thought it was NYC the family travelled to
user2: Between that scene and the next scene, I feel really bad for the family. Talk about bad luck, not a fun way to spend your Christmas
user1: oh not fun at all! 
user1: It's so funny
user2: I find it hilarious because that is about as good as my luck is
user1: the part that scared me when I was little were when the two burglers got into the home
user1: but it ended up being a comedy 
user1: didn't realiize the genre was comedy when I first watched
user2: I find it funny that they "mistakingly left him at home". I guess with bigger families, it is hard to keep track of all of your kids at once!
user2: I can relate to Harry and Marv here. I am clumsy and seem to get injured rather...easy per se 
user1: Hahaha me too! I don't think I would be smart enough to set up all the traps though!
user2: I don't think I would either. I would set up simple ones then just be waiting with like a gun or something. Kevin goes out and beyond what any normal person would do o_0
user1: Oh absolutely!
user1: It's super weird
user1: He was SUCH A smart child
user2: But super funny too
user1: Where did they live?
user1: Chicago?
user2: I believe that's what the document said. If I remember correctly, Chicago is where they live. And they can't get back home because of the cancelations and delays
user1: oh damn
user1: I hear Chicago is so busy during the holidays
user1: I didn't realize the power went out because winds knocked them out too
user1: I really forgot a lot of details from the movie!
user1: It was so long ago I watched
user2: I've never been there during aholiday, but the movie made it seem super busy
user1: OH yeah! No surprise it took them so long to get home
user1: Lol funny kevin wished his parents would disappear 
user1: and then they did
user2: At least Kevin wasn't bored during the holiday
user1: lmaoo I would have been so sad home alone
user1: I hear the critical responses are so mean
user2: I feel for Kevin still not having his family on Christmas
user2: I don't understand why though
user1: some of them are nice and promote the movie, but others dont justify how great it is
user1: Yeah me neither
user2: Well, it was fun discussing childhood memories of movies with you!
user1: Same here, see you next time!

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: Wow there is a lot here about Home Alone that I didn't know
user2: Hello dude
user1: Do you know what to do here?
user2: I used to know it was directed by Columbus
user2: But I never finished seeing it once
user1: really? Its been a christmas classic for a long time
user2: I can't believe it's as old as 1990
user1: No I can I was born in 1991
user1: and I remember when I first saw it
user1: How smart was kevin in the movie?
user2: The rating seems to be quite good what do you think?
user1: was he smarter than typical 8-year olds?
user1: The rating on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic is lower than what I'd expect
user1: anyhow we have to talk about the first scene
user1: when they're all getting ready to go on the trip to paris
user1: do you remember the robber was there dressed up like a police man
user2: It is a comedy movie I never get tired of 
user1: the robber was scouting houses as a police officer and that's pretty brazen
user1: also how did the electricity knock out and the family not feel super cold
user1: cuz the thermostat shouldve been connected to the power lines
user1: and the older cousin girl counted the neighbor as a cousin 
user1: it was an interesting beginning to a movie for sure
user2: So Kevin fought his elder brother before the trip to paris
user1: well not really, it was a little rough housing
user1: he couldn't handle his cheese pizza being all eaten
user2: But he got punished and was left behind accidentally in the process
user2: I guess he was happy to be home alone before the burglars showed uo
user1: Wow that second key scene i cant remember that well
user1: kate travelled with the polka band?
user1: I guess I was too excited seeing Kevin I didn't focus on the mom as much
user1: maybe a mom would have a different perspective when viewing the movie
user1: do i still get paid?
