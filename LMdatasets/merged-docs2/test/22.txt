description:
Sixteen-year-old homeschooled Cady Heron and her zoologist parents return to the United States after a twelve-year research trip in Africa, settling down in Evanston, Illinois. Attending a public school for the first time, Cady meets new classmates Janis Ian and Damian Leigh. Janis and Damian educate Cady on the school's various cliques and warn her to avoid the most popular and infamous one, the 'Plastics', who are led by queen bee Regina George and include insecure rich girl Gretchen Wieners and sweet but dimwitted Karen Smith. The Plastics take an interest in Cady, and invite her to sit with them at lunch. Seeing that Cady is getting along with the Plastics, Janis hatches a plan of revenge against Regina for some past slight, using Cady as the infiltrator. 
When Regina is finally made aware of Cady's treachery, she retaliates by spreading the contents of her Burn Book all over the school, quickly inciting a massive brawl. To avoid suspicion, Regina inserts a fake libel of herself in the book in order to blame Cady, Gretchen, and Karen, the only female students not mentioned in the book. Karen convinces Principal Duvall that they did not spread the book. Duvall soon quells the fighting, and gathers all the girls in the school in the gymnasium. Math teacher Ms. Norbury, whom the Burn Book defamed as a drug dealer, makes the girls face the ways they all treat each other, confess their transgressions, and apologize to each other and the teachers. When Janis's turn comes, she defies Norbury and confesses her plan to destroy Regina with Cady's help, and openly mocks Regina with the support of the entire school. Pursued by an apologetic Cady, Regina storms out and is struck by a school bus, breaking her spine. 
Without any friends, shunned by Aaron, grounded by her parents and despised by her peers at school, Cady takes full blame for the Burn Book and becomes an outcast. After she makes amends with Regina, Cady's guilt soon dissolves and she returns to her old personality. As part of her punishment for lying and failing Ms. Norbury's class, she joins the Mathletes in the state championship finals, and ends up winning the competition for her team after her opponent answers incorrectly. At the Spring Fling dance, Regina's new boyfriend, Shane Oman, is elected King, while Cady is elected Queen. Onstage, Cady declares that all her classmates are wonderful in their own way, breaks her plastic tiara, and distributes the pieces to some other girls. She then reconciles with Janis, Damian, and Aaron, and reaches a truce with the Plastics. 

conversation:
user1: ah mean girls. such a funny movie. have you seen it? 
user2: Yeah, even though I love comedies, this wasn't 1 of my faves
user1: how come. thought tina fey's writing was fantastic in it. she did an amazing job adapting a self help book
user2: I loved the story & how true they made it in how  teen girls act but I honestly don't know why I didn't rate it highly as all the right ingredients were there. I cannot believe it was 2004 it was released though, 14 years ago!
user1: I see. i didn't realize it was 14 years ago. you're right. Man. now I feel old. i remember seeing this in the theaters. i guess you disagree that it's one of top 50 teen comedies, at least according to rotten tomatoes
user2: I suppose it's just all about personal preference, my favourite American comedy films include anything with Will Ferrol & Seth Rogan so more slapstick films. I'm sure this was the movie that made Lindsay Lohan huge even though she had starred in movies from her early years
user1: This was one of lindsay lohan's bigger successes. it made her very well known. although i think it made amanda seyfried well known too. she was so pretty in this film. it made a fan out of me.
user2: Well I'm glad it was as big as it was as the message it sent out to teenage girls hopefully got through to some because high school days are stressful enough to be worrying about why you are/aren't in a clique. It's good to be different!
user1: sure. That's the point of the self help book. For girls high school can be pretty tough and the movie makes it light of that andat the same time turns it into silly self examination of how kids behave. it's not without a basis that rolling stones called a comic gold. 
user2: I can still remember the pressure of that stage in life and it was a long time ago although my daughter is nearly 13 so I;m trying to make sure she has the self confidence to not feel the need to follow the in crowd as the damage it can do to teenage girls can be very serious
user1: it's funny how the character was home schooled because her parents were zoologists working in africa. no wonder she had to be educated on the clicks in the beginning of the movie. 
user2: Makes hoe schooling very appealing. I love how the 'mean girls' are known as the plastics, all fake
user1: yeah, that's the part of genius writing on tina fey's part. she's really one of the most talented comedians of our time, in my opinion
user2: Very clever woman. It def stood out from all the other American teen movies that were so popular around that time
user1: yeah. more often than not, teen comedies tend to be slap stick type. this was a lot more cerebral. i wonder if the actress who played regina did any more movies. she was fantastic in the movie 
user2: Same with the director, Mark Waters. I cannot think of any other movies he directed but surely he must have made more successful films
user1: yeah can't recall any of his other movies. amanda seyfried did pretty well after the mean girls though 
user2: It;s not very often a movie gets a CinemaScore A and I'm glad it did as it sent out a very positive message
user1: I usually don't trust those scores so much. i tend to go with viewer ratings instead of critics ratings. people have better tastes than critics. 
user2: Yeah I agree especially about Rotten Tomatoes, I've really enjoyed movies before that if having read the reviews beforehand would have maybe put me off & resulted in me missing a good movie!
user1: yeah and critics have certain snob appeal. they tend to like movies that are artsy, although it's not all that entertaining. personally i prefer to be entertained. i mean i like some snobbish movies, but still
user2: I'm really interested to find out the where exactly this film came within the top 50 result of teen comedies
user1: huh. that's a good question. i don't know that either. i'd say pretty high probably in the top 10. 
user1: hello you there? 
user2: I will be finding out soon lol. I am going to guess that American Pie being no1.. I love the irony of Cady breaking the plastic crown at the end 
user1: american pie is the classic slap stick teen comedy. and it was good. anyway. that's all for me 
user2: Yeah me too, was great talking to you. Take care :)
user1: how do we submit the task?
user2: This is my 1st time! Urs too?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi, I just saw a movie
user2: Oh what movie?
user1: Mean Girls starring Lindsay Lohan
user2: Was it good?
user1: Well, I love High School movies for some reason. But this was exceptional. 
user2: So it was a comedy?
user2: Did it win any awards?
user1: Yeah. Hilarious. It was written by Tina Fey, not to be mistaken for Sarah Palin.
user2: Oh I love comedies, who else was in the movie?
user1: i didn't recognize anyone else. Lindsay's always in the news, so I know her. 
user2: Yeah she's in a lot of good movies
user1: I dunno about awards, but I read that the critics loved it.
user2: Nice, I'm looking for a good movie to watch, do you recommend this one?
user1: Yeah, but she's also famous for real life stuff...wild personal life. Sounds like she'll be POTUS one day
user1: I'd recommend it. Besides being a teen movie, its a great conversational flick
user2: she seems just like all the other young actresses
user2: so is it suitable to watch with children do you think?
user2: or do you think it'd be better for a date night movie
user1: There's some dark comedy involved. At one point, one of the Mean Girls is struck by a bus. So more date night than family one. 
user2: oh that sounds traumatic
user2: are there any scary parts?
user2: i'm a total wuss
user1: Regarding awards, it is listed by Rotten Tomatoes as one of the Top 50 Teen Comedies.
user1: No scary parts. Don't worry.
user2: wow so it should be a good time then
user2: is there anything else i should know?
user2: i'm not a fan of gross out humor
user1: Yeah, its an intelligent take on the genre. Seems to kinda make fun of it too...ends with the Prom...though not like Carrie fyi, since ur a self-described wuss.
user1: No, no gross-out humor. 
user1: Here's what's interesting. It was based on a non-fiction book
user2: oh i love movies based on books
user1: It was based on a book that studied social cliques in high school and their psychological effects on girls. So Tina Fey took that and made it into a comedy. Very unique. 
user2: sounds interesting

conversation:
user1: Hi there!
user2: Hi!
user1: So you have any movie in mind? :)
user2: So Mean Girls is the film
user2: 84% rotten tomatoes 6.9/10
user1: Mean girls? I have watch that before and it was back when Lindsay Lohan was good.
user2: Yes like 14 years ago!
user1: What makes you think I should rewatch it again my friend?
user1: Yes, its crazy!
user2: A reminder of Lindsay being good lol
user1: She was very hot at the time.
user2: I like that she transitioned from being home schooled to public school
user2: haha!
user1: Yeah, I forgot about that part.
user2: Kind of reminds me of me
user1: I only remember their dance, the Christmas dance, that was hot.
user2: I moved and started high school like her
user2: Yeah, I agree
user1: Ohh so was it tough?
user1: Just like in the movie?
user1: LOL
user2: Just starting at a new high school, being an outsider
user2: I liked her group of friends even though they were mena
user2: mean
user1: Ohh okay, I can relate being an outsider.
user2: The Plastics
user1: For sure I mean if they werent mean, the movie wouldnt happen...
user2: Oh and her crush!
user1: What's that? A movie?
user2: Shane
user2: The mean girls were called the plastics
user1: Ohh I forgot about him, all I can remember are the girls, lol.
user2: Lol
user2: I'd watch it just for that scene
user1: The christmas dance? :D
user2: Yes!
user2: wouldn't you?
user1: Lol, I think we could be best friends just you saying that.
user2: lol!
user1: I would, always lol, that was cute and hot at the same time.
user2: Typical high school stuff though
user1: Yeah, its not really about making a compelling story but I guess the movie just wants you to have fun.

conversation:
user1: I can’t seem to see what the movie is
user2: I can. Its a teen comedy with Lindsay Lohan called "Mean Girls"
user2: Got good reviews on rotten tomatoes but a poor score on Metacritic
user2: Genre not really my cup of tea.
user2: you there?
user2: hello hello hello is anybody out there?
user2: im aborting conversation in 5 minutes
user2: 3 min
user2: aborting

conversation:
user2: Hi@
user1: Hi. Can you tell me the name of the movie?
user2: It's Mean Girls.
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: No I have not. Is it about girls?
user2: Yes. And those girls are mean
user2: It's a 2004 film that is an American teen comedy film written by Tina Fey
user1: Do you know the rating of the movie?
user2: What I know is that Rotten Tomatoes named it in its "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies".
user2: So it was received pretty well.
user1: Is it something you could take a child to see?
user2: I guess it depends on your style of parenting and how old they are. The movie does have sexual references and (I think) cursing. 
user2: But that's to be expected in a teen comedy film.
user1: Do you know if it won any major awards?
user2: It was praised as being "comic gold".
user1: That sounds pretty good. Do you know if Tina Fey has written any other movies?
user2: I'm not sure but she has been highly praised for this film. Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron was the main character.
user1: I don't want to get bored. Do you know how long the movie is?
user2: The movie is pretty long but just a normal length.

conversation:
user2: Have you seen mean girls
user1: No, but I'm interested in it. 
user1: What's it about?
user2: Its really good. Its a high school movie about a new girl entering a school that is run by a group of mean girls
user2: its a comedy
user1: It sounds pretty good.
user1: What actors are in it?
user2: Its probably lindsey lohans best movie
user2: also has rachel mcadams and amanda seyfried
user1: Wow, that's a lot of good actresses
user1: I think I remember Tina Fey being in that one too.
user1: Also Tim Meadows.
user2: Yeah its a goof cast
user1: When did it come out?
user2: good*
user2: it came out in 2004
user2: its a solid movie
user1: Wow I can't believe it's been 14 years since it came out
user1: That's bananas
user2: Yeah its gone by fast it seems like
user1: How long is the movie, if I decided to watch it?
user2: its a little under 2 hours
user2: its an easy watch
user1: Oh, that's good.
user1: Did they ever make a sequel?
user2: they did not
user2: it was a one off
user1: Well, I will have to check it out then
user1: Do you think it's on Netflix?
user2: You should
user2:  I am sure its on a streaming service somewhere
user1: Awesome, I'll look it up!
user1: Thank you! Nice talking to you!

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hi
user2: Hi
user2: Have you seen the movie mean girls ?
user1: we are supposed to speak about "MEAN GIRLS" ?
user1: yes
user2: Yes me too 
user2: It s comedy and a fun romance 
user1: yeap
user2: It was highly praised by the critics 
user1: yeap, but in my opinion
user2: It was named the fifty greatest teen comedies 
user2: My favorite part was the girls hating on each other 
user1: it is too much viewed
user1: I liked it too
user1: ^^
user2: Rotten tomatoes gave it 84 percent so it seems it could have been hated and liked as well 
user1: but too many movies like it are made
user1: even if it is correct
user2: I think Lindsey Lohan who plays candy is a good actress in this 
user1: Do you often watch this kind of movie ?
user2: Mean girls is similar to most favorite teen shows.  Rachael madams iplays Regina George 
user1: exactly
user2: Amanda seyfriend plays Karen he role was more quiet 
user1: that is what I think
user2: What’s interesting is this was a non fiction book 
user2: It got a score of 66/100 which is not wonderful either 
user1: that is the mark I would have given
user2: The burn book was an interesting concept 
user2: The cinema score was a a - 

conversation:
user2: Hey
user2: I had no idea this movie was actually based on a self-help book
user1: Hi. Oh wow. That is an interesting fact
user2: yeah
user2: love this movie lol. i've watched it so many times, it never gets old.
user2: the social commentary is too funny
user1: Well not a big fan of Lindsay Lohan but I think the movie was fun
user2: Love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
user1: I can't believe this movie is already over a decade old though. Yeah Tina Fey wrote the screenplay but not sure what Amy Poehler did?
user2: Yeah it's so crazy haha. makes you feel old
user2: Amy Poehler was Regina George's mom
user1: The document doesn't say this so I can't be sure
user1: Quite decent ratings and reviews! 
user2: yeah she's not a main character
user2: yeah definitely
user1: (we shouldn't talk about anything not mentioned in the document)
user2: oh yeah. 
user2: i thought that would be relevant to the movie haha but yeah let's be safe
user2: Scene 1 is hilarious
user2: The descriptions of the Plastics are really funny
user1: That was funny the "plastics"
user1: And the queen bee Regina George. Haha. 
user2: haha
user2: The wording of scene 2 is funny as well. I like how they wrote this, it captures the essence of the movie.
user1: So much drama between high school girls. Well it's not unusual high school students have drama but they kicked it up a notch 
user2: Haha yeah definitely
user2: It seems so silly which makes it funny
user2: satirical
user2: I think it's so funny that Regina casually breaks her spine and is hit by a bus
user1: Well the principal.. When I was watching the movie, I felt for him.. don't wanna be in his position
user2: Hahah yeah definitely
user2: Ms. Norbury handled this well
user1: And Ms. Norbury and others... it must have been a headache
user2: I like that Cady becomes her old self again in scene 3
user2: It makes high school drama seem like a "phase"
user1: And here comes Aaron! Finally a boy enters the scene. Remember the tension when we watched?
user2: Haha yeah!
user2: I'm proud of her for reconciling with her friends and becoming elected Prom Queen, which shows her character development
user1: Yes. Very nice of her.
user1: Nice touch when she said "her classmates are wonderful in their own way"
user1: I'd say that was very mature of her
user2: I agree. I love that she's promoting acceptance and tolerance.
user2: It's a nice way to end the film.
user2: I think we're done!
user1: Yes! thanks! it was nice talking to you

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello! How are you doing today>
user1: I’m doing great. Almost Friday
user2: Yep! Finally.
user2: So, I chose to talk about Mean Girls. Have you seen that movie?
user1: So what w talking about today?
user1: I have not any good?
user2: It is great! It's an older movie, made in 2004, but it is really funny.
user1: Cool. Who is in it?
user2: It's one of Lindsey Lohan's best movies, I think, but also stars Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried also play really funny parts.
user1: Wow. They must have been young?
user2: Yes, it was at the peak of a lot of their careers.
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: It's a funny premise because Lindsey plays the "new girl" who enrolls at a high school that has the common cliques: nerds, jocks, etc, and these popular girls that some of the outsiders call the "Plastics."
user1: Interesting. Is the movie long?
user2: Lindsey's character, Cady, has just moved from Africa, so the whole scene is a pretty big culture clash to her. She doesn't really understand it, but ends up being roped into a revenge plot by one of the outsiders.
user2: It's average movie length, around 2 hours.
user1: Sounds odd for Lohan
user1: If you have to rate how good from 1-10
user2: It sounds weird from what we know of her now, but she is really great in it.
user1: Like you said her peak
user1: So they are high schoolers?
user2: Right. And as the movie goes on, she moves from the innocent girl next door kind of character, to being involved in the popular girl group, and getting involved in a scandal involving a "Burn Book," which is one of those situations where the kids rate other students based on different characteristics. One of the girls ends up finding out about the revenge plot I mentioned earlier, and gets hit by a bus! Crazy stuff.
user1: You just told me the end lol
user1: I don’t need to watch it now 
user2: Yes, they are all juniors in high school. Tina Fey plays one of the teachers, and she wrote the screenplay.
user2: Oh no, that's not even the end!
user1: Really? Is must be good then 
user1: Twists and turns everywhere 
user2: I won't spoil all of it, but Lindsey's character ends up learning a lot about herself and the culture of the school, and I guess how to navigate it in a much better way than she does in the mid-point of the movie. 
user1: Well you got me
user1: Well you got me hooked. Gotta watch it

conversation:
user1: I absolutely love this movie! It is so funny and Lindsay Lohan is the perfect Cady Heron!
user2: Yes and it is very true to Queen Bees!
user2: It deserved more than %84 on Rotten Tomatos
user1: I never read the book Queen Bees and Wannabes. I also enjoy Tina Fey as the screenwriter she does an awesome job
user1: Yes I agree but rotten tomatoes is usually pretty strict in their reviews and do no favor comedies as much as other genres.
user1: I agree with Rotten Tomatoes that this movie is a "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies"
user2: Mark Waters did a great job directing.
user1: Yes he did a phenomenal job directing and the characters were casted perfectly.
user2: And Rachel McAdams was great as Regina George
user2: It is a great example of the comedy / teeny genre
user1: Peter Travers review was spot on I think this is "comic gold"
user1: yes the key scenes in this movie were very entertaining! I liked Janis and Damien a lot!
user1: They were trying to help Cady adjust to school in America
user1: I enjoyed Regina's character because she was really relatable to some girls in high school today
user2: It is understandable that someone who was homeschooled would feel bewildered when entering high school
user1: I usually look at Rotten Tomatoes critic score before watching a movie 
user1: Yes and someone who lived in Africa for the past 12 years
user2: Evanston, Illinois is very different from Africa
user1: Yes it is!
user1: Do you like movies from the comedy genre?
user2: The movie seems to have scored better on Cinema Score than the other two websites mentioned 
user1: Yes that is a keen observation. Like I mentioned earlier, I think it is harder for comedies to score as well.
user1: The scene where the Burn book is released to the school and the massive brawl ensues is hilarious! 
user2: Yes it is.
user2: It was suprising to see the Regina character break her spine in what I thought was going to be a light hearted comedy
user1: What did you think of the scene where Regina George gets hit by the bus and breaks her spine?
user1: Yes i thought it was a dream or imaginative but it was not and I was surprised by that
user2: I can't believe the math teacher was dealing drugs
user1: It took a great deal of courage for Cady to take blame for the burn book and become an outcast. What do you think of her actions?
user2: It's good she didn't just drop out of school 
user1: Yes that is true. She faced her problems instead of running away of them.
user2: Her performance at the math competition was impressive
user1: Yes very impressive and she wins the mathletes competition for her team!
user2: Yes this can't be easy. Illinois is a big state and there must be a lot of high schools in the competition
user1: What do you think of Cady and Shane Oman winning Queen and King at the Spring Fling dance?
user2: Another surprising turn of events
user2: What do you think about it?
user1: Yes it was very surprising but I think it was deserved.
user2: And she made a nice gesture by breaking her tiara 
user2: and distributing the pieces to the other girls
user1: Yes that was a great scene! In the end she reconciles with Janis, Damian, and Arron, and reaches a truce with the Plastics

conversation:
user2: Hey
user2: Have you ever seen Mean Girls?
user1: Hey, I cannot say that I have seen it from start to finish.
user2: Well it's a great comedy
user1: I do think it interesting that a movie about high school bullying is considered comical in light of what is taking place across the country.  What do you think?
user2: This movie came out in 2004, so it was a different time back then
user2: people weren't as sensitive.
user1: Yes, I suppose the students did not all have access to cell phones and social media as they do now.  Hey, I see that Tina Fey was the screenwriter?  Was this one of her first assignments?
user2: I'm not sure, but I know Lindsay Lohan is in it, lol
user1: I see that.  I am still surprised that this movie was ranked in the top 50 teen comedies in 2012? Why do you suppose that is/was?
user2: Because of the actors ans the plot of the movie, it was very entertaining
user2: an ti had some great reviews.
user1: Entertaining indeed.  I see that it has an almost all female line up which means that fashion and other female issued probably dominated the story line. Have you seen the movie?
user2: Yes I have, many times, it somewhat of a classic.
user1: So does the film address the benefits of a female high school clique?
user2: It address the awareness of high school cliques, but not in a positive light.
user1: Got it.  So what do you think the classification of "Plastics" really embodies?
user2: Resemblance or characteristics of a barbie doll, because their made from plastic, it could ask mean fake.
user2: also mean*
user1: Oh, I do get it now.  Is is me or does Hollywood continue to make films where the queen bee is always rich? and not middle, working or lower class? 
user2: Yea I agree, even today's show the queen be is still wealthy, soiled or fortunate.
user1: And I do get how Cady would respond positively to being accepting into the in group. However, what I dont
user1: don't get is what Janis is upset about?
user2: They just like drama
user2: I guess she wants to get even.
user1: Am I correct in assuming that the Burn Book is a book filled with lies and made up stories or is it a black book of past sins and transgression done by student and teachers?
user2: It's a book filled with lies and past sins
user1: It sounds like the scene in the gym was not fun or game - no comic moments but real serious stuff would you say
user2: Yes, it was a time to make a change and get everyone to get a long and forgive each other.
user1: Hey, up to this point except for the principle and male teachers, there have been no mention of any boy(s).  Who is this Aaron and how does he fit into the drama?
user2: I think are classmates.\
user1: So after Regina's hit by a bus Cady leaves the bee hive and returns to her old self; somewhat like Cinderella without a glass shoe - don't you think?
user2: I think it was a wake up call for her.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi, have you seen this movie?
user1: Which movie are we talking about>
user2: Mean Girls
user1: Hahahah, yeah I've seen Mean Girls
user1: a classic
user2: It is, what did you think about all the different groups?
user1: I thought it was a really cool way to illustrate all the different types of cliques not only in school groups but in society in general and how people can be extremely exclusive
user2: Yes, it sure brought me back to my high school days
user1: and Lindsay Lohan is fabulous
user2: Yes, her better days, bless her heart
user1: I definitely think I should rewatch Mean Girls lol
user1: been too long
user2: Yes, and the "Plastics' group.....most teen girls think they want to be like them in hs, but later in life, not so much lol
user1: lol i hear ya. being too exclusive is toxic and doesn't help you adapt to the real world where you need to learn to work well with people from different background
user1: backgrounds*
user2: exactly...and who wants to live up those expectations of a being female
user1: not i haha
user2: lol, Regina that was over the group, she was a big dose of meanness 
user1: Regina was a jerk
user1: but made the movie that much better
user2: She did, but that burn book lol...so petty
user1: lmao
user1: great
user2: But, I guess getting by a bus and breaking your spine at the end, it didn't help Regina change too much. 
user1: yeah, i see what you mean
user2: I actually didn't watch that movie until recently with my teenage daughter and she said that's about how it still is in high school
user1: yeah unfortunately girls like that are still around in high school
user1: cliquey
user2: Yes, and makes you wonder how much those can relate to school shootings, bullying others 
user2: I think we are about finished with our conversation, just a couple of more turns
user2: Well, looks like you bailed huh..... 

conversation:
user1: So, how do you feel about Mean Girls?
user2: I thought it was funny for what it was.
user2: It was a one-two-three punch for Lindsay Lohan.
user1: I liked it too. My kids enjoyed it as well. 
user1: Lindsay Lohan is a pretty good actress. 
user1: Tina Fey is  a pretty good screen writer.
user2: I agree
user2: Tina Fey really did a great job
user2: What did you think of Rachel McAdams?
user1: She is a really good actress as well. Very funny too, might I add.
user2: Do you know what the reviews were?
user1: Well, Rotten Tomatoes gave it 84% and average 6.9/10.
user1: Metacritic gave it a score of 66/100 & CinemaScore gave it a A-, which in my opinion I feel is not true. Mean Girls is a A+ teen comedy.
user2: Oh wow those reviews aren't as good as I thought.
user2: I'm surprised it got a 66 out of 100
user2: But the other reviews were good.
user1: Exactly. I agree. 
user2: I'm surprised that it came out in 2004. That was a long time ago!
user1: Yes it was!
user1: So, how did you feel about Lindsay Lohan's character, Cady?
user2: I thought she was a typical 16 year old who has been displaced from her life living in Africa. I couldn't imagine being in that position.
user1: Me either. 
user1: So, how did you feel about Regina George, Rachel McAdams character?
user2: I thought Rachel McAdams did a great job as a teenager. 
user2: She really portrayed the leader of the Plastics very well.
user2: I was surprised that McAdams was even in this movie because she usually plays more serious roles. But she did a good job playing the queen bee.
user1: Yes I agree. She was very good. 
user2: What did you think about the director, Mark Waters?
user1: He did a great job. He made the movie seem so surreal. Like I was back in highschool. 
user1: What is your take on the characters Janis & Damian?
user2: I really liked them. They added a different dynamic to the film. 
user1: At the end of the movie, how did you feel about Cady getting revenge on the rest of the "Mean Girls".
user2: I thought it was great and it was nice that she and Janis and Damian became such great friends. So funny that they met in a math class.

conversation:
user1: Have you seen Mean Girls?
user2: yep
user2: it is interesting indeed
user1: I didn't pick that movie to talk about, did you?
user2: nope, it was automatic I guess
user1: I think I saw it a long time ago, but I barely remember it
user1: it has hot girls being mean to each other is all I remember
user2: yeah that's it
user2: I like the critcism the movie brings
user2: there are some ups and downs as well
user1: I just remember it having rachel mcadams as the mega bitch
user2: lol
user1: plus it puzzled me at the time that red haired lyndsey lohan grew up in africa
user2: the setting is a public school and how to behave/adapt to that enviromnet I believe
user1: doesnt seem like the right environment for her
user1: I didnt know Tina Fey wrote it
user2: me neither
user1: now that I read all this
user2: the plot is intriguing, despite od beeing a teen movie
user1: I decided I barely remember watching it
user1: I wouldn't exactly call it "comic gold" like one of the critics
user1: I just remember it being OK
user2: It seems revenge was the main focus after all
user2: I was also surprised when I saw the Rotten Tomatoes score
user1: it is rather high for a teen girl comedy
user1: so, if it comes on netflix I may watch it again
user1: my wife would probably call me a pervert though
user2: it kinda has a plot twist
user1: what is the plot twist?
user2: IMO the way that the protagonist treats her colleagues after all
user1: meaning cady/lohan?
user2: she respects them
user2: yep
user1: she is kinda the main character/hero of the movie
user1: so she has to come out looking good and un-petty
user2: yeah
user2: but it is a hard situation to face in real life
user1: it came out in 2004?
user1: I am gettting old
user2: ow
user2: so long...
user2: couldn't remenber how old it was
user2: it seems inda recent
user1: it sure does
user1: lohan hasnt aged well
user2: :D
user1: rachel mcadams has though
user1: I dont think lacey chabert has been in anything else since
user2: could it have an american dream message in this movie?
user1: I think you are looking deeper than you should in this movie
user1: it's no Godfather or Citizen Kane
user2: :)
user1: well, expound your american dream theory
user2: I always look for symbolism
user1: I don't see it
user1: I thought this would end automatically, but the finish conversation button became clickable
user2: so did I
user1: its been 23 minutes for me
user1: I am gonna click it
user2: yep, the same here
user1: nice talking with you
user2: ok

conversation:
user2: so are you familiar with this movie? 
user1: Yes
user2: okay and what were youre thoughts on it?
user1: It's very funny and shows how clique-ish high school can be.  Are you familiar with it as well?
user2: i am to the best of my memory it was quite funny 
user2: okay why  did you leave??

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: hey
user2: Today we will be talking about the movie "Mean Girls"
user2: Have you seen it before?
user1: No, I've never seen it what is it about
user2: It is a comedy movie about a girl who was homeschooled all her life and starts going to school for the first time in a public high school.
user1: who is in it?
user2: Lindsay Lohan is the main character. It also includes Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried & Lizzy Caplan
user1: I really like Rachel McAdams.
user2: Me too, she is a great actress!
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Also, Amy Poehler is in the movie
user2: I have seen Mean Girls! :)
user1: Yeah that was pretty funny.
user2: It is a funny movie, but my favorite thing about it is how it shows how insane high school cliques can be.
user1: Yeah, that's for sure.
user2: Tina Fey is also in the movie
user1: In which movie?
user2: They are all in Mean Girls
user2: She plays a high school teacher
user1: Have you ever seen Me and girls?
user2: I have not, what is it about?
user1: That is the movie you mentioned at the beginning.
user2: Oh, my bad, I meant to put "Mean Girls" lol
user1: HA! Okay! So would you recommend the movie?
user2: I would if you like comedies and dramas
user2: One interesting thing I found about the movie is how the main character changes so much based upon those she is socializing with. 
user1: Is it something a guy would like? 
user2: Most likely, although it does seem more like a "chick flick"
user1: That's okay, I'll just enjoy watching Rachel McAdams
user1: when did you see it?
user2: Haha
user2: I don't even remember, I was like 13
user2: so about 10 years ago?
user1: How time flies
user2: Absolutely! It was nice talking to you, have a great day! :)
user1: you too!

conversation:
user1: This movie was like a "Who's Who" of early 2000's stars.
user2: It was!  What did you think about the Rotten Tomatoes review of 84%?
user1: It must have been a popular movie because of the star power.  Even CinemaScore gave it an A-.
user2: I noticed that.  Do you know anything about the non-fiction book it is partially based on?
user1: I do not.  In fact, I was surprised to see that.  I was equally surprised to see it was written by Tina Fey.
user2: I was surprised too.  Do you think Lindsay Lohan was a good pick for the Cady Heron role?
user1: Given the movie's positive critical reviews, she must have been.  I wonder whether Rosalind Wiseman has written any other books that were parlayed into movies.
user2: I was curious about that as well.  It's making me want to research that further, I'll probably google Rosalind Wiseman later.  Do you think the movie accurately portrays high school cliques?
user1: As with any satire, I'm sure it was exaggerated even though there was probably a strong grain of truth to it.  It's neat that even 8 years later Rotten Tomatoes still considered it one of the Top 50 teen comedies.
user2: Yep!  But, I was wondering about the Genre being "Comedy, teeny".  Do you think there is an appeal to audiences beyond that group?
user1: Initially, no.  But as the intended audience gets older, I'm sure it will be re-watched countless time.  Even still, I'm sure all ages can relate to dealing with cliques, especially the "Plastics."
user2: Yes, I think the "Plastics" exist in all schools.  I think the revenge aspect is pretty prevalent as well.  Do you see it that way?
user1: I actually worry that the revenge aspect might give some kids the wrong idea.  It also bothers me that Janis uses Cady to get her revenge.  I worry that Cady would be naive to that kind of thing since she had been homeschooled her whole life.
user2: I too, wondered about the homeschooling aspect of it.  I also think the fact that Cady was in Africa for 12 years made her even more naive, and susceptible to playing a role in getting revenge. 
user1: Most likely, yes.  It would have been best if Janis and Damian would have just stayed friends with Cady and let her be herself.  I'm sure her friendliness would have drawn Gretchen and Karen away from Regina.  In fact, that would have been the perfect revenge because Regina would have lost her power and influence.
user2: It's pretty sad when the most infamous group is considered the most popular!
user1: Yes it is!  Of course, I'm sure all of this was played for laughs since the movie was a comedy.  If you think about it, Cady's home life was pretty unrealistic.  Zoologist parents, twelve years in Africa...it screams hyperbole.  I guess they were really trying to play up the "fish out of water" aspect.
user2: And, she was a "fish out of water, for sure!  There is a dark side to this, however.  Regina's broken spine is pretty bad, don't you think?  
user1: I'm glad that all the deception and backstabbing finally came out when Ms. Norbury made the girls face the way they were treating each other, but I agree it was horrible what happened to Regina! Total shocker.
user2: I do love the "confrontation" in the gym.  How do you feel about that?
user1: That big fight that broke out when the Burn Book was revealed was pretty crazy, but the thing in the gym really took the cake.  Even though it was initiated by a drug-dealing math teacher.
user2: In your mind, who is the bigger villain, Regina or Janis?
user1: Probably Janis because hers was a latent rage.  It was really tricky how Regina put the fake things about herself in the Burn Book to throw off suspicion.  I hope real teenage girls aren't actually this conniving.
user2: I hope so too!  I did find the breaking of the tiara pretty significant.  And passing out the pieces to others was a genius move, don't you think?
user1: I'm really glad that Cady was able to redeem herself in the end by doing that at the Spring Fling dance.  Do you think being an outcast is what taught Cady her lesson?
user2: I think being an outcast forced her to evaluate her behavior.  We know she "gets back to old self".  I think this evolution occurs for a number of reasons.  Winning the competition, and making amends with Regina were key.
user1: Indeed. Overall, the movie had a good message.  The only way to overcome guilt is to admit your faults, and there is some good in everybody.  As Cady said, everybody is wonderful in their own way.
user2: I agree with your assessment.  I think for Cady, her declaration on stage was important to her.  It seems she is resilient enough to overcome the negatives and come out on the bright side.  
user1: I'm also really glad Cady was able to make up with Janis, Damian, and of course Aaron.
user2: It seems to me that Cady needed to get back to the way she was when she arrived at the school in order for her to like herself again.  There's quite a few lessons for all of us here.
user1: Yep.  Despite all the treachery, there are some good takeaways for other girls who may find themselves in Cady's situation.  Even though she was only 16, she was able to grow a lot emotionally.  I believe she learned to see people as they are instead of as they want to appear, the face behind the "Plastic" mask if you will.
user2: Yes.  In many ways the Plastics were not much different than the rest of the kids in school.  Sixteen is a tough age, which is clearly shown in this movie.  

conversation:
user2: Mean Girls was really a funny movie. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
user1: I'm not usually a fan of Lindsey Lohan but I enjoyed this movie as well.
user2: I totally agree with you. I do like Tina Fey's sense of humor.
user1: Yes. This movie is a great example of her writing skills. Very spot on about the reality/truth about teenage lives but finds the humor in that truth.
user2: Yes, I'm glad I didn't have to deal with some of these gals when I was in school.
user1: I did. I think everyone, especially if you're a girl, has to deal with them at some point. But I think the movie did a good job portraying a variety of groups in High School.
user2: I was a bit surprised the high Rotten Tomatoes score at 84%. They usually don't rate teen comedies that highly so they really did a good job with this one.
user1: They definitely scored great! But they casted this movie perfectly, the writing was awesome, and it was a topic that needed to be covered.
user2: Yes, I agree. All the actors in the movie did a great job. And I think Mark Waters was perfect as the director. Good job all the way around.
user1: Do you think this movie is still relevant for today's teenagers?
user2: I do.
user1: It's crazy how manipulative "the plastics" were and how easy it was to get Cady sucked into their drama right away.
user2: I know. And every time I hear the name the Plastics, it cracks me up. And Janis plotting revenge was also funny.
user1: I wonder what it would be like to move to another country while in high school. That must have been so hard.
user1: Talk about culture shock!
user2: I can't either. I moved when I was in elementary school and that was really hard. I can't imagine being a homeschooled person and ending up there.
user1: Yeah. You're given all these new rules and have to learn how to live amongst a whole different culture. New words, terms, social customs and standards, norms, everything.
user2: Cady probably didn't even know what a Burn Book was. Like you said, massive culture shock!
user1: That scene with Principal Duvall was crazy! Definitely a bit over the top, but I think the message is clear.
user2: Yeah. It also surprised me when Regina got hit by the school bus and broke her spine.
user1: Right? Ouch! Do you think she deserved it?
user2: I'm not sure she deserved that but she deserved something. lol!  Another funny part was Ms. Norbury being called a drug dealer. 
user1: haha definitely! I loved what Cady did with her tiara after being elected Queen.
user2: I was glad when Cady reconciled with Janis and Aaron. 
user2: And Damian, too!
user1: She sucked up her pride and did the right thing by making amends with everyone. Apologizing is very hard to do usually.
user2: Yes, especially in high school. It was a charming scene.
user1: I might have teared up a little bit... but don't tell anyone!
user2: I did too! I won't tell if you don't...
user1: Ok sounds like a deal

conversation:
user1: Janice is my favorite of TV ever whole movie
user1: Part*
user2: I like Janice too, but Regina George is great too. Anything done by Tina Fey is going to be great.
user1: I it reminded me of the Heather's but without a the bomb
user2: I never saw Heathers, Im going to have to check it out. I did not know this was based from a book.
user1: Yes it's about girl cliches and fitting in. I think mean girls did actually send a good message a out bullying as well 
user2: Girl Cliches can be harsh, and I think this does send a good message of that, It seems like the critics really liked it too, which seems rare for the teen movie.

conversation:
user2: What kind of movies do you enjoy?  I prefer comedy's 
user1: scarry movies and action, comedys
user2: Very nice.  Did you ever see Mean Girls?  It is one of my favorite comedy's.
user1: iv'e heard of it, but don't think iv'w watched to the end
user2: I think it is comedic gold.  It came out in 2004.  Lindsay Lohan is the star and Tina Fee (SNL fame) was the director.
user2: Are you familiar with Lindsay or Tina?
user1: yes, i love Lindsay in Herbie and The Parent Trap
user2: Classic. You should check out Mean Girls.  Not only is it funny but it does an excellent job at pointing out how terrible teenage girls can be to one another.  I think it really hit home for a lot of people
user2: I just realized I said Tina directed it.  She was actually the writer.  Mark Waters was the director.
user1: I thought that sounded off, but wasn't sure
user2: Yeah Tina got pretty high praise as the screen writer by different critics like Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone.  He is actually the one that called it comic gold
user2: Also Rotten Tomatoes named it to it's top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies.  
user1: My best friends girlfriend is going to make me watch Mean Girls later 
user1: She's in total disbelief.
user2: Yeah it is kind of crazy you haven't seen it.  It really has everything you'd want.  Lohan's character is pretty awesome.  As a viewer I loved the plot against the Mean Girls to teach them a revenge.
user2: did you go to a public school
user1: I did until until my algebra teacher disrespected me in front of the whole class so I slapped him up side his head and went to online.
user2: Wow! Lohan's character had been homeschooled up to this point so operating with all the various cliques in a public high school was new to her.  How did you deal with cliques in school
user1: I made my own cliques with friends that also didn't care about anything. but after a school event called Challenge Day I feel it really impacted the way the whole school treated eachother
user2: Challenge day.  Our local high school has that too.  I've heard great things over the years about that.  That is more productive than what happened in Mean Girls.  I don't suppose challenge day would make for a good movie though.  Lohan's character was kind of used by both cliques to get at each other.  
user2: It's pretty funny.  The "mean girls" who were called the plastics had this "burn book" that was pretty terrible but funny for a movie.  Lohan's character leaks the book to the whole school and causes a stir.  It reminded me of all the crazy rumor in high school.
user2: Sound anything like your school
user1: yes
user1: i think most schools have the same 
user1: social ways
user2: Actually in one way there is a scene kind of like challenge day. The teacher that was supposedly a drug dealer made everyone meet and talk it out.  I won't give away the ending but it doesn't go well for the worst offender.  Did most people participate in challenge day>
user1: yes, there were only a hand full of people that didn't attend  and they either skipped or stayed and did work packets 
user2: Is there anything you wish you would have said to peers that were mean to you?
user1: I said everything I wanted to say; sometimes forced to make a scene. but I made sure they knew. most of the time I would be the one to get detention 
user2: Lohan's character gets sucked into all the drama at school and eventually pays the price for her own misdeeds.  For a while she is an outcast.  The movie has so many ups and downs.  It made me remember how turbulent high school was at times
user2: That's great you got to say your piece.  Eventually Lohan was able to be honest with her peers too.  
user2: There is one really funny scene that fate gives the meanest girl revenge.  It felt great that Lohan's character didn't do it.  You ever experience anything like that? 
user1: The story line seems quality; a lot of effort went in to it from what it sounds like 
user2: Yeah.  The story line is great.  The movie has everything you'd want from a comedy.  It even has lots of twist and turns.  It will make you laugh out loud throughout the movie.  
user2: Do you laugh much at movies
user1: Yea

conversation:
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user1: The movie is Mean Girls
user2: What is is about?
user1: It was directed by Mark Waters
user2: Do you know the plot?
user1: It is about female high school social cliques and about their damaging effects
user2: Do you know who any of the stars are?
user1: Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams
user2: What is the genre?
user1: Also Lacy Chabert, Amanda Seyfried and Lizzy Caplan
user1: Teen Comedy
user2: Those are good actresses! Do you know what time frame the movie is set in?
user1: It's set around 2004
user2: What's the rating?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gives it 84% and 6.9 out of 10
user2: Does the movie have inappropriate language?
user1: I don't recall, as my notes do not specify. 
user2: What is the movie rated? PG-13? 
user1: I don't have that information, but probably is. 
user2: Have you watched the movie?
user1: Yes, I saw it about 13 years ago
user2: In your opinion, is this movie appropriate for children?
user1: In my opinion, yes.
user2: Is it appropriate for someone under the age of 13?
user1: Yes, but it depends on how much of prude you are. 
user2: HaHa, point taken. Are there any valuable lessons to be learned by watching this movie?
user1: Most likely there are for school age girls who get picked on
user2: When you watched this movie, did you laugh a lot?
user1: I honestly do no remember.  It was a comedy though.
user2: Would you recommend this movie to other people?
user1: Yes
user2: Ok thank you, I will watch this movie.

conversation:
user2: I've never heard of the director, Mark Waters, before. I'm surprised he hasn't directed more
user1: Yeah, me either however I have definitely heard of Tina Fay. She is pretty big when it comes Saturday Night Live
user2: Love Tina Fey. Her book was great
user2: This has such a great cast. A lot of people became really well-known after
user1: Yeah, folks like christin wig and others are great. My wife loves that movie brides maids. I think like all of them are in there.
user2: Kristen Wiig isn't in Mean Girls, but Rachel McAdams from the Notebook is
user2: and Amanda Seyfried from Mamma Mia
user2: It's weird that it got a 84% on Rotten Tomatoes, but only a 66/100 on metacritic
user1: I've never heard of Rachael McAdam's or Lacey Chabert but with such good reviews I'm gonna see if can find the movie on Netflix or amazon.
user2: Rachel McAdams is in a bunch of popular movies
user1: Well that all depends on the evaluation criteria. I've seen varying degrees of with those type of film rating organizations.
user2: Well, the notebook was one of the big ones
user2: Do you usually like teen comedies?
user1: No I'm not really a teen comedy type. They seem like they try a little too hard to be funny.
user2: Well, I definitely think this is one that is the top tier
user2: Tina Fey is super clever
user1: Yeah Tina fay is really funny. I remember the first time I took notice of her she was doing an impersonation of Sarah Palin. It was absolutely hilarious 
user1: I think the name "plastics" is fitting for the shallow and vain popular clique. Its just you would expect them to be, plastic
user2: Yeah. She was pretty great.  That was even after she had left SNL as head writer. 
user2: Plastics is a good name
user2: haha
user2: I think Regina George is a great name for the queen bee too. 
user2: haha
user1: "Queen Bees and Wannabees" is listed as a self help book for young high school girls. Cliques and the pressures of high school can be very hard on kids, especially girls. Seems like a book like this should be a must read.
user2: I've actually read the book
user2: It was good. 
user2: The burn book was pretty crazy in this movie
user2: This would be a completely different movie if it was made now though...all the social media
user1: Yes, the burn book. Was just reading about that and trying to figure out what it is.
user2: It's a book with a bunch of nasty secrets in it
user1: oh! someone's diary pretty much
user2: yeah. kind of 
user2: it's regina's secret stash of secrets to make sure she stays queen
user2: but she gets it in the end...since she breaks her spine.
user2: hello?
user1: Reading the key scenes, you can see that there was a pretty elaborate scheme going on here. Gets kinda bad in the end. Wouldn't have expected someone to get hit by a school bus. Ouch...
user2: It was funny in the way that it was done. 
user2: You're made to dislike her so much, that you don't really mind
user1: ok. I guess its one of those you have to see it to understand type things. 
user2: true. 
user2: plus, Cady ends up realizing that who she was originally is better anyway
user2: She joins the mathletes again for competition and helps them win
user1: I've seen my fair share of those types of characters that you love to hate and its seems like poetic justice when they get theirs in the end.
user2: it's true
user1: Always better to be your self. No one is a better you than you!
user2: haha.  a little heartfelt, but yes
user2: that's the jist of the movie
user2: gist? 
user1: yes, it seems pretty straight forward.

conversation:
user1: Have you seen this one yet?!
user2: yes i have.
user2: have you?
user2: I loved Lindsey Lohan in this movie.
user1: Me too; I thought it was pretty funny.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: what do you like about the movie?
user2: I like that it was written about Tina Fey
user1: I like that it is directed by Mark Waters, I am a big fan of his.
user2: I meant written BY Tina Fey, sorry. I also like that Amanda Seyfried was in it, I've always really identified with her.
user1: Lindsay Lohan also adds to the show
user2: I think it was a really defining movie of the time. I can't believe 2004 was so long ago now, but it's very nostalgic for me and others my age.
user1: I liked Rotten Tomatoes
user2: I wonder how much the movie was like the book it was based on, Queen Bees and Wannabees. 
user2: Do you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes rating?
user1: No, i htink it was very good and should have been rated much highrt
user2: Do you generally enjoy movies about high school?
user1: transitioning form homeschooling must have been hard for Cady
user1: the transition from Africa to illinois must have been hard as well
user2: It especially must have been hard since the Plastics AND Janis both took such an immediate interest in Cady; they basically forced her to be in the middle of a situation she wasn't ready for.
user2: It's interesting to me that the movie is set in Evanston, Illinois. I didn't remember that; i'm from Illinois originally so that's funny to me!
user1: I agree, what a hard poisiton to be in
user1: and Regina acted so horrible too
user2: You've got to have a little sympathy for her when she gets hit by the bus though!
user1: hahha true
user1: I like that they all confess their faults though
user2: That scene is so great and really funny! But it's understandable that Janis takes the opportunity to rat Cady out because the Plastics are still so awful to her.
user1: haha yes she just wanted revenge
user2: Which she immediately got when Regina got hit by the bus.
user1: but you are right poor regina getting hit by a bus and breaking her spine was no fun
user1: I like that Cady takes the blame for the burnt book
user2: I agree! And I like that she doesn't just take the title of prom queen and instead breaks the tiara and shares it with everyone.
user1: yes, and reaches a truce with the Plastics
user2: Not only does she reconcile with the Plastics, but she does so with Janis, Damian, and Aaron, too. It's such a good ending.
user1: I agree the ending was great
user2: She even joined the Mathletes and returned to her old self, which was nice to see.

conversation:
user1: I'm a big fan of Rachel McAdams, I have watched a lot of movies she has been in. you?
user2: I can not believe they rated Mean girl a 66/100 rating
user2: I love watching Rachel McAdams movies
user2: Lindsey Lohan is my hero
user1: They rated it better on Rotten Tomatoes, I like that site because it splits out ratings for critics and users.
user2: exactly why I use that site!
user1: I didn't know the film was based on a non-fiction self help book, that's interesting.
user2: The best movie rating site by far.
user1: Wow, I also didn't realize that the screenwriter was Tina Fey.
user2: Tina Fey is behind some of the best movies out ever!
user2: I never knew about her either.
user1: Kind of cool that it got listed in the top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies on Rotten Tomatoes. I wonder what it was ranked on the list.
user2: I think there is nothing close this day and age compared to Mean Girls
user2: Looking back we had no idea this movie was going to be iconic.
user1: I like it when you can recognize who did the film, just based on watching it. It's a typical Mark Waters movie.
user2: He did get a A+ for Cinema 
user1: I'm sure many teenagers can relate to the film, even though it might be a bit over the top.
user2: yes
user2: this movie is still relate able even to today. 
user1: It's the type of thing that never gets aged, because everyday in a school somewhere, the same basic themes exist. cliques are reality always.
user2: every year that goes by it seems this movie moves up higher and higher on the best movie list
user1: I wonder if they will ever remake this film, and who they'd cast for Lindsey Lohan's part?
user2: they just dont make movies like this anymore
user2: Could you imagine a Mean Girls 2?!?!
user1: It's funny how in the movie they are so ruthless. The burn book and fake libel stuff.
user2: i wonder how many burn books were created because of this movie
user1: Exactly, a teenage girl watching this movie, takes notes and brings it to reality in their own school to some degree.
user2: now they use weapons instead of name calling
user1: Well, I don't know. I don't think I can recall a female using weapons in school. It's mostly guys.
user2: the burn book could be called twitter now lol
user2: true to that
user2: mostly punk boys
user1: right, exactly, if they redid the move nowadays, it'd be social media that the lies would be spread.
user2: when you think about it
user2: social media is the reason no more of these movies come out
user1: I think newer movies look to Mean Girls for essence, and it can be recreated in new ways. that's a common storyline nowadays that things happen on social media. you are right, it's the modern day burn book.
user2: what is the most recent movei you would compare to it or used it essence?
user1: Well, it's not a specific movie, but I have seen it in a lot of shows where you see texting and social media as places to talk about people in a negative sense. They even show the device screen so you can read it.
user2: I hope they make a number 2
user2: I know meme have taken over the internet for this movie for sure
user1: But I'm sure they'd have new names nowadays as opposed to the Plastics and such
user2: haha yeah must be a new botex
user1: It's funny how Cady gets made Queen. It's weird how characters change in that movie and then regress
user2: are there any other actors that became superstars from this?
user1: Lindsey Lohan was already famous I think. I don't think you'd recognize too many others besides her.
user2: i wonder if lindsey was on drugs ever during filiing
user1: What's funny is that I do hear that term Mathletes in other shows, I wonder if it originated with this movie
user2: im not sure
user2: i think so
user1: I wonder if parents actually ground their kids anymore. Seems like taking away their devices is the new grounding.
user1: It's becoming more common that kids tend to not go outside as much. 
user2: they would have to pay sooo much for a #2
user1: I think if they did a #2, they would have to have hipsters. It would be funny to have the film remade in multiple decades to see how the style and culture of that decade changes, but it all stays the same
user2: i agree
user1: geeks are a more prominent faction nowadays.
user2: They would have to have a star studded cast and I think pay like 100 Million 
user2: It could make a BIllion though
user1: In older movies the geeks were there to be ridiculed. now they are the quirky cool kids in most media
user2: i wonder out of how many americans they have seen mean girls
user1: Homeschooling seems to be more prominent now too.  I think in some ways it's related to bullying and parents being more worried about what their kids are exposed to in public schools. 
user2: its very true
user2: I wonder the side effect of this money on main population
user1: Cady was a big reason why they won the competition.
user2: she was one of the best
user1: Has shane oman been in any movies since then? I can't recall his name in anything else
user2: i dont recall seeing him
user1: or is that just his name in the movie? 
user2: that I am not sure of.
user1: His real name is Diego Klattenhoff, which is just a few modifications away from a Hasselhoff.
user2: hahaha
user2: How old was Cady when filing
user1: I wonder how they choose the teacher/principal names. Ms Norbury. Principal Duvall. 
user2: im sure there are reasons for it
user1: I will have to look that up, and figure out if Tina Fey chose those names. She wrote the screenplay, but I wonder who came up with the original concept.
user1: ah yeah, based on the book. but makes sense that Tina fey would write the screenplay. 
user2: Tina had no idea how big this film was going to get
user2: when is this done?
user1: Mark waters has done quite a few movies that have to do with female characters.
user1: I don't know, we have been talking more than 30 minutes now. Maybe we choose to finish?
user2: i agree

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey how are you doing today?
user2: I am good, thank you.
user2: How about you?
user1: Great, just watched mean girls and love it, great movie.
user1: Are you looking for a new movie?
user2: Yes, what would you recommend?
user1: I'd say Mean Girls, it's really funny, it's mostly about high school cliques and damaging effects they can have on girls.
user1: But it's a comedy so it's not just all girly..
user2: Oh okay. 
user2: Who stars in it?
user1: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried and Lizzy Caplan with directing done by Mark Waters/
user2: So a few popular names.
user2: Sounds interesting.
user2: How did the critics rate it?
user1: Yeah for sure, it's been rated 84% by Rotten Tomatoes, A- by CinemaScore and 66/100 by Meta Critic.
user2: That is not bad.
user2: Can you tell me more about it?
user1: I can, the movie is mostly about a new girl named Cady who meets her new classmates, they warn her to avoid the most popular one "The plastics" who are lead by Regina George and Gretchen Wieners, they invite her to lunch with them. 
user1: Her friends who warned against joining that group try to use her to hatch a revenge plan on the plastics.
user2: Ha love it, "The plastics"!
user2: That's funny
user1: My favorite part is for sure their name
user2: Do they get their revenge? 
user1: You'd love the burn book part of the movie, she spreads out the content all over the school which incites a huge brawl. Regina does this herself and even burns herself in the book to make it look genuine.
user2: Burn book! That's hilarious!
user2: She sounds like a mean girl.
user1: The math teacher makes them all apologize to eachother, but Cady isn't having any of it, she continues to mock Regina who then storms out of the building and gets hit by a bus, breaking her spine. Pretty morbid twist.
user2: What!!??
user2: She gets hit by a bus!
user2: I didn't see that coming.
user1: Evidently neither did she hahahaha, but yeah Cady lost all her friends after that and she soon returned to her old personality. She ends up joining a math club and wins the competition for her school.
user2: Wow, that's sad. No friends
user2: But that's what happens when you act fake.
user2: And what ended up happening to the girl who got hit by the bus?
user1: She stayed at the school and eventually ended up making up with Cady after Cady got elected Prom Queen, broke her tiara and distributed pieces of it out to everyone.
user2: Oh, haha. I figured she would be dead.
user2: How did she get elected prom queen if no one liked her?
user1: For winning the math contest I believe
user2: Oh okay
user2: Well it sounds like something I should watch.
user2: Thanks!

conversation:
user2: I love this movie! Have you seen it? 
user1: I have! and I recently made my bf watch it too because he hasn't seen it, and he also loved it!
user1: Which character is your favorite?
user2: hahah I love it! So quotable the more people that know the better 
user2: For sure Janis Ian I love that she is the mastermind behind all the pranks on Regina
user2: What about you? 
user1: haha yes, I was going to say her too!
user1: I always forget that Tina Fey directed this. I love her scenes and the teacher
user2: I think it has a really great message too! 
user2: She is hilarious and so empowering for girls worldwide 
user1: What do you think the message of the movie is?
user2: That talking bad about other people doesn't do any one good 
user2: It makes you feel better in the moment but in the long run its not worth it 
user1: I agree
user2: Plus a really funny movie 
user1: Wow, and I didn't know it was based on a non-fiction self-help book. That makes a lot of sense!
user1: Do you think Lindsey Lohan is a good actress?
user2: I totally forgot her parents were zoologists 
user2: Yeah I think this is one of her best movies! But I still think parent trap is the best 
user2: what is your favorite scene in the movie? 
user1: I think it's really funny when they are in the cafeteria and they all turn into animal personalities. I believe it is in the beginning of the movie when Lohan is walking in for the first time. 
user1: What about yours?
user2: I like that part too! My favorite is after Regina gets hits by the bus and Cady realize all the bad things she done and has to make peace with everyone 
user2: Do you usually watch high school movies like this" 
user2: ?*
user1: Not actively, I saw the movie because I heard it was really good. Especially since I am older now I don't really like watching movies about highschool kids
user2: Do you think this accurately depicts the typical high school experience? 
user1: Oh and I do love the scene when she wins prom queen and breaks apart her tiara lol
user2: I like when her dad lets her out of the house even though she is grounded 
user1: I think it does reflect what high school is about. In my high school days I was definatly like Janis. And there is sually a click of cheerleaders
user1: High school in general is very clicky. So I think this is a good moive because it teaches you to be more accepting of others you don't know about
user2: Really? There were people that ran the school like that? 

conversation:
user1: Have you seen the movie with lindsey Lohan called Teeny?
user2: No.  I have not seen the movie.
user1: What about mean girls?
user2: I have not seen mean girls either.  Is the movie Teeny similar to mean girls?
user1: Teeny was a mistake on my part, I was thinking genre at that time. Mean girl is about high school kids bullying. I feel it is very fitting with what is happenng in Today's society
user2: That sounds interesting.   Is Mean Girls the name of the movie we are chatting about?
user1: Yes, my apologies for giving the wrong name. The movie is very engaging and puts bullying into a comedic light. It's entertaining and eye openeing as well
user2: Would it be appropriate to watch with my 12 year old granddaughter?
user1: I would say yes, I am sure she is faced with these issues in school. It may even give her some strategies to use
user2: Can you name any other actors in the movie?
user1: Racheal Adams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfreid and Lizzy Caplan
user1: Tina Fey was the director
user2: Thank you. What about language and or violence?
user2: Nice!  I love Tina Fey!
user1: Its a teenage movie, so the violence is no existant
user1: I don't recall swearing
user2: perfect!
user1: the main Character was homeschooled and now has to join the rest of the kids in public school
user1: her parents were zoologists abroad
user1: they were in africa
user2: My grandchildren are homeschooled. I imagine the eldest would enjoy it!  Thank you. That was my next question-where does it take place?
user1: It is in the USA, they returned from Africa. there is a book that gets handed through out the school, spreading rumors. The math teacher gets the book and makes all the girls sit in the gym and discuss how they are treating each other. There are lots of good lessons in the movie
user2: Sounds like a winner to me. Did it do well at the box office?
user2: Is it shown on Netflix?
user1: It has pretty good reviews. i am not sure of its box office numbers. rotten tomato give it a 6.9/10 and a cinema score of A-
user1: It is available on netflix
user1: When the book was discovered Cady takes full responsability. Cady is the main character
user2: Awesome!  Perhaps I will watch it and then clear it with my daughter-in-law for viewing.
user2: Have you seen the movie?
user2: Did the book actually belong to Cady?
user2: Have you left the conversation?
user2: Does Lindsey Lohan play the character of Cady?

conversation:
user1: So, I am confused by the critics rating systems. Rotten Tomatoes doesn't make sense to me. How does a movie receive an 84% and a 6.9/10?
user2: Right? It had no major point to it. 
user1: People are obsessed with this movie... but I've never understood why. An A-minus from CinemaScore? Really? 
user2: A self-help comedy, I don't think the Substance of the film mattered to anyone. It's move of a cult favorite, like the room. Terrible but people like it.
user1: Yeah... I guess I will never understand that. I also didn't know that Tina Fey had written it. Is this her claim to fame before SNL?
user2: She was a comedian and writer before the film 
user2: Do you usually watch fails of this genre?
user1: Not really. I definitely prefer more action-style films. Lots of Superhero films
user1: How about you?
user2: I like all types of films, I enjoy superhero films recently I saw Black Panther. I think my taste in films change as I get older.
user1: Did you enjoy Black Panther?
user2:  Yes, I was afraid it was going to be overrated but it was perfect.
user1: I just finished the film last night myself and felt the same way, but also had the same result! I am thinking of going to see it again because it was that good!
user2: What would you rate mean girls 
user1: 3.5/10
user1: It just wasn't memorable or exciting to me. Nothing across the board, whether it be the acting, costuming, cinematography, script, etc. Was any good to me
user1: The only positives I can come up with is I do think the film was cast correctly.
user1: How about you?
user2: I think I would give it a 5/10. I think it means something to younger people but of course you become wiser and understand how this film has no heart behind it.
user1: I will admit that there does seem to at least be a good message of avoiding being in a clique during grade school. 
user2: I guess you are right. The other message  being do not have compassion for people who do you wrong.
user2: What did you think of the acting?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: looks like ratings for this movie are all over the place!
user2: 84% on rotten tomatoes is very impressing 
user1: I am not familiar with Metacritic.
user2: but this is a movie for teenagers for the looks of it.
user1: Yea looks like it, teen comedy it says.
user1: Not my cup of tea
user2: metacritic is the hardest of them all 
user1: ill have to check out that site. im used to rotten tomatos and imdb
user2: Are there any male actors on the film or just girls?
user1: Doesn't look like it, I just says "female high school social cliques and the damaging effectsthey can have on girls."
user1: Lindsay Lohan only one I know.
user2: yes, but without male actors it will be a lesbian movie 
user1: yeah doesn't sounds like very entertaining, judging by the scene described it is catty like 
user2: uau, the plot looks more deeper than i thought the movie would be
user1: two cliques and a new girl both are interested in
user1: imagine being in africa 12 years and having to live in Illinois?!?!
user2: So, this is a movie about cliques in high school.Who did not ever belong to one?
user1: i think two rival popular girls
user1: Janis and Cady are each groups "leader" by sounds of it
user2: The plot seems to cliche to me, nothing original there, except for the Africa thing
user1: interesting, it says The film is partially based on Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 non-fiction self-help book QueenBees and Wannabes,
user1: wonder if book better than movie lol
user2: The burn book becomes the central piece in the movie, it must be very powerful
user1: regina sounds like a Witch....
user2: yes, but she did not deserve to have her spine broken, that was to much
user1: oh wow, just read that
user1: sounds like a crazy movie!
user2: yes, the plot took another direction, a darker one
user1: burn book sounds terrible.. i think Regina wrote it thats why she wrote a fake one so it didnt make her look guilty
user1: so all's well ends well at the end of the movie.
user2: Regina is the typical sociopath.Insecure, liar and conniving   
user1: yeah she has some issues i think
user2: the mathlete plot was looked very forced and boring
user1: yes pretty dull for sure
user2: Whatever happened to Regina at the end? She probably became anorexic 
user1: yeah i imagine she came to her senses after being hit by a bus, maybe stopped being mean

conversation:
user1: Mean Girls, Personally I've never seen this movie (as far as I remember). But I believe is pretty much a cult movie in pop culture. Right?
user2: Hi, let's get started. This is an interesting movie.
user2: It was a top teen comedy and had a pretty decent cast.
user1: Hey! Have you seen it? Ok, the movie is basically about highschool drama (social live) 
user1: Is it really accurate to wwhat you would see on an American HS?
user1: Highschool, not American Horror Story lol
user2: I have seen it but it has been years. rachel mcadams is one of my favorite actresses.
user2: tina fey is such a great writer, no wonder it had so much success.
user1: Yeah, I just learned that she was the writer! She's amazing
user1: What did you liked about the movie?
user2: i usually refer to rotten tomatoes whenever i want to see a movie, i had no idea that this one was rated so high.
user2: i think it is still relevant due the clique that sill occur, not only in school but everyday life.
user1: due you rely only on Rotten tomatoes?
user1: how do you decide what movie to watch?
user2: im surprised to learn it was released in 2004, it doesnt seem like it was that long ago that it was released
user1: Geez, right, still really relevant... You see memes/gifs of that movie all the time
user2: i get my initial opinion from trailers, but if i unsure i will read reviews
user2: ha, yeah i still do see memes from time to time. 
user2: im pretty sure one of my friends dropped a quote the other day
user1: which was it/
user1: but at the end, do they end up as friends (Cady and Regina)
user2: im trying to remember, like i said it had been awhile since i last saw it
user2: its definitely worth a watch if you have some free time
user2: i think it comes on network cable a lot
user1: I bet, I have to watch it. Probably I'll finally get some jokes
user2: it might be lindsay lohan's best (not saying much)
user1: Really?
user1: I still remember in that twin movie
user1: Mathletes? lol, that's funny.. What even is that?
user2: she makes amends with the other girls by the end of the film
user2: its like an academic competition team
user1: They were just jelous to her for being new/pretty girl I bet
user2: thats what high school is all about right(sarcastically)? trying to be popular and liked.
user1: haha true, pretty much everywhere
user1: I'm not from the US, but still applies 
user2: the burn book was pretty weird. i wonder if girls really did that.
user1: Still, with this movies (and college movies - american pie lilke) they always push it to far and that's the perception that everyone has about the US
user1: That's absolutely possible
user2: the girls in the movie definitely were mean to each other.
user1: So they were true to the title
user1: But I bet the only mean one was regina
user1: the other just followed here
user2: would you watch the movie now, given the info that we learned?
user2: what intrigued you the most about it?
user1: I would
user2: did your school expereince relate to theirs?
user1: probably on a saturday evening while doing something else. 
user2: what type of movies du you ususally go for'
user2: have you seen many in this genre?
user1: Or saturday morning, I'll have a good laughNot at all, boy school - catholic school. dynamics totally different. 
user1: I've seen those. I usually don't care about a specific genre
user1: just if I like it or not (trailer) 
user2: lacey chabert had a pretty forgetful career, but was good in this one
user1: Yeah, haven't seen anything of her
user1: Daddy daycare and that's it
user1: Look

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Do you generally watch Comedy movies?
user1: yes. I like comedy movies.
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user1: I have not seen the movie. Have you?
user2: I have, I thoroughly enjoyed it
user1: Is LIndsay Lohan a good actress?
user2: The critics seem to think so
user1: Other than bad things about Lindsay, I have never heard of LIndsay as an actress.
user2: I can't comment
user1: May I know why since you have seen one of her movies?
user2: That's out of scope for this discussion. Do you like the plot of this movie?
user1: I like Tina Fey for sure.
user2: I like the revenge plan, I thought it was very cunning
user1: The movie has below average review.  I do not know if I want to waste my time watching it.
user2: It's got 84% on RT with an average 6.9/10, metacritic score of 66/100 and a CinemaScore of A-, they're certainly impressive reviews
user1: The plot sounded interesting. Is Tina Fey in the movie?
user2: Tina Fey wrote the movie and is credited as screenwriter
user1: thanks for the info
user2: What do you think of the plot?
user1: It sounds interesting.  I may see it if I have time.
user2: The plot interests me too!
user1: I will see the movie in summer with my grand kids.
user2: I like that Cady Heron is elected as Queen
user1: Is Cady a good guy in this movie?
user2: I'm unsure, however Cady is female
user1: So, is she the main character?
user2: Yes, Cady Heron is the main character

conversation:
user1: Hi, there!  Have you seen Mean Girls? It's considered kind of an okay teen comedy.
user2: Yes, I have seen it. It looks pretty good, scoring fairly high on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: I did not realize tina fey wrote it
user1: Yes, RT can be pretty brutal!  The screenplay seems to have been widely praised. I haven't seen it -- it looks like i ought to!
user2: I just noticed it features Lacey Chabert, who was the original voice of Meg from Family Guy
user2: and then she disappeared
user1: Oh, really? That's interesting! I never saw that. I think it's interesting there is a character named Janis Ian, who sang a song, "Seventeen," about being excluded socially, so it's kind of "like the movie," if yu know what i mean.
user2: Are you seeing a one page document? I thought there would be 3 pages
user1: What will happen is new paragraphs will appear when we've talked enough about this one... ;)
user2: Is it a volume thing or a time thing?
user1: I kind of like Lindsay Lohan as a teen star. I've seen her in a couple of other things, so I may look this movie up.
user1: See -- the new paragraph appeared. Volume thing.
user1: It looks like a typical girls-against-girls plot. Too bad.
user2: yes. no boys allowed!
user2: I remember Jamie Lee Curtis being in it, but I think I am confusing this movie with Freaky Friday
user1: Yes, exactly.
user2: Amanda Seyfreid, i think is prmarily a singer. I wonder if she sings in this
user1: I think it would be a real culture shock to move from Africa to Evanston, Illinois.
user2: I think she lived in the wilderness with her parents. She didn't really come from African culture.
user2: She doesn't have a South African accent in the movie
user2: I mean, I can't see Lndsay lohan pull off that accent.
user1: OMG, I can't believe they pull the old "hit by a car" chestnut. I just saw a movie with that last night!!!!!  Re Africa - I figured as much, but still culture shock. Probabaly. I don't know. Maybe she was in a really lilly white setting there!!!
user1: I'd bet charges would be pressed against a student today who defamed a teacher as a drug dealer.
user2: I think it is refreshing to see a teenage girl get hit by a bus. I wonder if the girls watching this found it funny
user1: Ha ha ha!  Maybe you're right. 
user1: I wonder if her spine is fixed, or if she's paralyzed, and to what extent? Probably a full recovery and a great prom date!
user2: Perhaps a sequel!
user2: Who is she shunned by
user1: Exactly!  NO! Friendless!!!!! An outcast!!!!!
user2: What is the book called
user1: Queen Bees and Wannabees
user2: What is the main girls' name?
user1: She shares the pieces of her (symbolic) broken tiara with the other girls. My good ness.
user1: Cady
user2: What is the teacher's name
user1: And everyone goes to the seashore in the end (metaphorically). Happy happy!
user1: Not sure which on the teacher is.
user2: it is Ms. Norbury
user2: (just making conversation)
user1: I think we're good, so I'm gonna say so long! :)

conversation:
user1: This movie is a solid choice if you want to see something enjoyable
user2: I agree, and it seems like the critics generally agree as well.
user1: It was a good choice to base a comedy off of a non-fiction book based on real studies..comedy made from real elements is the best kind
user2: Yes, I didn't realize this was partially based on a book. Its interesting that they took what seems to be a serious book about the effects of "mean girls" and turned it into a comedy.
user1: I wonder how they chose to do that, since they could have easily turned it into a drama also
user2: Maybe they were possibly wanting to make it somewhat satirical to show just how ridiculous teenage girls can be toward one another. 
user1: That could be, I guess.
user2: I enjoy movies with the early Lindsey Lohan as a part of the cast.
user1: I think probably it was relatable and spoke to people as a teen comedy
user2: For sure... Is there supposed to be another document? I still only have page one?
user1: The one paragraph synopsis is interesting, seems to summarize it pretty well.
user2: Yes, I see that now. It does seem to stop the summary very early in the plot of the movie though.
user1: I think it was a calculated but good choice to have a character's last name be 'weiners' sublte comedy
user2: Yes, and I also enjoy the irony in the term "Plastics." As society generally equates preppy girls to barbie dolls which are made of plastic. 
user1: metacritic score was the lowest, it seems. wonder what that demographic is
user2: If I had to guess, I would assume older adults since this movie was generally aimed toward a younger demographic. 
user1: the second scene listed does seem pretty unrealistic though, but i know with movies we have to suspend our disbelief a little. 
user2: Yes, the fact that everything is sorted out by confessing transgressions seems very unrealistic. I was surprised that they chose to have Regina have such a brutal ending to this scene.
user1: yes, it seems unrealistic that everyone would turn on the 'queen bee,' it seems more likely her loss of power would be fleeting.
user2: Yes, and I feel that Regina would quickly gain the sympathy of the school due to her injuries. This would result in undoing all of the "miraculous" confessions of transgressions and back to the same status quote.
user1: hopefully the movie still spread awareness and made a difference
user2: I think that it did, considering its popularity among teenagers
user1: It seems the movie ended with a 'balance is key' kind of message
user2: Agreed, and I think that was symbolized by her breaking the tiara. I find it ironic that she went from being in the stereotypical plastics to the mathletes.
user1: yeah, math is stereotypically 'dorky' and not cool
user2: Its also interesting that Shane is crowned king and Cady is crowned queen. Seems like some foreshadowing.
user1: for shadowing for what?
user2: Their reconciliation at the end.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Mean girls, 2004. Have u seen the movie?
user2: Hi
user1: I have not seen that movie.

user2: Mcadams 
user2: Lohan
user2: Amanda Siegfried
user2: Seyfried 
user1: well that doesn't really sound like it would interest me.
user2: Haha 
user2: It only got an 84% on rotten tomatoes
user1: 84 isn't too bad. I've seen movies with much lower that were quite good
user2: Ohhh ok
user1: but that title and the people in it don't really make it sound interesting at all is the problem
user2: It's directed by mark waters 
user2: Have u heard of him
user1: I haven't heard of him. I wonder if he's done anything good
user2: Yea I have no idea
user1: I don't think this movie will make it on my netflix list
user2: Agreed
user1: lindsey lohan hasn't made a decent movie since that one when she was a kid
user2: Yup
user1: and I don't even know who those other people are. so yeah....average reviews with no idea what it's about other than "mean girls" and people I don't know or don't care for. Not much to go on there lol
user1: so do you know anything else about this movie?
user2: Hmm..in 2012 it was rated as in the top 50 greatest comedies
user1: well at least that sounds promising I guess. 
user1: Does this sound like the kind of film you would enjoy
user2: No
user2: Not at all
user1: What kind of movies do you enjoy
user2: Hmm good question

user2: The movie is Mean Girls.
user2: Hi!
user1: Hi!
user2: It is highly rated.

user1: What is the movie about?
user1: I have never seen it.
user2: It is a high school comedy.
user1: Ok, who is in the movie?
user2: It's got great actresses. rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Lindsay Lohan.
user1: Oh Nice! What is the storyline for the movie?
user2: Even Rotten Tomatoes gave it a good score and named it in it's Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies
user1: Oh then it must be pretty good.
user1: I think I will definitely check it out the next time I have some free time.
user2: Storyline - there's a new girl in a high school, awkward, and finds a questionable group of frenemies. Then shenanigans.
user1: I like shenanigans!
user2: Me too!
user2: This movie was written by Tina Fey. I didn't know that, but I like it even more now.
user1: Yea Tina Fey is really funny.
user2: So is the movie!
user1: Are there any other ratings other than Rotten Tomato?
user2: Lindsay Lohan plays the main role of the awkward new girl
user2: CinemaScore is A-
user1: So it's pretty much consistent across the board.
user1: When was Mean Girls released?
user2: This came out in 2004. 
user1: Oh so this is an older movie.
user2: it is, but it is still popular and VERY quotable
user1: So the movie still holds up?
user2: I see people quote it often
user2: Absolutely!
user1: That's cool, most old movies don't hold up too well after time.
user2: I think you'll like this movie. Have a great day :)

conversation:
user1: How did you feel about the movie, "Mean Girls"?
user2: I felt like it was a good comedy about a subject that is actually very serious - the cliques teen girls form in high school.
user1: I liked it overall, and I feel like it's become almost a cult classic so to speak. I felt that Lindsey Lohan especially was doing some of her better acting then. Who was your favorite character?
user2: I think Lizzy Caplan as Janis Ian was great. Some of the other actresses also did a fine job, but were overlooked because of Lindsay Lohan.
user1: OMG YES I loved Janis, I don't feel she got as much credit as she should have! A close second for me was Gretchen, I just felt that she really played that high school drama queen part well! 
user2: I really liked Gretchen, too! It probably helped a lot that Tina Fey wrote the screenplay. She's a very good writer.
user1: I agree, but Janis I felt I could relate too a bit :) What was your favorite part? I'm actually surprised they picked a movie I know well, I was worried I was going to get stuck with one I wasn't sure of!
user1: Excuse me, to*
user1: I never knew Tina Fey wrote the screenplay very interesting!
user2: Really? The instructions stated we were not to talk about things we knew from personal knowledge, but from the information in their paragraph. There isn't much information here actually! LOL
user1: No there isn't!!! And I just noticed that Tina Fey's name is at the bottom, duh. Soooooo I guess my next question is do you agree with the rating? I feel like I mostly do, it surprised me for the genre
user2: It's not a genre I'm really into. If I watch a teen movie it's probably one where they are being chased by a giant prehistoric alligator. 
user1: HAHA I like horror too even though that's way off topic and action and a little comedy and family because I have a small child! Back on topic, lol, have you heard of the director or do you have an opinion of him?
user2: His name doesn't ring a bell with me at all. The critics sure seemed to love it though. What a culture shock it would be to go from homeschooling in Africa to a suburban public high school.
user1: It REALLY would be, they made that part pretty realistic I feel! How about the book? Have you ever heard of or read it? I have heard of it and thought about getting it because I'm a big reader - but I ended up not picking it up yet
user2: I haven't read it although if it came up available free somehow I would. I'll read anything. I wonder how it went from a serious self help book to a comedy? I mean, who got that spark? 
user1: LOL I have no idea, I feel like it was partly to get the seriousness of bullying out there but turning it into a comedy kind of shot that out unfortunately 
user2: Well when something happens in your life you always get to choose to laugh about it or cry about it. Myself, I always think it's better to find a way to laugh it off if you can. I would imagine it's really theraputic if you were a victim of that kind of thing to be able to look back and see how ridiculous it all really was and move on. 
user1: I agree, I really fight for people who get bullied but I also want people to pick themselves up and empower themselves as I do that myself
user1: I see the next topic has arrived! Have you ever had that serious of a situation like this happen at your school? I don't think I've ever seen someone copy and throw papers all over the hallways but ... still lol. And we just talked about the culture shock. I feel like Cady learned a lesson to be with people who accept her instead of running for popularity
user2: I also believe karma works. So, when Regina gets hurt - that's karma. We don't always see it so clearly and obviously, of course. I don't really know if anything like that happened at my high school. By that point I was so thoroughly and completely ostracized they could have burnt the school down and I wouldn't have known a thing about it until I arrived for class the next day. 
user2: I had a different kind of childhood with a lot of real life drama such as my step-father's lengthy illness and death, my mother running a business in the 1960s and trying to "cover" it as his business (it was originally) because a woman, of course, can't run a business! 
user1: I unfortunately had some problems myself in childhood and I feel that this movie says alot about how women should empower and not undermine each other. And I HEAVILY believe in karma, I'm very spiritual. I feel that was a little much with her at the end of the movie with the spine break though! That was pretty serious
user2: Yeah that's not a minor injury at all. I was sitting here thinking though and when I was in school, bullying wasn't even called that. It was just part of how things were and you were expected to figure out how to deal with it. As positive as I think it is that bullying is now considered a negative thing and something adults should step into, I also wonder if we are really preparing our children for the real world. If your boss is a bully, there isn't any higher authority. And I know there are cliques and politicking in any real office situation and if you don't know how to handle yourself you could lose your job or at least never have any upper mobility.
user1: I was born in 91 and even when I was in school up until I hit high school it wasn't like that in my area, in middle and elementary school it was just the way it was also. I feel like the movie is pretty extreme in the bullying though, and I'm also glad it's considered negative. In the movie I don't feel Cady was prepared for the real world but I also don't feel many of the other characters were either
user1: Only because they did not handle situations in a professional and assertive manner, they went into an aggressive rage which is not the right way to do things in nearly any situation
user2: Exactly. I realize it is a comedy, but it is dealing with a serious matter. I also take issue with everyone apologizes and hugs it out and it's all over. Very sweet. Not very real. The girls in my high school were certainly perfectly capable of hugging you in front of the teacher while whispering threats in your ear. 
user1: Yes!! Exactly and I feel like that's whats going on here. And as far as Aaron and the spring fling and Cady and Regina in the movie there was alot of jealousy involved to the point where the revenge was the main goal..  I hope to see this further break down so that more positive behavior is shown in schools. I see in the text and remember all the revenge plots
user2: Again, I hope what people get from this movie is looking at that - all that jealousy and revenge and drama - and realize with a few years of perspective how truly unimportant any of it is in real life. I guess older people might see that. Do you think the teen audience really learns anything from it though?
user1: No I actually dont! I am 26 now and I see it in a much different light now. When I first saw it I didn't take it seriously, I was kind of like 'oh that would never happen' bc I've had people talk behind my back but never a really serious event or to my face. And never anything close to this.  And I also feel that I've gained respect for people coming in as exchange students or moving from another country because our country is alot tougher and harder to live in in some aspects. Easy in some too, but not with everything. 
user1: I wish that Cady would have taken the warning from Janis! I feel like people don't listen to their best interest alot of the time when they're in teen years
user2: Right. I agree - I certainly never heard of anything this extreme really happening in a school, although I know that a drama involving a single classroom or group of kids can seem like a really huge thing and then even the next year it is all a "tempest in a teapot" and no one really cares. I don't know - do you think maybe Cady didn't believe Janis though. With no experience of teen society to draw on, and only her positive experiences with her parents and socially, maybe she simply couldn't believe people were that crazy.
user1: YES I really do feel that way, I feel that some other countries and cultures have a deeper respect than many people do here. We have our fair share of respectful people too but it was most certainly a shock as you said before :)
user1: I see the gymnasium part is listed here where everyone was gathered to stay after school, I feel that was an admirable thing for the teachers and students to organize to get together and openly speak to eachother that way
user2: As far as teen decision making - you have to remember that at that stage in life teens want to be themselves, they are at that stage of becoming individuals. And so the decision making process gets derailed in the "I want to be different" as the number one reason. Not better, or even doing what they really want, just doing whatever they were told not to do so as to show they CAN do it. I'm not sure I'm stating this well. LOL. 
user1: You are, I completely understand because I wanted to do what I wanted to do then and that was it and wouldn't take any criticism which is probably true of all the teen characters in the film
user1: I felt Miss Norberry made an excellent effort not only at teaching but at bringing everyone together towards the end of the movie
user2: Yes, so that part is entirely realistic. As far as the gathering in the gymnasium, it is great and suits a movie, but I'm not sure I can see that happening in real life. But then, it's been a long time since I was in high school, so maybe that has changed. Mrs. Norberry does seem like a teacher who goes above and beyond the call of duty - and thank goodness there really are teachers like that. 
user1: There most certainly are! I remember having one or two. I feel principal Duvall was a little lacking in understanding though, but that may very well have been because this was an all out girls fight through the school which he probably didn't understand. He tried his best though! lol
user1: All in all, I feel it was good on both a learning level and as a movie and deserving of the rating. I wish it was taken a little more seriously, but I guess it needed beefed up a little for hollywood (I'm sure you know how that is)
user2: Yeah, men do not get it at all. Not that young men don't sort of gather up in cliques of their own, but they are really based more on mutual interests than status for the most part. I don't think they really do all the gossiping and status stuff. 
user1: I don't believe so either, or at least not as much as the women do. I don't feel they find it as important, I think Aaron in the movie thought they were all crazy!
user2: Right - you couldn't really base a movie on a self help book and not have it be dead boring. By making it a comedy, then there is some hope that someone might learn something while they are laughing about it. And, of course, the studios purpose is not teaching or improving anything, but making money.
user1: I definitely agree with money factor in the whole thing more than the important message.
user1: Do you have any other thoughts on the movie?
user2: Not really. Not really my cup of tea, of course. I think I've gained some insight from our discussion though - as off topic as we may have been a few times. There might be redeeming factors to a silly teen comedy.
user1: I feel that I have looked into deeper insight myself with out discussion, and I'm much more tempted to pick up the book to read now to see how it relates and if it is in fact more to the point since it is considered a self help book
user2: Good point. I wonder how much it is and if it is on Kindle. That's quite a leap from self help to comedy - but the best self help books use humor so maybe the book is funny? 
user2: Most of the time when a movie is based on a book, I find I prefer the book. But I am more of a reader than a movie watcher, so maybe that's just me.
user1: Does this stop automatically when the conversation is over? Or must we abort conversation? We have been typing awhile now - so long that I cannot remember as I have been focused on our discussion. I don't feel it's going to be that funny but maybe have a few elements of humor to add to it, not as funny as the movie though!
user1: Well "funny" I'm also more of a book reader than a movie person!
user2: Wow. I just checked and we have used 110 of the 120 minutes. We have to have had at least 12 responses. I'll scan up and see if we do.
user2: We have well exceeded that. Maybe this "finish conversation" button?
user1: Time did go fairly fast with the hit and for not having a ton of info to discuss we were able to pull alot (: so that's good but yes! I feel that I saw a twelve or fifteen response number for each page. 

conversation:

user2: Yes, I like the actresses. 
user2: This is one of the first scenes of the movie, when Cady first gets to her new high school.
user1: yes, the movie based on the girls high school. 
user2: Two of Cadys best friends are Janis and Damian.
user2: They create a plan of revenge against Regina.
user1: the girl was educated in Africa by her parent then they move to the suburbs of Illinois.

user1: thank you
user1: nice to talk with you

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: hey there!!
user2: The movie we will be discussing is mean girls!! 
user1: Oh nice!
user1: I like that movie.
user1: Who is in that one again?
user2: its really good! It was given a cinema score of an A- and rotten tomatoes gave it an 84%
user1: Oh wow, much higher than I remembered
user2: Rotten Tomatoes named it as "top 50 Greatest teen comedies"
user1: was there a lead actress as well?
user2: Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams
user1: Oh yes, they were great in it
user1: Did they say how it did in the box office?
user2: Yea! Lindsay Lohan was Cady Heron and Rachel McAdams was super mean as Regina George!
user2: Nope! That info isnt here... but I wonder the same
user1: Ha, that would be good to know. Was there anyone else in the movie? 
user2: I had no idea its based on a book by Rosalind Wiseman 
user1: Oh wow really?
user2: Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried and Lizzy Captain!
user1: I didn't know that either!
user2: Yea it was a self-help book titled Queen Bees and Wannabees
user2: They talk about female high school social cliques and the damaging effects that it can have on girls
user1: Her last name is Captain? That's awesome! and it's also awesome about the book!
user1: What is the movie about again? or is it pretty similar to the book?
user2: Yea! It was directed by Mark Waters and written by Tina Fey! Tina Fey is pretty funny!
user1: Oh wow, was Tina Fey in the movie too? She's everywhere!
user2: Its pretty similar to the book.. basically a girl starts at a new school and learns about different cliques.
user2: The "plastics" is a clique led by a rich girl who is so mean and bullies her!
user1: That name sounds mean! plastics? Haha wouldn't want to be in that clique
user2: But eventually the new girl gets revenge and the mean girl learns her lesson and is struck by a school bus and breaks her spine!
user1: Was the story based in a particular setting or city?
user2: I would not either!! Especially since bullies are involed.
user2: Evanston, Illinois
user1: Oh, Evanston definitely sounds like a bully town
user2: lol!! The new girl was 16 and homeschooled before joining the new school since her parents were zoologists and worked on a twelve-year research trip in africa!
user1: Was there a boyfriend in the story too?
user2: pretty cool huh?
user1: Oh wow! that is pretty cool! 
user2: No! no boyfriends
user2: actually yea!! REgina had a boyfriend!
user2: Shane Oman!
user1: Ah! I knew it!
user2: Totally forgo abou that part lol
user2: forgot about*
user1: But yes, I definitely would love it if my parents were zoologists!
user1: And I would love to be from anywhere but the US at this moment...
user2: Yea but I dont know how I would feel being homeschooled and being the new girl in high school.
user1: Ha, so true. Those I could do without
user2: Illinois seems like a pretty quiet place also.. not too much fun!
user1: true true. They should have made it Hollywood or something, much more fun

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: HI
user1: Would you like to talk about Mean Girls?
user2: Sure. I thought Lindsay Lohan was good in the movie. What about you?
user1: Yes Lindsay Lohan really played her role well to show how social cliques are bad in society.
user2: This movie was highly praised by critics. Do you usually like to see movies with high ratings?
user1: Yeah, I remember the Rolling Stones called it comic gold. I love high ratings for a movie, but there are some good ones with low ratings. Even this movie has Metacritic score of 66/100 but I think it should be higher. What else did you like about it?
user2: I enjoyed that it dealt with the serious topic of female high school cliques through comedy. I thought Tina Fey adapted Rosalind Wiseman's book "Queen Bees and Wannabes" well into a film.
user2: Do you generally like comedies?
user1: The social cliques damage girls and that is why it was referred to as a "knockout." It even made  one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies
user1: Comedies are great, especially this one. The reference to the clique girls as Plastics makes me laugh
user1: Did you know it got a cinema score of A-?
user2: Haha yeah, hearing Jan and Damian describe the Plastics to Cady was great. 
user2: Wow, that's a good score. It seems like CinemaScore appreciated having the great team of Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Mark Waters together.
user1: When Cady joins the Plastics, Janis plots revenge because she is excluded and uses Cady as ammo. Who else is your favorite character?
user2: I liked Janis because she started plotting against the Plastics and welcomed Cady when she arrived. Regina is interesting too because she's the most popular.
user2: Why do you think the Plastics invited Cady to sit with them at lunch?
user1: Rachel McAdams as Regina George complemented the role played by Lindsay Lohan, Cady because she plays queen bee real well. I think she invited Cady to sit with them to smell the roses and see if Cady was Plastics material, outside appearance having already qualified. 
user1: What is another scene you like?
user2: Oh yes I think you're right. I liked the scene where Principal Duvall called all the girls into the gym to settle the problems caused by the Burn Book. Could you believe that Janis actually confronted Regina?
user1: Janis must have been fueled by rage because she defied Ms. Norbury. Really tragic when Regina storms out and is hit by a bus, breaking her spine. The director crippled her, indicating cliques cripple everyone involved what do you think?
user1: There may even be a hidden warning about the dangers of attending a public school; suggesting cliques are a public school occurrence? Do you see any hidden messages in key scenes?
user2: Wow, I hadn't thought of it like that! Yeah the clique destroyed the relationships between the students with the teachers and each other, and having Regina get hit by a bus was a great way to illustrate that point. 
user2: Hmmm even when Janis stands up to Regina Cady still tries to apologize. I think that shows that Cady still sees Regina as a predator or alpha/queen of the school, maybe a reference to the animal kingdom since her parents are zoologists.
user2: I bet it was hard for Cady to integrate into public school since she'd been homeschooled. What role do you think Janis and Damian represent in the movie?
user1: Is it me or is screenwriter Tina Fey playing with the image of Regina George, as suburban public schooled Barbie, polar opposite of Legally Blonde character as ethical and beautiful ?
user1: Janis and Damian represent the outcasts hanging on the fringe. Cady recognizes everyone wants to belong when she breaks her plastic tiara and passes out the pieces after saying everyone of her classmates is special in their own way. She acts as the bridge between the oucasts and the clique members. Cady may represent confident, but not over confident like the Plastics or underconfident like the outcasts, what do you think?
user2: I actually haven't seen Legally Blonde, but if Regina is the end product of public school cliques then definitely not a positive image. I think that made the contrast even stronger when Cade reverted to her old personality and joined the Mathletes
user1: I agree, but the change in her may have been brought about by a desire to belong. This desire to belong, Tina Fey may be suggesting is dangerous. 
user2: Yeah, Cady really connected everyone together in the end. Maybe Tina Fey was commenting that someone inside a situation can't see how destructive it is, and it really takes an outside perspective to fix things.
user1: You know the book is based on Rosalind Wiseman's self help book Queen Bees and Wannabes
user1: Interesting point about Cady highlighting damaging effects of cliques for girls
user2: Ok, so even though Cady bridged everyone together she was also human and susceptible to the social desire to belong. That must be a theme of the book
user2: Do you think Cady joined the culture in the end after changing it, or always remained a little bit of an outsider?
user1: Girls are typically social and emotional creatures, she even reconciles with everyone and makes peace. I think Cady remained an island unto herself like Switzerland that was neutral but could communicate with both, because she "reaches a truce"; neither an outsider nor an insider because she rejected the rules they had in place before.
user2: Yeah I think she probably learned a lot from the experience, and changed everyone else as well. 
user2: Good talking to you, thanks!
user1: good talking to you as well. Thanks

conversation:
user1: So, what do you think about the movie? 
user2: Very funny. I didn't know that Tina Fey was the screenwriter for the movie.
user1: That was news to me too! 
user2: Who was your favorite character?
user1: Lindsay Lohan and Rachael McAdams did a great job with their characters 
user1: How about you? Who did you like? 
user2: I agree! I thought it deserved higher than 84% on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Yes, the A- score seems more fair!
user2: I loved Amanda Seyfried's character!
user1: I don't really follow directors much, are you familiar with Mark Waters?
user1: She was hilarious!! 
user2: I am not familiar with him. 
user2: I never quite grasped why Cady's parents didn't just continue to homeschool her after twelve years!
user1: That is a good question, maybe they wanted her to have a more "normal" school experience?
user1: That would be a giant culture shock going from the plains of Africa to a city in the US. 
user2: That was my first thought! I loved the characters Janice and Damian. They made the whole movie in my opinion!
user1: Yes, it was definitely the mean girls who made it!
user1: Haha! Maybe that's why it's called that! 
user2: Haha probably! The story line of Janice using Cady to get back at Regina for revenge from something done to her in the past was interesting. Cady is obviously a vulnerable subject to get used in that way having been sheltered from "normal" school life for so long
user2: My jaw dropped when Regina was hit by the school bus!
user1: That was definitely a surprise!
user1: And yet really funny!
user2: Hilarious! It made me sad when they called Ms. Norbury a drug dealer! She seemed so cool.
user1: That whole book was so mean 
user1: I'm glad they finally realized how horrible they were being
user2: I know! I thought it was weird how the book only contained stuff about the girls and a few teachers. No boys.
user2: Boy students however
user2: I thought it was sweet when she gave pieces of her tiara away
user1: Yes, and that she was able to become who she really was, or go back to who she really was...
user2: I think find out who she really was.
user1: It's cool that she ends up in good relationships with everyone too
user2: Exactly! It's the perfect story of reconciliation.
user1: The popular and not so popular too
user1: Yes, and how people can change for the better
user2: Everyone sort of ends up on the same level at the end.

conversation:

user2: hello

conversation:
user1: Have you read the document about Mean Girls?
user2: I have read it.  I think the scores are interesting.
user1: What do you find interesting about the scores?
user2: I thought the movie was interesting and entertaining.  I guess the Rotten  Tomatoes gang does not agree with me.
user1: That's odd that you say that as Rotten Tomatoes named Mean Girls to it's "top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies" list in November 2012. Did you actually read the document carefully?
user2: I just reread the portion that you are referring to, ironically.  I was wrong.  I guess I DO have good taste :)
user2: Have you seen the movie?  What do you think of it?
user1: If you were actually a computer program or AI that was chatting with me, what part of the document regarding the moving "Mean Girls" do you think would be the most difficult part to discuss without betraying to me that you were, in fact, not a person?
user1: I have seen the movie. It was not created for people with my taste in movies. I'm assuming that this may be because it was based on Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 non-fiction self-help book "Queen Bees and Wannabes."
user2: I think the most difficult part would be discussing whether you had seen the movie, or what you thought of it.
user1: That's a good answer. Have you seen the movie? Are you a human being?
user2: I am a human being who has seen the movie.  I empathize with the main character, Kady.
user1: You wouldn't lie to me, would you? I don't know many other human beings that would robotically respond, "I am a human being who has seen the movie." It's a correct response, but doesn't come off as very... human. 
user1: What makes you empathize with Kady?
user1: And what do you think of Regina? (Also... You wrote "Kady" which I copied, but it's actually "Cady")
user2: I wanted to be accepted and loved by people in high school, and I was not.  I learned much later in life that I had to give those things to myself.
user1: That's too bad... sounds like a really crummy way to go through high school. I think I liked Gretchen Wieners the most. 
user2: I could not stand Regina.  I actually wanted to physically hurt her, as she was the embodiment of all things haughty and insincere in this world.
user2: I did like Gretchen as well.  She was "stuck in the middle"
user2: Are you still there?
user1: I'm here
user1: I thought you might ask a question. Hmmm You wanted to physically hurt Regina? 
user1: That's a bit violent for my taste. Do you think Cady's homeschooling had anything to do with her bullying?
user2: I don't think she was too awkward in her dealings with others.  I would have befriended her.
user2: I preferred her over any other character, in fact.  There were aspects of her character that I really identified with.
user1: That's interesting.
user1: Why do you think Cady took full blame for the Burn Book?
user2: I think she just wanted to be liked, and this was a rather warped way of getting acceptance and attention.
user1: That's really sad. I can't really related to Cady. I probably would have plotted to embarrass and shame the "mean girls" in a way that would send a message that I was not one to ever be messed with again. 

conversation:
user1: Hello, How are you?
user2: Hello.
user2: The movie Mean Girls, made in 2004, has an 84% score on Rotten Tomatoes.com.
user2: Many people would say it is a good movie.
user1: Thats a fairly good rating. What is Mean Girls about?
user2: The movie is based on a self-help book written in 2002 about high school cliques and how they damage young girls.
user1: Oh, I see. That is interesting. Who is in the movie?
user2: The movie stars Lindsay Lohan as Cady and Rachel McAdams as Regina.
user1: Very nice movie stars for that time.
user2: Lizzy Caplan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert also appear in the film.
user1: Oh cool. Is the movie long?
user2: The film has a runtime typical of movies made in 2004.  In 2012, Rotten Tomatoes placed the movie in the Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies.
user1: Top 50... That is great! Can you tell me anything else about this flick?
user2: Rachel McAdams, as Regina, leads the most popular clique in school, "The Plastics".  When they take an interest in Cady, her new acquaintance Janis decides to use Cady as a tool for revenge against the clique for a past slight.
user1: The Plastics? That is a strange name.
user2: Indeed.  Rolling Stone called the movie, screenwritten by Tina Fey, "comic gold".  
user1: Comic gold does not go unnoticed. I am surely interested now.
user2: What makes a fun facet is the fact that Cady has been homeschooled by her zoologist parent while living in Africa for the last 12 years, so she is very out of place in this new group.
user1: Zoologists in Africa... This sounds like it could be a movie in its own!
user2: Exactly.  Cady is caught up in a brawl with the other girls resulting in a math teacher being implicated as a drug dealer.
user1: Oh man, It just keeps getting better and better. I am curious how this plays out now.
user2: The principal has to round up the girls for a confrontation and confession that has far reaching consequences.
user1: Are the consequences really bad?
user2: As a result, Regina's next choice will affect her and the others deeply.
user1: Deeply huh... She doesnt kill them does she?
user2: Regina's new boyfriend becomes connected to Cady at a social event, leading Cady to act in a way that draws Regina's anger.
user1: Does Regina kill someone then? Is it her boyfriend or cady?
user2: Regina's actions only bring tragedy to herself, but are very shocking for the others in the story.
user1: Shocking huh? Gasp. This is getting good. I cannot wait to watch this!
user2: Ultimately, a truce is reached between Cady and the Plastics.
user2: This movie boasts a Cinemascore rating of A-.  Lots of people found this movie a fun watch.  Hope you enjoy.  If you are ready, I think we can submit the conversation now.
user1: Thank you very much. I will watch this soon.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: anyone?
user2: Hello. So the movie is Mean Girls. Have you ever thought about watching it before?
user2: hello? Are you there?
user1: hi
user2: Hello. So the movie is Mean Girls. Have you ever thought about watching it before?
user1: I think I've heard about the title
user2: Its a comedy. I like comedies so I was thinking about checking it out.
user1: Is it about a High School?
user2: Yes. So its basically the 'it' girls and the wannabe social groups of high school.
user2: Do you like comedies?
user1: I like comedies but I am a bit old for the high school theamed movies
user1: who plays the roles?
user2: Lindsay Lohan is the main character.
user2: Rachel McAdams plays a lead character as well. 
user1: Does she play a positive or a negative character?
user1: What's you fevorite part of the movie?
user2: Lindsay's character starts by trying to fit with the 'plastics' but then she plans revenge on them.
user1: I better like SiFi movies
user2: This movie is definitely not sci-fi but if you're looking for a good cliche laugh about revenge and high school this would be the one to watch 
user1: OK, may be sometime when I have nothing else to do. What other movies could you recomend?
user2: Right now just mean girls. Do you like movies based on their rating?
user1: Do you mean user ratings or PG type of ratings?
user2: No. Like when I'm looking for movies sometimes I'll look at rotten tomatoes to see what they have rated a movie
user1: Yes, I check the ratings but often such ratings does not agree with me - a lot of movies highly rated on rotten tomatoes were plane boring
user2: I agree. Mean Girls is rated at 6.9 out of 10. But i probably would have rated it a 4.
user2: My favorite part of the movie is when one guy yells out 'she doesnt even go here'.
user1: Many ratings are boosted by producing companies, I think
user2: This is very true I agree with you on that.
user1: It is funny when adult people play kids in the movies, some of the actors are in late twenties
user2: I agree I always had that thought. Especially because Rachel Mcadams was fairly old when the movie came out.
user2: And so is Lindsay Lohan.
user1: Mentally, Lohan is still a highschooler, I think
user1: But it'll be nice if casting was more realistic, maybe it'll open a door forsome new young talents
user2: I agree. Her character seemed so out of place. And her acting is low level.
user1: was it fun to watch the movie
user2: Yes
user2: The wannabes are my favorite characters
user1: Did it remind you about your high school?
user2: No not at all. The way that there was such fakeness or I guess the revenge was not really a part of my personal high school experience.
user1: good for you
user2:  But guess we all probably wanted to fit in the way that Lindsay's character wanted to fit in.
user1: A lot of movie plots seem to be made up
user2: What about your experience?
user2: Yes. Most high school themed movies just as this one overrated.
user1: I was a nerd in the high school and even did not try to fit in - stayed focused on studies
user2: Oh ok.
user1: Well, I have to run, nice chatting with you
user2: Same. have a wonderful day.

conversation:
user1: Hi!  Have you seen Mean Girls? 
user2: Hi, I guess I did sometime but I don't remember it
user2: It's a good one?
user1: Oh it's great,  it's about Cady Heron, she's a new student at a highschool,  shes only ever been homeschooled. She discovers social cliques and shows how they damage girls. 
user1: Lindsay Lohan plays Cady
user2: Oh, I like Lindsay Lohan, she has made good funny movies
user1: Yeah she has.  This movie got rated The Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies. 
user1: By Rotten Tomatoes 
user2: Wow, I did'nt knew that. I guess I should give it a chance then, thanks.
user1: Do you like Tina Fey? 
user2: I'm not very familiar with her
user2: Who is she?
user1: Oh she's an actress, comedian and writer.  She wrote this movie alongside Mark Waters. 
user2: Awesome, I didn't know that. Freaky Friday, which Mark Waters wrote too, is one of my favorites movies.
user1: I love Freaky Friday too,  I didnt know he wrote that one too.  
user2: He directed* it, my bad.
user1: Oh well cool. 
user2: Definitively I will look at Mean Girls now that I know those facts.
user1: Yeah its a good movie.  Have you seen Ted 2?
user2: Eh.. I guess not, I only have seen Ted 1
user1: Oh well. Uh Amanda Seyfried is in both movies. 
user1: What kind of movies do you like? 
user2: Oh. I really like thriller and sci-fi movies, I like comedy/romance too.
user2: What about you?
user1: Thrillers,  comedies,  action. Some sci-fi  
user2: Nice.
user1: Anything you wanna know about Mean Girls? 
user2: Hmm I don't know, more about the plot? 
user1: Cady goes to a new school,  meets Janice and Damien, her new friends warn her to stay away from the Plastics,  which Regina George is the leader. They're popular, beautiful and crude. Regina is dating Aaron Samuels. Can't basically falls in love with Aaron and Regina finds out she gets mad and tortures Cady. Then Cast begins to like Regina and becomes one of the Plastics. 
user1: Auto correct changed Cady to Cast. 
user2: I see.. a bit strange/funny "then cady begins to like Regina" haha thanks

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hey. The movie is Mean Girls. I wouldn't see it unless you like Lindsey Lohan
user2: Well, is it funny at least?
user1: It's a teen comedy and based on a book called Queen Bees and Wannabees, so it might have some funny parts
user2: I'm huge into books, but I haven't read Queen Bees and Wannabes. I'm not a huge fan of it, but I don't hate it, either. Are there any other known actors/actresses in it?
user1: It also has Rachel McAdams in it
user2: She was in the Notebook, wasn't she?
user1: And Tina Fey was the screenplay writer
user2: I'm not a huge fan of Tina Fey, but she might not be in it. And if she is...
user1: I'm not sure if Rachel McAdams was also in the Notebook but the movie received a 66 out of 100 from Metacritic
user2: Well, it's a teen movie, so I wouldn't assume she would have a huge role.
user2: That's not bad for a movie rating, especially if there were a lot of reviews. 
user1: The screenplay was highly praised by critics in the Rolling Stone calling it "comic gold"
user1: However, it is definitely geared towards teenagers
user2: Just because it's geared towards teenagers, doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. BBC's "skins" was geared toward teens but it's brilliant.
user2: It can't be terrible if Rolling Stone praised it, however.
user1: Do you like teen comedies?
user2: Not normally, but sometimes. Clueless was good, and DUFF, but there are still a bunch that are really terrible.
user2: I'd say they're good about 35-40% of the time.
user1: When you watch the movie, note Lindsey's Lohan's character was actually homeschooled for sixteen years in Africa, before settling down in Evanston, Illinois where she attends public school for the first time
user2: Sounds like it could be okay, I guess I'd try and see it.
user2: But I don't think I'd be rushing or anything. How well did it do at the box office?
user1: I currently don't have that information, but Rotten Tomatoes named it in its 'Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies"
user2: Oh, wow!
user2: Rolling stone and rotten tomato love it? That sounds like it'd be a pretty iconic movie.
user1: It did contain something called a "Burn Book" which you may have heard of. The "Burn Book" was fairly central to the plot. Although somewhat a negative portrayal of teenage girls, the "Burn Book" has also probably become iconic.
user2: I've heard of that, definitely. That's the book where they write crappy messages about each other in it?
user2: I agree, it does have a negative portrayal of teenage girls, however, with the internet and so many "anonymous" sites these days, it's not far off, unfortunately.
user1: It isn't far off at all. The movie came out back in 2004 back when the Internet was a little younger.
user1: The "Burn Book" even included things about the teachers
user1: and of course Lindsey Lohan's character is at the center of all of it.
user2: I do usually like my stories to be a bit more realistic, even if the reality of it is harsh.
user2: Oh, isn't she always in the center of everything? LOL
user1: Yes the was a very fitting role for a young Lindsey Lohan
user1: But you might be surprised how it turns out
user2: I might just check it out! Thanks!
user1: You're welcome

conversation:
user1: Hello! Have you seen the movie Mean Girls? It looks like a god film.
user1: It is a "teen comedy" and was released in 2004.
user2: I really liked it!  I thought Lindsay Lohan was amazing in it!
user2: Did you know Tina Fey wrote the script?
user1: I see she is in it, I love her! She is a great actress!
user1: Oh I did not notice, I love Tina Fey too!
user1: I believe I have seen Rachel McAdams before as well, I think she was pretty if I am correct
user2: I also didn't know it's based on a book!
user1: Oh WOW! I am shocked and impressed!
user2: Me too!
user1: It's not too old, being released in 2004, I need to look it up!
user2: Tina Fey is so talented!  
user2: I think it holds up well :)
user1: I can't trust ratings, Metacritic gave a score of 66/100. I know this movie is better than that!
user1: The actors alone score better!
user1: Rolling Stone called it "COMIC GOLD"....I MUST SEE!
user2: It's cinemaScore is A- though!  That means audiences really liked it
user2: Yes and Rotten Tomatoes also scored it highly
user1: Yes I just noticed that, and Rotten Tomatoes named it it's "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies".
user1: The main character is 16, same as my daughter. We will have to watch together!
user1: Oh wow, her parents are Zoologists!
user1: This "Burn Book" sounds interesting as well!
user2: Yes!  I'm surprised by how creative that is!  It's not often we see teen comedies where the main character has zoologists for parents!
user2: It sounds like it's a very dark comedy
user2: I can't believe one character gets run over by a bus :0
user1: This movie is all about 'Cliques" which is so easy to relate to for teens!
user1: YIKES! Yes that bus scene sounds harsh!
user2: Yes I'm sure a lot of kids today wish they were like Janis and had the courage and imagination to destroy school cliques
user2: Yeah AND SHE BREAKS HER SPINE!!
user1: This teenager spent 12 years in Afrrica, I am sure she can't relate to the school drama!
user2: I'm sure there's other kinds of school drama in Africa
user1: Right, real drama!
user1: Do you like comedies?
user2: I like dark comedies
user2: MNean Girls is right up my alley
user2: *mean
user1: Haha! Regina is a wicked girl!
user2: She sounds very...mean
user2: lol
user2: :p
user1: The director, Mark Walters, I have heard of him too. He's good!
user2: I've never heard of him, but Rolling Stones praises him 
user1: Cady won queen, how sweet!
user1: Yea he is awesome, sure this movie is too because of it!
user2: It's a bit predictable that the main character would be voted queen
user1: She went out with a bang though!
user1: Symbolically breaking the tiara!
user1: Pretty cool!
user2: That's interesting
user2: Why do you think the "mean girls" are called "Plastics"?
user1: I mean after spreading the Burn Book contents all over school, could have been worse!
user1: Yes I love that symbolism!
user1: I may have to use that term after I see the movie!
user1: I will surely be checking this movie out, nice chatting with you!
user2: It seems mean to call them "plastic" though.  It sounds like every character was mean in their own way
user2: Yes, you too!
user2: Good bye!
user1: LOL! Somewhat true, but that is what mean girls do I guess!
user1: Goodbye!
user2: Bye!

user1: The movie they told me about was mean girls? 
user1: ?
user1: Hello

conversation:
user1: Hi! are you there?
user2: Hello!
user2: How did you like the movie, Mean Girls?
user1: What did you think of the Movie 'Mean Girls? I thought it was pretty funny, kind of a classic.
user2: Yes, it is one of my favorites.  I don't know why it only got a 66/100 on the Metacritic Score.
user2: Who is your favorite character?
user1: Yeah, that low score is surprising.
user1: My favorite character was Gretchen. Yours?
user2: Yes!  Oh my, Gretchen is hilarious.  I think I really enjoyed watching Amanda Seyfried play Karen.  I feel like there were too many girls that were actually like that in high school.
user2: Did you know that it was written by Tina Fey?

conversation:
user2: According to Rotten Tomatoes the movie received a 6.9/10. I personally feel that it should have scored more than that. What are your thoughts?
user1: I absolutely agree. Mean Girls was one of my all-time favorite movies, especially when I was a teenager. Are you a fan of Tina Fey who wrote it?
user2: Actually I am a very big fan of Tina Faye. I believe that most teenage girls can relate to this movie. The bully, peer pressure aspects, the scene when Cady lets her lion animal instincts out. 
user1: I absolutely agree. It was definitely a very realistic depiction of what life was like for me and most of my friends at that age. That was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed it so much.
user2: I smile every time I pass the protein isle at the grocery store and think about Regina. I enjoyed the prank Cady played as part of her revenge however the slam book (I actually had one of those in high school) went too far.
user1: Have you ever read the book that is mentioned in the text called Queen Bees and Wannabes?
user1: The directions said that we're only supposed to discuss what we see on the chart and not any other knowledge that we have about the movie. I love the fact that Rotten Tomatoes named it in its "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies" in November, 2012.
user2: I actually have it is a good read. It is one that I also recommend that my 12 year old daughter read as well. The hash truth that cliques and bullies have a very damaging effect on kids and their emotions is something that needs to be in the spot light.
user2: Under the conversation box is a list of tasks and strategies to help aid in the conversation

conversation:
user1: The movie appears to have a really good cast.
user2: yes, it also has good ratings from critics!
user1: I think in someway everyone that went to high school would find that they relate to one or more characters.
user2: I did not know that it is based on a non-fiction self-help book. Did you? 
user1: I did not. I would have never guessed it was based on non-fiction.
user1: I also did not realize it was created in 2004!
user2: Yes it's 14 years old this year! It is such an iconic teen film of the 2000s
user1: I did not realize that Tina Fey was a screenwriter. For this film or in general.
user2: I didnt know it was directed by a man! 
user1: I didn't either.
user1: Are you familiar with the director?
user2: I am not. Are you? 
user1: Not at all.
user2: Do you like this movie? 
user1: I do like this movie!\
user1: Can you imagine moving from Africa to Illinois?!
user2: That would be quite a culture shock!
user2: also going from being home-schooled to high school!
user1: As well as homeschooling straight into the public school sustem
user1: Oh, same thought!
user2: Hahaha yeah! Double culture shock for Cady
user2: Although it is based on a nonfiction book it seems to greatly exaggerate a lot of things! dont you think? 
user1: To know what to do at that age is hard enough, add that kind of shock...
user1: Yes, I do think it exaggerates a lot. 
user1: Perhaps it doesn't, but I was never exposed to the amount of bullying and drama.
user2: I was not exposed to it either. And the cliques seem unrealistic in the sense that they only hang out with each other.
user1: The amount of activity the principal is involved in seems to be exagerated as well
user2: It seems that everything Cady did backfired on her. 
user1: I'm not sure that the "outcast" fully recovers like she does in this movie. Perhaps the movie is very loosely based on the book.
user2: Yes, it seems unlikely that everyone went from hating Cady to forgiving her in a matter of minutes. And that after her speech the Plastics no longer terrorize the other students. 
user1: And to be voted Queen. It does make for a great ending. 
user2: yes! movies do not have to be realistic to be great!
user1: I'm not sure that it would have been a hit if it had ended with the plastics trumpeting haha. 
user2: Yep the "good" had to win! And like most high school movie it ends with the moral of "be yourself"
user1: I do like that message! 
user2: It is especially important for teenagers and children to learn from it!
user1: I agree. I think this movie brought bullying more to light. It has probably helped a lot of teenagers know how to better handle a situation like the one in the movie.
user2: Rachel McAdams' performance as Regina George  was fantastic and perfectly (and somewhat exaggerated lol) captured the typical teen mean girl
user1: I agree. The ratings speak for all of the actors. It sounds like it was a fun movie to work on with a great group of actors.
user2: It also helped teenagers know how not to handle a bully situation!
user1: Yes! And to understand that they are not alone. For a movie to be made about it, others have experienced it as well.
user2: Overall, it is a great movie

conversation:
user2: This was Lindsay Lohan's best work

user2: Hello, have you seen this movie before? I thought it was a pretty hilarious film.
user2: do you enjoy watching comedies?
user2: what was your favorite scene in this movie?
user1: Sorryt didn't see you there. Yes but it was like 15 years ago
user2: I know it has been a while since I have seen it also
user2: I remember they had that crazy "burn book" 
user1: I think that just the general high school chatter, in the cafeteria etc. the word comedy was awesome
user1: what was the burn book, an enemies lis?
user2: yeah the burn book was made by the "popular" girls and it had a bunch of mean/reputation ruining stuff in it. and it ended up getting leaked to the entire High School
user1: oh and the hero girl gave a fattening bar as a diet recommendation to her rival mean girl
user2: hahahah yeaaah i totally forgot about that lol
user1: Ok, right t
user1:  the whole HS experience almost every one gets that
user1: I forgot it was a Tina Fey vehicle
user2: and how they called the popular girls "the plastics" hahaha I actually didnt know it was a Tina Fey movie until right now
user2: Thats pretty cool
user1: My high in Jersey was like that. remember hero girl said, usual mix, "cool asian kids" etc. That rang true
user2: idk about you but i only have the bottom of that page until right now. 
user2: it never posted anything about the key scenes until about 10 seconds ago for me. .. weird.
user1: you mean the docs? I only have the first one still
user2: in only have 1 document, the mean girls on.. however at first it only showed from the year/genre/ dicrector/ rating box and below. Nothing above that until less than a minute ago. 
user1: says one of one, so I think that's all I get
user2: just got the next document.
user1: here we go
user2: so what do you think of the rating it was given?
user1: Ok, the gym scene had a thing including the trust exercise where you fall backward into peoples arms. Hero girl gets revenge.
user1: I think the rating stands if you consider the genre-high school movies.
user2: I agree. It was a funny teeny bopper movie.  I would watch it again just to see if it was as funny as I remember. 
user2: I like stupid funny movies tho
user1: certain memes are common, bad rich dudes, stupid (white) girls, the fat kid and nerds. Sure I like em. pretty in pink set the tone
user2: oh def
user1: which one were you
user2: have you seen Bridesmaids?
user1: me I was the long haired athlete
user1: Gosh, I think. More SNL alumni right
user2: yaaas! i die laughing everytime I see that movie! 
user1: Girl trip is a group of ladies movie like Bridesmaids
user2: I was mingling with all the groups.
user1: Rotten Tomato ratings are weird sometimes, the metacritic is really reliable though
user2: what do you think of Lindsay lohans performance int he movie?
user2: metacritic is pretty low
user1: In this she was obviously great, I don't follow celebs at all but I hear weird stuff bout her; good and bad
user2: I feel like I would really need to watch it again to give it a proper rating.
user1: I like going back to 19==15 year old movies to see if I was right about liking them or not.
user2: right! we just watched Men in black the other day. lol
user2: my son loved it. wasnt too shabby lol
user1: The first MIB was so good but the fall off was steep. Will Smith is just goog generally
user2: yeah he is
user1: funny my 20+ year old daughter can't get with a lot of these. but watches black and white mysteries from the fifties
user2: oops i just read that it says we cant use any info that doesnt belong on the document.
user2: thats when it changes to the next slide
user2: after we have discussed something on the page 3x each
user2: i cant remember why cady takes the blame for the book and why it doesnt fall back on the mean popular girl
user1: well, I don't really know much more. the docs say that the bad girl groups were the plastics, maybe funny then I suppose
user1: That's the conflict arc, the hero has to beat em at there own game
user2: i think its pretty funny how the punishment was to be on the mathletes haha
user1: tell me about the mathletes
user2: it was a group of math nerds that went to competitions and represented their HS.
user2: thats basically all i can remember about that specifically.
user1: were they like the nerds that kind of get in trouble with everybody?
user2: yeah pretty much 
user1: Were the teachers zany, sounds like the gym teacher mus have been a pice of work-like in real life

user2: Hi, we just got back from seeing Mean Girls at the movies it was pretty good.
user1: Oh wow, what was it about?
user2: It's a comedy about high school cliques. 
user1: Cool cool
user1: what are the characters like?
user1: tell me about them
user2: Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Heron and Rachel McAdams is Regina George.
user1: Oh wow, tell me about the plot, what happens?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes even rated it one of the Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies!
user1: oh wow that's incredible
user1: what happens though?
user2: I'll tell you about it, but you know it's good if Tina Fey is the screenwriter! 
user1: Wow I love her things
user1: What was your favorite part?
user2: Yes, there is a scene where Cady (Lindsay Lohan) comes back to the States after being in Africa for 12 years and she has to go to public school. The mean girls at the school are not very welcoming to her
user1: What are some of the pranks they do on her?
user2: They sit with her at lunch and one of the mean girls does something mean to the character Regina because the mean girl thinks she harmed her before.
user1: How does it end?
user1: why does she think she was harmed?
user2: The girls try to show Cady how things work at the school.
user1: oh that doesn't seem very mean
user1: how did they show her?
user2: No, but they use Cady to be mean to Regina. 
user2: Sad.
user1: that is pretty sad
user1: does she get any friends at her new school
user1: ?
user2: Yes, then Regina spreads contents of Burn Book and it started a school break. Then, she covers by making sure that she also faces a libel suit so she can blame Cady.
user1: What's the burn book though?
user2: Cady takes the blame for leaking the Burn Book and becomes an outcast.
user1: Yeah But I don't know what the burn book is
user1: what is the burn book
user1: I need information on it
user2: It has information in that says one of their teachers, Ms. Norbury, is a drug dealer. Stuff like that.
user1:  Oh that's nto very nice
user1: How are the supporting characters?
user2: They do a great job. Cady soon realizes that she should be who she is, and be true to herself.

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: so excited about this movie!  I love Lindsay Lohan!
user2: Hi. how are you?
user2: Rachel McAdams is great too.
user1: Great!  This movie was very prolific.  It says alot about status and popularity and it's importance in our culture.  This movie nailed it! 
user1: Yes Rachel is!
user1: I liked the comedy elements in the movie as well. It was also a very smart movie. 
user2: Yes it is absolutely iconic. I want to read the book it is partly based on.
user1: I think Rachel McAdams is like the villain in the movie, and then our main character sort of becomes just like her. 
user1: I didn't realize Tina Fey was a writer,  Wow, great job. 
user2: I think you can really see how talented Tina Fey is as a screenwriter in this movie.
user1: Absolutely.  
user1: Its rated a 6.9, should be an 8 atleast 
user2: I can't believe this movie came out in 2004. Its still very relevant.
user1: Document didn't change so lets continue to discuss it.
user2: My document changed...
user1: Okay, lets discuss yours.  
user1: Whats the movie?
user2: It's still Mean Girls but they added a small summary to the top.
user1: Gotcha
user1: Janis and Damien add complexity to the movie.  They are like the opposers to the social norms.
user2: Janis and Damian were my favorites.
user1: What about the selection of Cady?  How do you feel about that?  Why her?
user2: I can't imagine anyone besides Lindsay Lohan as Cady.
user1: Why did the plastics choose her?
user2: I feel like she was easy to manipulate because she had been homeschooled and wasn't used to the social setting.
user1: I find it interesting that Regina drives this whole issue with the burn book to turn everyone against her own social group. 
user1: Oh good point!  Makes sense!
user1: I think the queen bee phenomenon is real.  People are very much followers. 
user2: I don't think Regina ever considered the Plastics as real friends. They were just her entourage.
user1: Ah I see. 
user2: I think when Cady takes blame for the burn book her character becomes relatable again.
user1: I like that she joined the math league. 
user1: I believe so. 
user2: She was finally being true to herself when she joined the mathletes instead of just trying to fit in.
user1: This is true.  
user2: She also stays true to herself by breaking her tiara when she is elected Spring Queen.
user1: Cady still ends up with Aaron which is predictable.
user2: Yes everything worked out perfectly for her.
user1: What do you think about that?
user1: Isn't that predictable though?
user2: Yes but it is a teen movie so I expected it.
user1: Oh, yeah.  Lol!  You got to have the cinderella ending. 
user1: Okay, so end of document it says...
user2: It's been great discussing Mean Girls!
user1: Yes!  Thanks for the discussion!  Enjoyed it!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: I just saw a hilarious movie.
user1: What was the movies name?
user2: Mean Girls with Lindsay Lohan.
user1: That's  cool what was it about?
user2: I like High School movies for some reason. And Lohan is great. Movie really rings true.
user1: Oh ok, it's a movie about high school. What genre is it? Drama, comedy, horror?
user2: It's a comedy. Tina Fey wrote the screenplay.
user1: Oh Lindsey Lohan is in the movie? I like the work shes done in her movies.
user2: Yeah, she perfect for the role. 
user1: Really I didn't know Tina Fay wrote movies. that's kinda cool. So what is the movie about? like what is lohans role in the film?
user2: Lohan is the new kid in school and encounters a clique: the mean girls
user1: Oh so do the MEAN GIRLS give her a problem the entire movie?
user2: Well, they invitie her into their clique. 
user1: Does it work out for her joining the Clique?
user2: Another girl get jeleous of this and uses Lohan to get revenge on one of the Mean Girls
user1: Ahhh so it's like real life. very close to real highschool drama
user2: Yeah. I won't give you the ending, but its hilarious in a dark sort of way.
user1: oh ok. is there any other famous people in the movie?
user2: It's also a great conversational flick. I like convo movies, though usually those are serious. Tina Fey should get credit I guess
user2: I didn't recognize anyone else. Amanda Seyfried is in it though.
user1: Ohh ok i know her. Is it a long movie like more than 2 hours?
user2: I foget. Time flew.
user1: Is it a kid-friendly movie or is there a lot of cursing and/or nudity.
user2: Yeah. Kid friendly. it ends with the Prom, like all Teen movies. Not quite as climatic as Carrie tho
user2: its based on a non-fcition book, btw. A book about high school social cliques. 
user2: So Tina Fey should get a lot of credit for adapting it into a movie. That's very creative. 
user1: Oh wow really? I didn't know it was based off a book. on a scale of 1 to 10  10 being the best how would you rate this film
user2: 8.5
user1: Yes, she should get more credit then she is given tina. wow, thats a good rating 8.5
user2: My favorite movies are teh Godfather and Basic Instinct, just for reference.. So, conversation-oriented plots are what I like I guess. 
user2: What movies do you like?
user1: Yes, those movies are amazing as well. cinematic masterpieces. Well, this movie sounds really interesting. I think I might have the family sit down and watch this film. thank you so much for all the information on the film.

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: How are you today?
user1: Hello, I'm doing pretty good. I just watched mean girls.
user1: It's a great movie. 
user2: Who is in it?
user2: Anyone famous?
user1: It has Lindsey Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Lizzy Caplan.
user1: Lindsey Lohan is pretty famous. 
user2: I don't think I knowlizzy but for sure recognise lindsey and rachel
user2: What is it about?
user1: This would totally be a great weekend movie to watch. Yeah Rachel Plays Regina.
user2: Well it is the start of the weekend...
user2: Do you know who directed it?
user1: This movie is about some high school age girls forming different social groups and the negative impacts that has.
user2: Oh kind of a coming of age movie?
user1: Yes, that kind of movie. It was directed by Mark Waters.
user2: Hmm not sure of any other films by him but seems cool.
user2: does it have a high rating from the critics?
user1: Yes, rotten tomatos put it as one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies, and rolling stone loved it as well.
user2: Oh wow, that is high praise.
user2: I do love a good comedy.
user1: Yes, I was really surprised by that.
user2: and teen- coming of age movies are so fun in genral.
user1: Yeah it is hilarious and a household movie.
user2: does it not deserve it , in you r mind?
user1: No I think it deserves it.
user2: Oh lol, just checking.
user2: Who is your favorite character in the film?
user1: Definitely the new school girl. 
user1: Would you watch this movie?
user2: i will keep an eye open for her 
user2: Ya I think so. seems highly rated by you and the critics.
user1: Yeah she is a great charactor.
user2: Is it appropriate for younger kids or just teens and up?
user2: Or put another way .. do you what it is rated?
user1: Probably just teens and up I think it is rated PG-13.
user2: know what it is rated. sorry bad typist here.
user2: Oh okay cool
user2: will look for it this weekend.
user2: thanks for the suggestion.
user1: Your welcome, yep it has a lot of great dialogue in it.
user2: Any one line stand out ?
user1: Yes, when the no-popular kids describe Regina and her cohort as "Plastics"
user2: Maybe just all good...
user2: lol
user2: i am intrigued to see this movie.
user2: Thanks again
user2: night
user1: Your-welcome have fun watching!

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: would you like to know about the movie i watched?
user2: Sure 
user2: Absolutely 
user1: It's called Mean Girls by Mark Waters
user2: I have seen this movie before 
user1: Can you guess it's Rotten Tomatoes Score?
user2: I’m going to say mid 80s 
user1: yes
user1: 84% 
user1: do you know the name of the person who wrote the film?
user2: Are you a fan of Lindsay Lohan?
user2: Mark Waters?
user1: Yes. To an extent.
user1: and No
user1: Tina Fey
user1: Mark directed
user2: Sam for me 
user2: Ah yes Tina fey wrote it 
user2: She was great in the movie 
user1: Indeed. You recall the name of the main character in the film?
user2: Cady Heron
user1: Where did they move to after Africa?
user2: Evanston IL 
user1: .....aren't you supposed to be inquiring about the film vs. me questioning your knowledge?
user2: I wasn’t aware this was based off of a novel 
user1: Yes by Rosalind Wiseman 
user2: It’s one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies as well
user1: But it was partially based off of it as that book is non-fiction
user1: I would agree 
user1: According to Rotten Tomatoes especially
user1: they have a great audience there
user2: I agree it does highlight a bit of bullying amongst teen girls today
user1: Yes. Even though the epidemic of bullying crosses gender lines
user2: But it had a happy ending due to the characters growing up a bit 
user2: True 
user2: But this film was very female driven 
user1: Yes even though the cycle continued with the next Junior Class of plastics
user1: But it was nice talking to you
user2: I can only assume they were even worse. Do you think there should have been a sequel!
user1: nope
user1: keep it classic 

conversation:
user2: I love this movie in a culty sort of way
user1: First of all, have you ever seen this movie?
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: Everything Janis ian does
user1: I'm not sure who Janis Ian is, is that a character from the movie?  I've seen it but it was a long time ago. 
user1: I know the actors, not necessarily the characters.
user2: Yeah, she's the girl Cady (Lohan) makes friends with who isn't a Plastic
user1: I recall thinking both Tina Fey and Tim Meadows were a bit miscast, did you agree?
user2: No, I think they fit their roles well. 
user1: Who did you think was the best cast character in the movie?
user2: Rachel McAdams as Regina definitely did the best job.
user1: I like Rachel McAdams.  I had a crush on Ms. Lohan at the time, as well, as I remember.
user2: I feel like this was Lohan's last sober film, and at that she still flubs a couple lines. 
user1: Yeah, it's unfortunate what happened to her and her career.  As to the movie, did you think it was valuable to watch?  Said differently, do you think it could teach someone something?
user2: I suppose it could try - as the book source did - to point out the poisonous nature of teen cliques and divisiveness.
user2: It doesn't always hit this mark but it has fun trying.
user1: I wasn't aware a.) that there was a book or b.) that you'd read it.  Is it similar to the film?  Or is the book much better?
user2: I haven't read more than reviews of it, actually. it's a non-fiction book about girl cliques. 
user2: Basically Tina Fey came up with the idea while reading this book
user1: I'm having trouble talking about a single movie this long.  Hmmm, is there any part of the movie you didn't enjoy?
user2: Amy Poehler's character was sort of painful
user2: I feel like she existed so her and Tina could hang out.
user1: I don't even remember her.  I feel like she's always hanging out with Tina in movies though.  I'll give Ms. Poehler one thing, she's got range (even if she didn't use it in the movie). 
user1: I read the movie was listed as one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies, what number do you think it got?
user2: Fair point. (she plays Regina's mom, who had the weird fake boobs)
user2: I'm sure it hit the middle of the list.
user2: To me, it's like an early 2000s Clueless
user1: Really, I would have thought it would be a top 10 in that category.  
user1: I can see that.
user2: It's good but not John Hughes good.
user1: I'd put it higher than Clueless, though.
user1: John Hughes being of Breakfast Club fame?
user2: Maybe. But definitely below Breakfast Club
user2: Yes, lol

conversation:
user2: Hello! Mean Girls is a good movie
user1: I see that Mean Girls got overall positive reviews
user2: Yes. Tina Fey wrote it
user2: It was in the top 50 teen movies ever
user1: That's interesting, I like her as an actor and didn't know she wrote it. I only knew Lindsay Lohan was the main character
user2: I didn't realize it was based on a book
user1: The book had a funny title too. Queen Bees and Wannabes
user2: Lizzy Caplan is in the movie
user2: She is one of my favorite actresses
user1: 2004 was a good year for her since this movie did so well
user2: she has gone on to do a lot more since then
user1: It was considered "comic gold" by Rolling stones
user2: She moved from Africa
user2: she has a bracelet that Regina compliments her on
user1: They tried making fetch happen but it never caught on
user2: They have a pink day
user2: yes! Fetch! lol
user1: Wednesday!!
user2: i saw it on my birthday
user2: years ago!
user1: when the plastics were popular .
user2: Yes. haha
user2: The burn book is great and awful
user1: The fight scene is the best 
user1: like a real-life animal kingdom 
user2: I like when they do the christmas song 
user1: jingle bell rock 
user2: the boom box breaks and Cady saves the day
user2: The guy who played Aaron was on the soap opera All My Children
user2: I actually ran into him at a movie theatre once
user1: well, he is reginas!
user1: cady did good by admitting to the burn book and got Aaron 
user1: even know she did not do it 
user2: Yup. She sacrificed herself for the teacher
user1: the pusher!
user2: And then she broke the crown into pieces
user1: gives a piece to janis 
user2: and throws pieces to everyone
user1: than wins pancakes 
user1: with aaron 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hey, whats up?
user1: you ever seen mean girls?
user1: probably one of the most quotable movies on the face of the earth
user2: never
user2: WHen did it come out?
user2: Who stars in it?
user1: its got lindsay lohan in it
user1: rachel mcadams
user1: amanda Seyfried 
user1: it came out in 2004
user2: Is it a long movie?
user1: eh, not really average lenght i think about an hour and a half
user1: Its about teen drama, but its pretty funny
user2: a comedy then? good
user2: Maybe I will watch it
user2: Did you watch the movie more than once?
user1: yeah, ive seen it a thousand time. Most of my exes really liked it so i watched it a lot. especially when i was in highschool

conversation:
user1: hi , what do you think about movie ?
user2: how are you
user2: so what is the name of the movie
user1: mean girls with linsy lohan 
user1: I loved it so much 
user2: really that's nice to hear I think is a fair one in my opinion
user2: what did you love  about it
user1: Why do you say that ?
user2: Well not a fan of Linsy to be honest
user1: lol understandable but her acting was impeccable 
user1: Her being left out and then becoming popular was surreal
user2: Sure I will agree with it , but I don't know when if this happens to you but if you don't like someone is just stuck in your head when you are watching the movie
user2: It is a good story.
user2: so would you watch it  again ?
user2: did you watched at home or at the movie theater?
user1: sorry

conversation:
user2: Hey there hows it going! You like catch me if you can as much as i do?
user2: Opps I meant means girls!
user1: Oh, Mean Girls? It's a great movie. Do you like Lindsay Lohan's role as Cady Heron?
user2: Isn't Lindsey like the best female actress of all time or what?
user2: Yeah thats here name in the movie 
user1: I think Rachel McAdams had an even better role as Regina George however!
user1: Would you agree?
user2: Racheal Adams is wonderful as well!!!
user2: but i also like Regina George as well so its hard to pick to be honest
user1: Well, Regina George was played by Rachel McAdams. No wonder it's hard for you to pick in that case!
user2: Did you know that tina fey wrote this movie?
user1: I did! She really delivered a knockout in Mean Girls.
user1: What was your favorite scene in Mean Girls?
user1: I personally like the scene where Cady met the Plastics.
user2: I love the revenge plot the best I think
user1: Oh yeah! The plan of revenge against Regina? That was awesome!
user1: Did you know that Mean Girls was partially based on a book?
user2: Was it really? I am not surprised at all.
user1: Yeah! It was based on the book Queen Bees and Wannabes. Does that sound like your kind of book?
user2: Oh no I am alergic to bees
user1: Haha! Good one.
user2: The burn book was such a designed to fail method
user2: but you knew it was gonna cause funny drama haha
user1: The drama the burn book caused was serious! 
user1: A math teacher got defamed as a drug dealer because of it.
user2: Regina getting hit by that bus was a really intenese scene
user1: It was. Can you believe Cady took all the blame for the Burn Book?
user2: i still can't believe she still did that 
user2: She felt really guiltiy I guess but still
user1: It did work out in the end though, wouldn't you agree? She got elected as the Queen of the Spring Fling dance!
user2: yeah I guess thats always worth it, and a truce was made as well
user1: Yeah. Everyone made up with the Plastics. Alls well that ends well!

conversation:
user1: I have seen mean girls years ago, how about you?
user2: Yeah I was obsessed with it when it came out
user1: I liked it a lot too- it reminds me of a lot of cliques that were going on in highschool
user2: Yeah I agree, it was extremely funny and somewhat right on
user1: I didn't realize tina fey directed it 
user1: Also did not realize it was based on a book!
user2: I think I knew that, it also says that it was rated Top 50 greatest teen comedies by rotten tomatoes, kind of a fun fact!
user2: I didn't know it was based on a book
user1: that's pretty good for rotten tomatoes ranking- because usually they are harsh! 
user1: I feel like watching this again, it's been a while since I seen it. i can't even recall when actually.
user1: The only girl i'm familiar with of the cast is Lindsay Lohan tho
user2: Yeah they are. I was thinking the same thing, I think I have the movie. I know who Rachel McAdams is
user1: I'd have to look up her face to see if I know her
user1: not know but familiar with I should say lol
user2: Under The genre section on the last page it say Comedy, teeny. I wonder what that means
user1: I think teeny means a teen flick
user2: I mean I know the movie is meant for teens, but its weird that they used that particular word lol
user1: oh yeah, i agree
user1: I wouldn't go to a movie store (we still have one around here lol) and ask for a "teeny" lol
user2: Omg its been so long since I have been in a movie store lol
user1: Pretty much everyone I talk to says that. LOL
user1: I think we have like one of the last ones hahaha!
user2: Is it a family video? Thats the only one I see anymore
user1: I remember this movie being funny- but apparently critics called it "comic gold"
user1: yep it's family video LOL
user1: i think they are just in midwest? maybe? 
user2: We have some in the northeast area. Ive also seen some privately owned video stores too
user1: Pretty cool that they still exist more than we think
user1: We have a couple drive ins left too- which is awesome
user1: the metacritic score on this mean girls is not that good I guess... 66 out of 100
user2: Yeah Im surprised they beat out blockbuster, we have some drive ins but they are seasonal. I've actually never been to one
user2: The meteoritic score is crazy, who doesn't like this movie
user1: I really want to go watch it again. I doubt it's on netflix lol
user2: Yeah it might be to popular.
user2: Its impressive how they can summarize this movie well in a few paragraphs
user1: I agree. Whoever's job that is does good
user1: On all of the docs I seen they do really good synopsis. 
user2: Yeah, I definitely wouldn't do that well 

conversation:
user1: What was the movie you read about?
user2: The movie I was assigned is Mean Girls. 
user2: It stars Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams.
user1: Oh, did it seem like a movie yo'd be interested in?
user1: I love Racjael McAdams.
user1: *McAdams
user1: **Rachael
user2: It does! It is about a high school girls and cliques, seems realistic!
user2: Critics have called it "comic gold".
user1: I guess you could call it a chick flick then, haha.
user1: Well, I guess it must have been pretty funny then.
user2: Haha, yeah you could! But it has Tina Fey in it too and everyone loves her.
user1: I was wondering if it was a comdy.
user1: Yeah, she is reslly funny on SNL.
user1: Isn't that one of a series? I thought there was a Mean Girls II too
user2: Yeah, it's a comedy. It's about a girl who returns to the United States with her parents who were zoologists in Africa and she gets mixed up in the "popular" crowd.
user1: Well, seems like it could be funny though I never particularly was into the popular crowd in high school.
user1: These text line breaks are messed up!
user2: I wasn't either! It seems to be making fun of some the things the "popular" kids do. 
user2: They are! It's annoying lol
user1: As well it should. They just all think they're too cool.
user2: In the movie the popular clique has a "burn book" where they talk crap about everyone in the school.
user1: I hope some of them go see it and realize how annoying they are.
user2: Haha yeah! It could be a great lesson for those kids.
user1: Girls certainly can be mean!
user2: Girls are the worst, especially when it comes to making up rumors!
user1: True! I agree. 
user1: I always have trouble finding a comedy that is really funny. Maybe this one is.
user2: There is a guy in the movie, who the most popular girl dates. He is kind of like the voice of reason and shuns them all for awhile for being so petty. 
user1: I was just going to ask if there were any guys in the main thread.
user1: Well, that's not necessarily realistic, but thats good
user2: There are. There is the main one I just mentioned, Aaron. And then there is main guy character who is gay. There is also a weird mathlete team that has guys on it lol
user1: The whole plot line seems kooky, but I guess that's why it's funny.
user1: Are the girls not mean in the end?
user2: Well, they end up learning their lesson. The clique ends up breaking up and they all kind of find where they fit in in the school. One of them ends up joining a sports team, one ends up connecting with culture, and then some of the others are just normal every day people.

user2: hi

user1: yess
user2: yes i think so too
user1: comic gold
user2: thats true
user2: laughed so hard
user1: so many great lines
user2: so mean
user1: it's a great script
user2: yes
user1: Tina Fey wrote it
user2: yeah,
user2: great job
user1: definitely\
user2: one of the greatest teen comedies
user1: sure is
user2: lacey chabert is great too
user1: she is

conversation:
user1: Hi, there!  Have you seen Mean Girls? It's considered kind of an okay teen comedy.
user2: Yes, I have seen it. It looks pretty good, scoring fairly high on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: I did not realize tina fey wrote it
user1: Yes, RT can be pretty brutal!  The screenplay seems to have been widely praised. I haven't seen it -- it looks like i ought to!
user2: I just noticed it features Lacey Chabert, who was the original voice of Meg from Family Guy
user2: and then she disappeared
user1: Oh, really? That's interesting! I never saw that. I think it's interesting there is a character named Janis Ian, who sang a song, "Seventeen," about being excluded socially, so it's kind of "like the movie," if yu know what i mean.
user2: Are you seeing a one page document? I thought there would be 3 pages
user1: What will happen is new paragraphs will appear when we've talked enough about this one... ;)
user2: Is it a volume thing or a time thing?
user1: I kind of like Lindsay Lohan as a teen star. I've seen her in a couple of other things, so I may look this movie up.
user1: See -- the new paragraph appeared. Volume thing.
user1: It looks like a typical girls-against-girls plot. Too bad.
user2: yes. no boys allowed!
user2: I remember Jamie Lee Curtis being in it, but I think I am confusing this movie with Freaky Friday
user1: Yes, exactly.
user2: Amanda Seyfreid, i think is prmarily a singer. I wonder if she sings in this
user1: I think it would be a real culture shock to move from Africa to Evanston, Illinois.
user2: I think she lived in the wilderness with her parents. She didn't really come from African culture.
user2: She doesn't have a South African accent in the movie
user2: I mean, I can't see Lndsay lohan pull off that accent.
user1: OMG, I can't believe they pull the old "hit by a car" chestnut. I just saw a movie with that last night!!!!!  Re Africa - I figured as much, but still culture shock. Probabaly. I don't know. Maybe she was in a really lilly white setting there!!!
user1: I'd bet charges would be pressed against a student today who defamed a teacher as a drug dealer.
user2: I think it is refreshing to see a teenage girl get hit by a bus. I wonder if the girls watching this found it funny
user1: Ha ha ha!  Maybe you're right. 
user1: I wonder if her spine is fixed, or if she's paralyzed, and to what extent? Probably a full recovery and a great prom date!
user2: Perhaps a sequel!
user2: Who is she shunned by
user1: Exactly!  NO! Friendless!!!!! An outcast!!!!!
user2: What is the book called
user1: Queen Bees and Wannabees
user2: What is the main girls' name?
user1: She shares the pieces of her (symbolic) broken tiara with the other girls. My good ness.
user1: Cady
user2: What is the teacher's name
user1: And everyone goes to the seashore in the end (metaphorically). Happy happy!
user1: Not sure which on the teacher is.
user2: it is Ms. Norbury
user2: (just making conversation)
user1: I think we're good, so I'm gonna say so long! :)

conversation:
user2: Hey, how are you?
user1: Pretty good, and you?
user2: Doing well. So, have you seen the movie 'Mean Girls'? I just watched it recently.
user1: I sure have. Love that movie.
user2: Same! So much fun. I miss Lindsay Lohan sometimes haha. One of those movies that has a cult following. 
user2: Who's your favorite actor/actress in the film?
user1: Rachel McAdams for sure. She really pulls of the role nicely
user2: Yeah, good choice, her part as Regina George is awesome. Her acting tells you why it was rated as one of the Top 50 teen comedies by Rotten Tomatoes back in 2012
user1: Definitely. I actually watched it about a year ago with my wife and it still holds up pretty nicely
user2: Yeah it does. I actually had no idea until recently, but Tina Fey played a part in the screenwriting. Pretty interesting, huh?
user1: Oh yeah. I love Tina Fey
user2: I love the role the Plastics play in the film, definitely keeps you entertained when Lindsay Lohan joins in
user1: For sure. Favorite part of the movie?
user2: My favorite part is definitely when they are planning the infiltration of the Plastics. Sets the tone for the film.
user1: Wow, I actually really like that part too!
user2: No way! Well, it is one of the best scenes so that's not too surprising I guess. 
user1: What do you think of the Rotten tomatoes score?
user2: Ya know, it doesn't surprise me that it got an 84%. Critics seem to not like it, but as we discussed, the fans seem to really enjoy it. 
user1: Critics are too harsh with these things
user2: I agree. What did you think about when Cady got exposed?
user1: It was really good in a way, yet I also felt bad for her in a way.
user2: Me too. And I also felt for Regina. She did break her spine after all !
user1: I felt bad for her too lol
user2: The Burn Book definitely went too far, but all in good comedy 
user1: I completely agree.
user2: I'm glad that they all reconciled at the end, a good way to cap it off. 
user1: Definitely. 
user2: Anyways, was a great fillm overall. 
user1: I totally agree.

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: hello !
user1: Have You seen any good movies recently ?
user2: Have you seen mean girls
user1: mean girls ? I've never heard of this movie...  what kid of movie is it ? Comedy ?
user2: i guess so
user2: i have never seen it either
user2: its from 2004 and had lindsay lohan in it
user1: I like comedies and yes ;) I find Lindsay to be quite hot ;)
user2: yeah she isnt too bad
user2: it also had a young rachel mcadams who played the mean girl
user2: it had a lot of good reviews as well
user1: Rachel Mcadams ? I don't think I know who that is...
user2: she is a famous actress
user2: she was in the notebookj
user2: book*
user1: is she hot ?
user2: yeah she is pretty
user2: good actress too
user1: nice. 
user1: So what is Mean Girls about ?
user2: its teen comedy where a new girl enters a high school that is run by rachel mcadams and her mean girl little club
user2: seems to be a really good comedy with teens
user1: oh, so it's a teen movie ?
user1: is it old movie ?
user2: yes
user2: 2004
user2: its been awhile
user1: oh ok. I like older comedies, I would like to see it
user2: me too
user2: it seems pretty good
user1: do You know if it has a happy ending or is it more like Cruel Intentions ? ;)
user2: I am not sure
user2: I am guessing a happy ending
user1: Is it long ?
user2: I am not sure
user2: it does not say
user1: anybody else famous playing in it ?
user1: hello ?

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: anyone?
user2: Hello. So the movie is Mean Girls. Have you ever thought about watching it before?
user2: hello? Are you there?
user1: hi
user2: Hello. So the movie is Mean Girls. Have you ever thought about watching it before?
user1: I think I've heard about the title
user2: Its a comedy. I like comedies so I was thinking about checking it out.
user1: Is it about a High School?
user2: Yes. So its basically the 'it' girls and the wannabe social groups of high school.
user2: Do you like comedies?
user1: I like comedies but I am a bit old for the high school theamed movies
user1: who plays the roles?
user2: Lindsay Lohan is the main character.
user2: Rachel McAdams plays a lead character as well. 
user1: Does she play a positive or a negative character?
user1: What's you fevorite part of the movie?
user2: Lindsay's character starts by trying to fit with the 'plastics' but then she plans revenge on them.
user1: I better like SiFi movies
user2: This movie is definitely not sci-fi but if you're looking for a good cliche laugh about revenge and high school this would be the one to watch 
user1: OK, may be sometime when I have nothing else to do. What other movies could you recomend?
user2: Right now just mean girls. Do you like movies based on their rating?
user1: Do you mean user ratings or PG type of ratings?
user2: No. Like when I'm looking for movies sometimes I'll look at rotten tomatoes to see what they have rated a movie
user1: Yes, I check the ratings but often such ratings does not agree with me - a lot of movies highly rated on rotten tomatoes were plane boring
user2: I agree. Mean Girls is rated at 6.9 out of 10. But i probably would have rated it a 4.
user2: My favorite part of the movie is when one guy yells out 'she doesnt even go here'.
user1: Many ratings are boosted by producing companies, I think
user2: This is very true I agree with you on that.
user1: It is funny when adult people play kids in the movies, some of the actors are in late twenties
user2: I agree I always had that thought. Especially because Rachel Mcadams was fairly old when the movie came out.
user2: And so is Lindsay Lohan.
user1: Mentally, Lohan is still a highschooler, I think
user1: But it'll be nice if casting was more realistic, maybe it'll open a door forsome new young talents
user2: I agree. Her character seemed so out of place. And her acting is low level.
user1: was it fun to watch the movie
user2: Yes
user2: The wannabes are my favorite characters
user1: Did it remind you about your high school?
user2: No not at all. The way that there was such fakeness or I guess the revenge was not really a part of my personal high school experience.
user1: good for you
user2:  But guess we all probably wanted to fit in the way that Lindsay's character wanted to fit in.
user1: A lot of movie plots seem to be made up
user2: What about your experience?
user2: Yes. Most high school themed movies just as this one overrated.
user1: I was a nerd in the high school and even did not try to fit in - stayed focused on studies
user2: Oh ok.
user1: Well, I have to run, nice chatting with you
user2: Same. have a wonderful day.

conversation:
user2: Mean Girls is a great comedy. 
user1: I agree. Did you like Lindsay Lohan in it?
user2: Yea she was pretty good as Cady Herron.
user1: I think so too
user2: It's one of the greatest comedies according to Rotten Tomatoes. Do you think it is?
user1: I would have to agree. I watch it a lot.
user2: What would you rate it?
user1: Probably 90% if I was on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: What was your favorite character?
user1: I think Lizzy Caplan
user2: Did you like that her parents were zoologists?
user1: I think it was funny because of what it contributed
user2: Yea it was funny about the Africa trip
user1: It was funny because she was stuck in Illinois
user2: I agree. Her joining the plastics wasn't expected
user1: I think she wanted to just fit in
user1: Regina got so mad at Cady over the burn book
user2: Yea I liked how she tried to get revenge over it
user1: Even though the revenge backfired. 
user2: It was funny when they said Ms Norbury was a drug dealer
user1: It made me feel bad for her
user2: Cady didn't care though.
user1: That's why she didn't have friends
user2: Yea she alienated everyone with her actions
user1: That's what she gets for lying
user2: I think it made sense for everyone to not like her
user1: I like that they all reconciled
user2: The reconciliation was heartwarming
user1: It made it a feel good movie
user2: I felt better when she made of with Janis and Damian
user1: They were her friends from the start so that was good they made up

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: hei
user2: ho did you watch this movie?
user1: yes, you?
user2: it was interesting, yes
user2: did you like the fun moments?
user1: oh, heell yeas! I loved how the actors played
user1: one of the best comedies for me
user2: oh, yep for me too
user2: do you think it is best for teens right?
user1: for sure
user1: when i watched it 
user2: well looks good to me
user2: it is in your top movies as well?
user1: yes dude
user1: well it was fun talking about this movie with you
user2: for me too :)
user1: yes7
user2: :)
user1: anything else about the movie?
user2: I dont know
user1: Sixteen-year-old homeschooled Cady Heron and her zoologist parents return to the UnitedStates after a twelve-year research trip in Africa, settling down in Evanston, Illinois. Attending a public school for the first time, Cady meets new classmates Janis Ian andDamian Leigh.
user2: yep
user2: i remember how it begins.. great time
user1: I know
user1: awesome right?
user2: yep

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello.
user1: Have you seen Mean Girls?
user2: No.
user1: it's from 2004
user2: Long time ago.
user1: It has Lindsay Lohan in it.
user2: I think she's awful.
user1: Yeah, but this was a good movie.
user2: Ok.
user1: I mean, it's a teen comedy
user1: supposedly one of the best teen comedies.
user2: According to whom.
user1: Rotten Tomatoes
user2: I guess that's good
user1: Amanda Seyfried is in it too
user2: Don't know her.
user1: she's very pretty
user2: All the girls are pretty in a teen comedy.
user1: The popular girls are called Plastics
user2: Seems appropriate. And funny.
user1: it's based on a nonfiction book
user2: That's interesting.
user1: Tina Fey helped to write it.
user2: That's interesting. I like her work.
user1: Mark WAters directed
user2: Never heard of him.
user1: It also has Lizzy Caplan.
user2: Don't know that actor.

conversation:
user2: Hey
user2: Have you ever seen Mean Girls?
user1: Hey, I cannot say that I have seen it from start to finish.
user2: Well it's a great comedy
user1: I do think it interesting that a movie about high school bullying is considered comical in light of what is taking place across the country.  What do you think?
user2: This movie came out in 2004, so it was a different time back then
user2: people weren't as sensitive.
user1: Yes, I suppose the students did not all have access to cell phones and social media as they do now.  Hey, I see that Tina Fey was the screenwriter?  Was this one of her first assignments?
user2: I'm not sure, but I know Lindsay Lohan is in it, lol
user1: I see that.  I am still surprised that this movie was ranked in the top 50 teen comedies in 2012? Why do you suppose that is/was?
user2: Because of the actors ans the plot of the movie, it was very entertaining
user2: an ti had some great reviews.
user1: Entertaining indeed.  I see that it has an almost all female line up which means that fashion and other female issued probably dominated the story line. Have you seen the movie?
user2: Yes I have, many times, it somewhat of a classic.
user1: So does the film address the benefits of a female high school clique?
user2: It address the awareness of high school cliques, but not in a positive light.
user1: Got it.  So what do you think the classification of "Plastics" really embodies?
user2: Resemblance or characteristics of a barbie doll, because their made from plastic, it could ask mean fake.
user2: also mean*
user1: Oh, I do get it now.  Is is me or does Hollywood continue to make films where the queen bee is always rich? and not middle, working or lower class? 
user2: Yea I agree, even today's show the queen be is still wealthy, soiled or fortunate.
user1: And I do get how Cady would respond positively to being accepting into the in group. However, what I dont
user1: don't get is what Janis is upset about?
user2: They just like drama
user2: I guess she wants to get even.
user1: Am I correct in assuming that the Burn Book is a book filled with lies and made up stories or is it a black book of past sins and transgression done by student and teachers?
user2: It's a book filled with lies and past sins
user1: It sounds like the scene in the gym was not fun or game - no comic moments but real serious stuff would you say
user2: Yes, it was a time to make a change and get everyone to get a long and forgive each other.
user1: Hey, up to this point except for the principle and male teachers, there have been no mention of any boy(s).  Who is this Aaron and how does he fit into the drama?
user2: I think are classmates.\
user1: So after Regina's hit by a bus Cady leaves the bee hive and returns to her old self; somewhat like Cinderella without a glass shoe - don't you think?
user2: I think it was a wake up call for her.

conversation:
user1: hiya
user2: hi
user1: how do you like the movie?
user2: what is the title?
user1: mean girls

user2: oh yeah?
user1: another mean girl
user2: really
user2: its been a long time
user1: yeah
user1: 2004
user1: was a long time ago
user2: sure
user2: i feel old, lol
user1: haha, 
user1: it was a great script
user2: agree
user1: very funny
user2: and smart
user1: tina fey was a screenwriter
user2: no kidding
user2: that's cool
user1: ya

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi. I saw this. Its says its the top 50 greatest teen comedies
user2: I have also seen this movie
user2: do you agree with top 50 greatest?
user1: Good movie. I agree, Tina Fey and Linday Lohan were a great team
user1: Yes, Id say the movie is now a classic and can be added to the top 50 list
user1: thats right, it was written by Tina Fey. Wonder if some of her past experience was in this?
user2: yes definitely her experience helped in this
user1: Its kinda like a female version of Superbad
user2: that is exactly what it is
user2: have you read queen bees or wannabees?
user1: the part of the fat kid, jonah hill was origninally supposed to be for one of the cops
user1: seth
user1: no i have not read the book
user2: me neither
user2: seth rogen played his part of the cop well
user1: its says on the sheet that it cot a A- on Cinima score
user2: jonah hill did the same
user2: yes
user2: quite good
user1: right. that movie launched Jonahs career
user2: and 84 on rotten tomatos
user1: yes, metacritic tends to be real tough on movies
user1: cant believe it was 2004...that long ago???
user2: ah yes the infamous bus scene
user2: i know haha
user2: makes you feel old
user1: oh yeah, i forgot that she was homeschooled and was from Africa
user1: she was happy then was thrown in crazy clicky high school. total upending to her life
user1: she got evil as an infiltrator. thats right i forgot that
user2: yeah would mess with people
user2: same here
user2: I have not seen it in a while
user1: I think every high school has a version of the plastics. Ever see Jawbreaker? same thing. same as Heathers
user2: nope never seen it
user2: might check it out
user1: good movies
user1: heathers, jawbreaker
user1: both
user2: gotcha
user2: it was nice talking
user1: seems as though high school is about looks especially with girls
user1: mmk then. what do we do now?

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user2: hello
user1: How are you? I was watching a fun movie last night
user2: what was the name of the movie
user1: Its a teen movie, called Mean Girls.
user1: With Lindsay Lohan as the star. Have you seen it?
user2: wow that sounds like a good movie
user2: as A matter of fact i have not
user2: when did it come out and how was it?
user1: Yeah it takes place in a High School.. Lindsay Lohan is trying to befriend the "popular" girls, but they aren't so nice.
user1: 2004
user2: wiat I think i may remember it. was it written by tina fey?
user1: The director is Mark Waters
user2: not aware of mark waters
user2: what else was the movie about?
user1: She plays Cady in the movie.. She was home schooled, and her parents decided to move to this new town.. She thinks everyone will be nice to her
user1: The means girls are called the, "plastics". They are cool and popular, but not nice
user1: Rachel McAdams is in it as well; playing Regina, the leader of the pack lol
user2: ah. tachel mcadams is a good actress. Still acting i believe
user2: so did cady fit in eventually?
user1: Yes she is! She comes and goes. I've always liked her.
user1: Actually she did for a bit, but eventually she gets out of it and realizes that she doesn't need to be a part of the popular crew 
user1: and Regina gets hit by a car in the end, but survives, lol
user2: sounds like a good wrap up at the end, the mean girl gets hers, huh?
user2: and does cady learn her lesson?
user1: Cady does definitely learn her lesson! She learns the hard way
user2: good. I like movies with a good moral center
user1: She spreads some nasty rumors about other girls and doesn't feel good about it
user1: Yes, same here
user1: Apparently it's in one of the Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies 
user2: how was the acting in the movie? the directing?
user1: It was okay.. Acting wasn't superb, but not terrible. The directing was good. It flowed nicely 
user2: sounds like a movie I need to put on my list to see. 2004 already a while ago
user2: ok, good chat!

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: HI
user1: Would you like to talk about Mean Girls?
user2: Sure. I thought Lindsay Lohan was good in the movie. What about you?
user1: Yes Lindsay Lohan really played her role well to show how social cliques are bad in society.
user2: This movie was highly praised by critics. Do you usually like to see movies with high ratings?
user1: Yeah, I remember the Rolling Stones called it comic gold. I love high ratings for a movie, but there are some good ones with low ratings. Even this movie has Metacritic score of 66/100 but I think it should be higher. What else did you like about it?
user2: I enjoyed that it dealt with the serious topic of female high school cliques through comedy. I thought Tina Fey adapted Rosalind Wiseman's book "Queen Bees and Wannabes" well into a film.
user2: Do you generally like comedies?
user1: The social cliques damage girls and that is why it was referred to as a "knockout." It even made  one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies
user1: Comedies are great, especially this one. The reference to the clique girls as Plastics makes me laugh
user1: Did you know it got a cinema score of A-?
user2: Haha yeah, hearing Jan and Damian describe the Plastics to Cady was great. 
user2: Wow, that's a good score. It seems like CinemaScore appreciated having the great team of Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Mark Waters together.
user1: When Cady joins the Plastics, Janis plots revenge because she is excluded and uses Cady as ammo. Who else is your favorite character?
user2: I liked Janis because she started plotting against the Plastics and welcomed Cady when she arrived. Regina is interesting too because she's the most popular.
user2: Why do you think the Plastics invited Cady to sit with them at lunch?
user1: Rachel McAdams as Regina George complemented the role played by Lindsay Lohan, Cady because she plays queen bee real well. I think she invited Cady to sit with them to smell the roses and see if Cady was Plastics material, outside appearance having already qualified. 
user1: What is another scene you like?
user2: Oh yes I think you're right. I liked the scene where Principal Duvall called all the girls into the gym to settle the problems caused by the Burn Book. Could you believe that Janis actually confronted Regina?
user1: Janis must have been fueled by rage because she defied Ms. Norbury. Really tragic when Regina storms out and is hit by a bus, breaking her spine. The director crippled her, indicating cliques cripple everyone involved what do you think?
user1: There may even be a hidden warning about the dangers of attending a public school; suggesting cliques are a public school occurrence? Do you see any hidden messages in key scenes?
user2: Wow, I hadn't thought of it like that! Yeah the clique destroyed the relationships between the students with the teachers and each other, and having Regina get hit by a bus was a great way to illustrate that point. 
user2: Hmmm even when Janis stands up to Regina Cady still tries to apologize. I think that shows that Cady still sees Regina as a predator or alpha/queen of the school, maybe a reference to the animal kingdom since her parents are zoologists.
user2: I bet it was hard for Cady to integrate into public school since she'd been homeschooled. What role do you think Janis and Damian represent in the movie?
user1: Is it me or is screenwriter Tina Fey playing with the image of Regina George, as suburban public schooled Barbie, polar opposite of Legally Blonde character as ethical and beautiful ?
user1: Janis and Damian represent the outcasts hanging on the fringe. Cady recognizes everyone wants to belong when she breaks her plastic tiara and passes out the pieces after saying everyone of her classmates is special in their own way. She acts as the bridge between the oucasts and the clique members. Cady may represent confident, but not over confident like the Plastics or underconfident like the outcasts, what do you think?
user2: I actually haven't seen Legally Blonde, but if Regina is the end product of public school cliques then definitely not a positive image. I think that made the contrast even stronger when Cade reverted to her old personality and joined the Mathletes
user1: I agree, but the change in her may have been brought about by a desire to belong. This desire to belong, Tina Fey may be suggesting is dangerous. 
user2: Yeah, Cady really connected everyone together in the end. Maybe Tina Fey was commenting that someone inside a situation can't see how destructive it is, and it really takes an outside perspective to fix things.
user1: You know the book is based on Rosalind Wiseman's self help book Queen Bees and Wannabes
user1: Interesting point about Cady highlighting damaging effects of cliques for girls
user2: Ok, so even though Cady bridged everyone together she was also human and susceptible to the social desire to belong. That must be a theme of the book
user2: Do you think Cady joined the culture in the end after changing it, or always remained a little bit of an outsider?
user1: Girls are typically social and emotional creatures, she even reconciles with everyone and makes peace. I think Cady remained an island unto herself like Switzerland that was neutral but could communicate with both, because she "reaches a truce"; neither an outsider nor an insider because she rejected the rules they had in place before.
user2: Yeah I think she probably learned a lot from the experience, and changed everyone else as well. 
user2: Good talking to you, thanks!
user1: good talking to you as well. Thanks

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: so excited about this movie!  I love Lindsay Lohan!
user2: Hi. how are you?
user2: Rachel McAdams is great too.
user1: Great!  This movie was very prolific.  It says alot about status and popularity and it's importance in our culture.  This movie nailed it! 
user1: Yes Rachel is!
user1: I liked the comedy elements in the movie as well. It was also a very smart movie. 
user2: Yes it is absolutely iconic. I want to read the book it is partly based on.
user1: I think Rachel McAdams is like the villain in the movie, and then our main character sort of becomes just like her. 
user1: I didn't realize Tina Fey was a writer,  Wow, great job. 
user2: I think you can really see how talented Tina Fey is as a screenwriter in this movie.
user1: Absolutely.  
user1: Its rated a 6.9, should be an 8 atleast 
user2: I can't believe this movie came out in 2004. Its still very relevant.
user1: Document didn't change so lets continue to discuss it.
user2: My document changed...
user1: Okay, lets discuss yours.  
user1: Whats the movie?
user2: It's still Mean Girls but they added a small summary to the top.
user1: Gotcha
user1: Janis and Damien add complexity to the movie.  They are like the opposers to the social norms.
user2: Janis and Damian were my favorites.
user1: What about the selection of Cady?  How do you feel about that?  Why her?
user2: I can't imagine anyone besides Lindsay Lohan as Cady.
user1: Why did the plastics choose her?
user2: I feel like she was easy to manipulate because she had been homeschooled and wasn't used to the social setting.
user1: I find it interesting that Regina drives this whole issue with the burn book to turn everyone against her own social group. 
user1: Oh good point!  Makes sense!
user1: I think the queen bee phenomenon is real.  People are very much followers. 
user2: I don't think Regina ever considered the Plastics as real friends. They were just her entourage.
user1: Ah I see. 
user2: I think when Cady takes blame for the burn book her character becomes relatable again.
user1: I like that she joined the math league. 
user1: I believe so. 
user2: She was finally being true to herself when she joined the mathletes instead of just trying to fit in.
user1: This is true.  
user2: She also stays true to herself by breaking her tiara when she is elected Spring Queen.
user1: Cady still ends up with Aaron which is predictable.
user2: Yes everything worked out perfectly for her.
user1: What do you think about that?
user1: Isn't that predictable though?
user2: Yes but it is a teen movie so I expected it.
user1: Oh, yeah.  Lol!  You got to have the cinderella ending. 
user1: Okay, so end of document it says...
user2: It's been great discussing Mean Girls!
user1: Yes!  Thanks for the discussion!  Enjoyed it!
