cast:
Jay Baruchel as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III: companion of Toothless, a Night Fury.
Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast, the chieftain of the Viking tribe and Hiccup's father.
Craig Ferguson as Gobber the Belch: blacksmith, a close friend of Stoick's, and training master of the young warriors.
America Ferrera as Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fellow student.

critical response:
It devotes a great deal of time to aerial battles between tamed dragons and evil ones, and not much to character or story development. But it's bright, good-looking, and has high energy
It's a thrilling action-adventure saga with exhilarating 3-D animation, a clever comedy with witty dialogue, a coming-of-age tale with surprising depth and a sweetly poignant tale of friendship between man and animal.
more coming-of-age dramedy or 'everything about your world view is wrong' message movie than it is a comedy, and that seems like a waste of a funny book, some very funny actors and some darned witty animation.
Technically proficient and featuring a witty, intelligent, surprisingly insightful script, How to Train Your Dragon comes close to the level of Pixar's recent output while easily exceeding the juvenilia DreamWorks has released in the last nine years.
How to Train Your Dragon rouses you in conventional ways, but it's also the rare animated film that uses 3-D for its breathtaking spatial and emotional possibilities.

description:
The Isle of Berk is a remote Viking village, from which dragons periodically steal livestock. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is too small to fight the dragons and instead fashions mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber the blacksmith, though his inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup believes he has shot down a Night Fury, an extremely rare and dangerous dragon. Hiccup later finds it in the forest trapped in his bolas, but finds that he cannot bring himself to kill the dragon and instead sets it free. 
Stoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, leaving Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber. Hiccup returns to the forest to find the Night Fury still there, and realizes it is unable to fly properly because of its crippled caudal fin. Hiccup gradually tames the dragon and gives it the name 'Toothless', for its retractable teeth. Hiccup makes a harness and prosthetic fin that allows him to guide the dragon in free flight. By studying Toothless's behavior, Hiccup becomes proficient in subduing the captive dragons during training. Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, but he is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success. 
Back at the village, Hiccup subdues a captive dragon in his final training test in front of his father instead of killing it, but Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking. Toothless attempts to protect Hiccup in the ensuing panic but is instead captured by the Vikings. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless is capable of locating the dragons' nest. Stoick disowns his son and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide. The Vikings expel most of the dragons but are overwhelmed by the Red Death until Hiccup, Astrid and their fellow pupils fly in riding the training dragons from the academy and provide cover fire. Hiccup almost drowns trying to break Toothless free from a sinking ship but Stoick saves them both and then reconciles with his son. Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death but Hiccup is injured in the fight. Hiccup regains consciousness on Berk where his lower left leg has been replaced by a prosthesis, and the Vikings and the dragons now live in harmony.

user1: Hello! Today we're gonna talk about How to Train Your Dragon
user1: Have you seen it before?
user2: Awesome.  No, I have not had the chance, is it good?
user1: Yes it has great ratings! It is rated 7.9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Who is in it?  Is it an animated movie?
user1: The cast includes Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, and America Ferrera
user1: They all do an amazing job, and yes it is animated.
user2: OMG Craig Ferguson is a riot!
user1: Yes he does such a great job!! The #d work is truly magical
user2: What is it about, besides the obvious of dragon training, of course.
user1: It is a coming to age story and has great friendship morals
user2: Does the dragon talk?
user1: one of the best scenes is when the dragon Hiccup is attacked by the bad guy Night Fury and rather than killing him, he sets him free
user1: Yes, all of the dragons have some lines
user2: So the dragon's name is Hiccup?
user1: Yes the two main dragons are named Hiccup and Night Fury
user2: Okay, Night Fury freed Hiccup then?
user1: Yes, i guess it was the moral of the story.
user2: Did the dragons breathe fire?
user1: Another important scene is when Hiccup's owner sees that Night Fury is hurt and can not fly. He makes him a prostectic wing and thats how he teaches him how to fly
user1: Im not too sure, but i bet they do. They probably only use it for good though since it is an animated movie aimed towards kids
user2: Which part did Craig Ferguson give?
user2: I would probably see this movie just because he is in it.  Do you think it's a good one to watch?
user2: I meant to say, Which part did Craig Ferguson play?
user1: He played Gobber the Belch, who was the training masters of the young warriors
user2: Were the warriors humans or dragons?
user1: well if you only like him then maybe no because his role is not a main role. If you like movies of the same genre then it may be a good fit.
user1: It is a great movie to watch with children
user1: The warriors were humans, and they were mostly kids. They owned and trained the dragons
user1: Do you like movies like this?
user2: I'm guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending?  Yes, I like some of them..  I don't go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though.  With the exception of the Wizard of Oz, that was a great movie, I could watch it over and over.
user1: Yes, it has a happy ending. Thats great, theres no singing in this film. I think this is a feel good film 
user1: It had great reception and even has 2 sequels
user2: Sounds like it.  I would probably like it.
user1: The fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but they are very immerssoive

user1: It has a rating of 7.9 and a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: If you didn't know it came out in 2010.
user2: Well then I guess we won't be seeing it in 3-D lol.
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: I have not seen it yet but it goes on to say that the Stock the Vast is a dragon killer and instead of killing a rare dragon he sets it free.
user2: Interesting, what is the dragon's name?
user1: Hiccup another character goes to a forest where the dragon was originally stuck and gradually tames the dragon which is a Nigh Fury.
user1: His name is toothless for his retractable teeth.
user2: That sounds cute. Maybe I can have my 5 year old see it.
user1: Absolutely Hiccup goes on to subdue a captive dragon in his final test, but does not harm it, Stoick on the other hand angers the dragon into attacking Hiccup!
user1: Did you want to know more?
user1: Do you usually watch animated movies?
user2: I would love to know more. My children love animated films
user1: Toothless the dragon comes to protect Hiccup but ends up getting captured by the Vikings...

user1: Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death but he ends up getting hurt, giving him a prosthesis and the end up living in harmony!
user2: That definitely sounds like something my five year old would like. What is the Red Death?

user1: Night Fury was the main one...the "hero" of the movie.
user1: Do you remember his name?
user2: Nope
user1: It was "toothless"! :)
user2: Don’t think I’ve seen the movie you are taking about 
user1: Oh, well you should watch it!
user2: What is it?
user1: You can watch it in 3D, or 2D.
user1: It's called "How to Train Your Dragon".
user2: Oh
user1: It's really great fun for all ages.
user2: Who is in it?
user2: Is it animated?
user1: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson...etc.
user1: Yes, it's animated.
user2: When was it made?
user1: 2010
user2: Is it a comedy or more serious?
user1: Definitely a comedy.
user1: It has some really funny parts, but serious stuff too.
user2: Interesting. As it deals with dragons 
user1: 98% on Rotten Tomatoes!
user2: How long is the movie?
user1: I'm not sure, but around 2 hours I think...probably a little less.
user2: Might have to see it. Do you recommend in 2D or 3D?
user1: Since it's animation, 3D (if you like 3D) is really great.
user1: Some other voice actors you might recognize: TJ Miller, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse
user1: It has some really cool battle scenes and a lot of "feeling" for an animated film.
user1: Any other questions? I have a document in front of me with a bunch of info about the movie...
user1: It was based upon a book.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello there, how are you today?
user1: I'm pretty good. Seems like you have the document this time. Do you have a movie you'd like to talk about?
user2: So the movie is How to Train Your Dragon, have you seen this before?
user1: I haven't but I've heard good things about it!
user1: What's it about?
user2: Well let see, It came out in 2010 and was produced by Dreamworks, it is a fully animated show.
user1: Dreamworks huh? I do enjoy a lot of their movies. I assume from the title that it has something to do with dragons?
user2: It is set back in the Viking Days, and it has a teenage character named Hiccup, who finds a wounded dragon and befiends it.
user2: befriends
user1: Oh the old boy and his dog story but with a dragon huh? That sounds pretty interesting. Was it received pretty well?
user2: The movie is a bit unique as it uses 3D animation , its a coming of age comedy, the same producers of Lilo and Stitch created it.
user2: It seemed to do ok it got a 98% on rotten tomatoes, but an A in Cinema score
user1: I see! That sounds pretty good then. You said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices?
user2: Actually some well known names come to mind, like hiccup is played by Jay Baruchel. And Gerard Butler as the chief Viking, America Ferrera plays a friend of Hiccup. Hiccup is the main character of course.
user1: That's really cool. I'm sure they do a great job. I really like animated movies so I might have to check that one out sometime.
user2: I have actually seen it and I would recommend it
user1: You mentioned that he befriends a dragon. Can you tell me anything more about that?
user2: Sure, the Dragons name is Night fury. And the movie doesn't have much of a storyline, but it has battles between tamed and evil ones.
user2: Do youlike dragons?
user1: I see, that sounds pretty interesting though. I do! Dragons are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to get a film with a good one
user1: And vikings as well. It sounds like a very unique setting.
user2: YES, The isle of Berk is their village, and they are afraid of the dragons because they steal their livestock, so when they come upon the dragons they usually kill them.
user1: Oh no! But I guess Hiccup finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end?
user2: See Hiccup is scrawny and cant fight because he is scrawny, so he makes things, apparatuses if you will.
user2: but he isnt very good at it
user1: I see, an awkward kid makes a friend of a dragon huh? That does sound very interesting.
user1: I usually like animated films that have a good main character so this might be right up my alley.
user2: SO during one of those attacks Hiccup shoots at a dragon, and believes he has shot it down. Finds it later, not dead, but damaged. Helpes the dragon fly again then finds out that thedragonsare being Bullied by a bigger one.
user1: I see! I bet he works together with his new dragon friend to help them out then.
user2: So Hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out Hiccups friendly Dragon and they all learn how to train awkward dragons and go off to fight the biggest Dragon which they call Red Death.
user1: That does sound cool!
user1: And it looks like we're done
user1: It's been nice talking with you!
user1: Have a good day.

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: hi
user1: Are you done reading the document?

user2: hiccup
user1: I like him too. But I like most is Toothless.
user2: do you remember the scene where the dragons would periodically steal live stock from the viking village
user1: Yeah, is that your most favorite part of the movie?
user2: my favorite part is when he decides that he can't kill the dragon and instead sets it free
user2: what is your favorite part of the movie
user2: the aerial battle scenes are pretty cool in the movie to.
user1: My favorite part of the movie is when Hiccup tried to tame Toothless.
user2: did you like the aerial battle scenes
user1: Yeah, that was really awesome. 
user1: Who is the director of this movie?
user2: the directors are Chris Sanders and Dean DeBois.
user1: They are really good directors.

user2: ok I never heard of him before
user2: have a good day
user1: have a nice day too

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello.
user2: do you like animated movies?
user1: Yes I do. Do you like them?
user2: i like some. i saw a good one a while back called "how to train your dragon". i really liked that one.
user1: What did you like about it?
user2: it was witty and had a great script. pixar did a really great job with the 3-d, too.
user2: i didn't even have any kids and i enjoyed it.
user1: That's cool I didn't know they did it in 3D. Sounds awesome that adults can enjoy it too
user2: yeah; it's a coming of age story about a friendship between and boy and a dragon. kind of sappy, but still a cute story.
user1: Those kinds of stories sound cliche but they're always great to watch anyway.
user2: one of the voices is done by craig ferguson - he's one of my favorite comedians.
user2: any the main character's name is Hiccup which is kind of funny.
user1: I didn't know Craig Ferguson was in it, that's cool! Are there any other famous actors in it?
user2: gerard butler, jay baruchel, jonah hill, america ferrera, kristin wilig, and christopher mintz-plasse
user2: critics rated it 74/100
user1: Wow I didn't realize it had all those people.
user1: 74/100 is pretty good for an animated movie I'd think
user1: Critics can be uptight and not appreciate animation.
user2: on rotten tomatoes it even has a 7.9/10. so i guess lots of people enjoyed it.
user1: Yeah that's good. I feel like Rotten Tomatoes gives good estimates.
user1: Have you seen the sequel?
user2: no; i haven't. :-( i'm gonna put it on my list, though. :-)
user2: the main character is a a scrawny kid and his dad happens to be the village chieftain. so i wonder if he bulks up any. lol.
user2: the dragon's name is toothless. so it's got good comical bits in there.
user1: Haha maybe! That sounds like a good relatable conflict to have in a movie though. I bet a lot of kids can relate to that whole living up to your parents' expectations thing.
user2: certainly. and the poor kid goes out to kill the dragon in the beginning but just can't bring himself to do it.
user1: Does he start out with his own dragon or does he earn one?
user2: he befriends the one he doesn't kill and lets go. his wing was hurt and he ends up making him a prosthetic so he can fly again.
user1: Oh that's right. The dragon is so cute.
user2: hiccup learns how to subdue dragons, too, calming them down.
user2: well, in the end, hiccup and his dad reconcile.
user1: Isn't taming the dragons a special skill that only Hiccup has?
user2: yeah; he's a smart kid and observes the dragons a lot to learn all of that.
user1: Did you like the settings and landscapes of the movie? Sometimes that's my favorite part of animated movied
user2: yeah, the isle of Berk and the surrounding area were so fantastical. i also liked when hiccup was flying aorund on toothless.

conversation:
user2: Hello. Did you see the movie How to Train Your Dragon?  It was so cute!
user1: Yes, I didn't know there were so many people in it.
user2: I know the cast is great!  I am a big fan of Gerard Butler
user1: He's really good.  Craig Ferguson is always good for a chuckle.
user2: Yes. The movie wasn't all fun and games though.  It was kind of a dramedy with a little bit of seriousness to it.
user2: Did you know America Ferrera was one of the voices?
user1: I did not.  She play Astrid, Right?
user2: Yes.  She's another student.
user1: The 3-D animation was top notch.
user2: I agree.  Dreamworks Animation is always on top of their game.
user1: The critics seem to agree.
user2: The scene where Hiccup shoots the dragon down is kind of sad.
user1: Lets it go though.
user2: Yes.  Hiccups inventions are always going awry.
user1: I was just thinking he pretty smart though, coming up with stuff being 15.
user2: I agree.  Very imaginative.
user1: I've gotta say it though.  Some of the names make me laugh.  Hiccup, Stoick the Vast, Gobber
user2: I know they are too funny.  Hiccup is a great nickname though.
user2: Did your description just go away?  Mine did.
user1: Nope, I'm a slow reader though.
user2: No worries.
user1: So you can't read the bit about a Caudal fin.  That's bit of toothless that tore off.
user2: I can't see it, but I remember.  Poor toothless.
user1: I've got to google that.  I really do love this movie.  98% it's nice to know I like a movie others do to.
user2: Yes.  That is a really high rating.  It has a great harmonious message at the end which is inspiring
user1: Reckon we're supposed to keep going.  Stoick straps toothless to the ship and goes off to fight the mega-dragon.  I've kind of felt that this was an old trope, but still works a bit.
user2: I think we have to remember that is is for kids.  The fight scenes are really done well.
user1: You're right.  That first critic says something about the areal battles being too much, but honestly I loved them.  I'm a grown man but still a kid at heart.
user1: Aerial* sry
user2: I agree.  The critics need to remember the child within.
user2: I knew what you meant.
user2: The finish conversation button came up.  Have a great afternoon!
user1: You too.

user2: Oh..that might be interesting to see in theater
user1: I honestly just go for the popcorn haha
user2: Maybe I will try to watch it again with him
user1: Sure give it a shot
user1: Why not?
user2: Me too! I love the popcorn!

user2: The plots sounds good and it got pretty ok reviews

user1: Hello?

conversation:
user1: Have you ever seen How to Train Your Dragon?
user2: Yes, I have it is a lovely movie
user2: It is an animation/fantasty movie that came out in 2010. 
user1: Yes it is , actually a movie I really enjoy. 
user1: Which character do you like best?
user2: It is animation that is voiced by Jay Baruchel (Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III) and  Gerard Butler ( Stoick the Vast),
user2: The movie has everything, from 3D computer-animation, to action-fantasty
user2: It is a DreamWorks Animation that was distributed by Paramount Pictures
user2: Did you know that the movie was actually loosely based on a British book series?
user1: Yes
user1: and alot different that the actual books
user1: the books are more comedy 
user2: intersting, I did not know that.
user1: Did you like the interactions with the characters?
user2: Oh yes, very much
user1: which character do you like the most?
user2: The movie is based at the Isle of Berk in a remote Viking village where there of often Dragons stealing livestock and causing toruble 
user1: I like Astrid and Gobber
user1: Toothless is my favorite dragon
user2: Toothless is a great character. Hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldn't bring himself to do it and instead sets him free
user2: He gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech
user2: It was becuase of toothless that Hiccup learned how to tame other dragons
user1: Do you think Hiccup cheats because of what he learns from Toothless ? (by using it his training class?)
user2: He become proficient in subduing the captive dragons, i don't know how much you can call that cheating
user1: But he wouldn't have known that without having Toothless. 
user1: so maybe just an advantage not cheating 
user1: How do you feel about how Stoick treats Hiccup?
user2: Stoick leaving Hiccup, but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how Hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration
user1: i mean throughout the whole movie. he was rather harsh to him in the beginning
user2: Stoick uses Hiccup when Hiccups accidently reveals that Toothless can locate the dragon's nest. Stoick disowns his son
user1: That to me is very harsh
user2: However, when Hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless, Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son
user1: Did you like the ending? how they make Hiccup and Toothless basically equal? (both missing something vital?)
user1: How do you feel about the rotten tomatoes 98% score?
user2: Yes, when Hiccup wakes up on Berk, his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis, so he and toothless are the same
user2: I thought a 98% was a good score on rotton tomatoes

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hello, do you like fantasy animation movies? Because How to train your dragon is pretty famous for its dramedy. Good for children and adults.

user1: great! I like the 3d movies these days. they look so real. what do you think?

user2: oh my favorite character was for sure toothless. Such a cute dragon

user1: yes
user2: who was your favorite character?
user1: The animation was done very well don't you think?
user1: Astrit I think is how they spell it. She is the one Hiccup likes
user2: oh yeah! she's awesome
user2: They animated it really well! I love the way they make it super realistic and detailed, but still maintain its cartoony feel
user2: its a really neat combo
user1: yeah I like her attitude and the fact that she dosent wait on a man to save her
user1: yes it is. 
user1: my girls loved it
user2: that's awesome! i like that they made a balance with not needing a man to save her like you said,  but still let hiccup and her have a healthy relationship with depth and nuance
user1: yes not many cartoons have such a srtong willed female character. I never was a girly girl so I like how the movies are trying to have more diverse characters
user2: agreed. Seeing all the focus on representation is really doing cool things for the film industry in general i think! it's great
user1: Me too. I also like how they also put humor in for adults to that isnt so crude for children
user2: i always like that. I love rewatching cartoons from my childhood and being blown away at all the things i didn't get
user1: Yes me too
user1: its amazing how much you dont realize then go back and see that you didnt realize it before
user2: haha yeah, i wonder how much that happens in my life in general lol
user1: oh i know 
user2: are your girls pretty little? i imagine it's pretty cool to watch something and see both sides of that, you getting the jokes and them just getting the wonder and fun side
user1: I have a 9 year old and a 3 year old. yes it is quite enjoyable but I have always like the cartoons more so than other movies lol
user2: yeah me too! I like a lot of movies, but i watch a TON of cartoons
user2: i prefer serial cartoons to feature length tho =SD
user1: Dragons have always caught my fascination so having my girls like them too is even better\
user2: Thats awesome! what little baddasses =D excuse my language
user1: yeah my girls are more into the series cartoons now but im still a feature length though
user1: yes they are and i love it so no offence taken
user2: awsome =D well it was good talking to you, i think our time is up, the finish button lit up! I hope you get to see more rad movies with your girls!!
user1: thanks and you too

conversation:
user1: Hello?
user2: Hello.
user1: Were you given a document to read?
user2: Have you had a chance to see this movie? And yes, I did read it
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: It's about an awkward Viking boy who is an outcast
user1: What is the name of the movie?
user2: and he captures the most elusive dragon.  It's called How to Train Your Dragon
user2: And then instead of killing the dragon, he befriends him
user1: Oh.  Is it animated?
user2: It's animated and one of my favorite films
user1: It does sound very interesting.
user2: His world view is different from everyone else's on the island
user1: What does he train the dragon to do?
user2: Jay Baruchel is the voice of Hiccup, the awkward Viking kid and he does an excellent job
user2: the Toothless, the Night Fury dragon is injured when he was shot down in the beginning of the film, and so Hiccup teaches him to use a saddle and a modified tail
user2: And together they teach the village to respect the dragons
user1: How do the other Vikings react to this?
user2: Not well at first, his own dad, the chief, pretty much disowns him
user1: So they stop killing the dragons?
user2: Yes, and then by the end, each person has a pet dragon
user1: That would be pretty cool.  I like dragons.
user2: And everyone lives in peace... Until How To Train Your Dragon 2..
user1: Always a catch.  ha ha
user2: the dragons imitate animals well..so if you have cats or dogs, you'll relate
user1: I do have a cat.  Not very trainable, though.  ha ha
user2: Me as well, so you'll really enjoy the facial expressions of the dragon
user2: And the behaviors...
user1: I will definitely rent it.
user2: It's on Netflix, Amazon Prime and HBO, I actually bought it and fall asleep to it at least 2 times a week!
user1: Oh good, I have both Netflix and Amazon Prime.
user2: I have it memorized so when I take my glasses off, I can still enjoy the show until I fall asleep.
user1: I will keep that in mind!  I have a terrible time falling asleep.
user2: The sequel is as good as the first one, which is rare
user1: Thank you
user1: I agree
user2: Thanks for the chat!  Have a great day!
user1: You too
user2: Thanks.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user2: The movie is how to train your dragon. I haven seen it, but I am sure my kids have.
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: Yeah I saw it years ago
user2: Cool, looks like it got a good rotten tomatoes score and I think they made a sequal.
user1: I was still a kid back then and I remember liking it a lot
user1: I haven't seen the sequel
user2: Has more big names than I thought too, with Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill and Kristin Wiig
user2: Did you happen to read the book too?
user1: No, I didn't realize there was a book
user1: I'm tempted to check it out now though
user2: Me too. I would like to read the book first.
user1: It's definitely a good coming of age movie. The boy has to become a man by killing a dragon, but he becomes friends with the dragon and doesnt want to kill it
user2: Cool, sounds like an interesting story.
user1: They were definitely trying to promote a message of not being blindly forced into a way of life/culture, just because the older men thought that way
user1: He ends up convincing the others to live in harmony with the dragons instead of killing them
user1: The battle scenes are really cool, the animation was great for that movie
user1: I didn't know that it was the same people who made Lilo & Stitch
user2: I'm waiting for my son to be old enough to get it. He likes dinosaurs now
user2: Might like dragons too
user1: The main dragon, Toothless, looks very friendly
user1: He acts almost like a dog
user1: I think I was probably 13-14 when I saw it
user2: Yea, I actually might watch it myself instead.
user2: I may have had it on for background noise at some point. I honestly dont recall
user1: I'm trying to figure out who Jonah Hill was in the movie
user1: IMDB says he was one of the kids in the dragon-training classes
user1: They all had to take classes about how to kill their first dragon
user2: He is quite funny too.
user1: Definitely, have you seen Wolf of Wall Street?
user2: Yea, lol
user1: For the scenes where he snorted cocaine, they were using vitamin D power, and he had snorted so much of it he had a Vitamin D overdose and had to go to the hospital
user1: Have the documents changed for you? The task says new documents will appear but mine have been the same this whole time
user2: Yea, they have become longer
user2: I have never heard of a Vitamin D overdose.
user2: thats funny

conversation:
user1: Did you hear about How To Train Your Dragon? It has Jay Baruchel.
user2: I love movies about dragons. How to train your dragon is an awesome time
user2: title
user1: I like that it was done in 3D - the dragons looked really good in the air
user2: It's 3D animated. 
user1: It was directed by the same duo as Lilo & Stitch.
user2: The opposite of tamed dragons in this case is evil. intersting
user1: I can definitely see why it got 98% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: It's a thrilling action-adventure
user1: It was produced by DreamWorks Animation.
user2: Yeah 98% is an awesome rating
user1: I like that it was a coming of age comedy.
user2: How to train your dragon. I'm still thinking about that. It's catchy. I want to watch it.
user1: I like the idea of a Night Fury dragon.
user2: It's comedy as well? 
user1: Yes it is a comedy fantasy.
user2: Remote viking village hmmmm!
user1: It was interesting that Hiccup had to train a rare dragon that he shot down.
user2: Hiccup is funny for a name
user1: Especially when his dad is named Stoin
user1: Stoic
user2: Yes, I know. So he shot the dragons and the had to train them
user1: I didn't like when Stoic used Toothless to find the other dragons.
user2: They even had a dragon fighting class. 
user1: I'm glad that the dragons came to live with the Vikings, though.
user2: Toothless is an interesting name for a dragon.
user1: I thought it was cute that he had retractable teeth.
user2: They all have funny names. I

conversation:
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user2: Hi. I thought it was pretty good for an animated film.
user2: What did you hink?
user2: think?
user1: I think it was one of the best ones yet.
user1: The creators were very innovative
user2: Yes Dreamworks does a really good job
user1: Yes i agree. Do you think it fit the genre "coming of age"?
user2: Yeah I think that's appropriate
user2: but I think fantasy might be better
user2: Did you recognize any of the actors?
user1: I have only heard of the actor Gerald Butler I did not recognize it at the moment.
user1: what about you?
user2: Him and America Ferrera were the only ones I knew
user2: Did you like the setting?
user1: How dd you fee about the scene listed? The one about the fight between Hiccup and Night Fury?
user1: Yes, i feel like the setting helped the plot, the 3D animations were some of the best
user2: I like that part. The dragon had a really interesting look as well.
user1: Who do you think is the protagonist?
user2: I'd say it's definitely Hiccup
user1: Do you feel like the reviews reflect the movie?
user1: How did scene #2 make you feel?
user2: I think the critical response was a little awkward, but the ratings were spot on. You?
user1: I tend to not look at ratings when chossing a movie to watch. But i feel like they were reflective of the content 
user2: I don't think the description for scene 2 really captures how good it was
user2: I hear ya
user1: Scene 3 always made me feel upset for some reason
user1: It was kind of bitter sweet
user2: Yeah I don't like that the dad was so cruel
user2: But I liked that they were able to have a peaceful ending
user2: Do you think there will be a second movie?
user1: I feel like the ending was more to please children, after all it is a film made for children
user1: Yeah, if I'm not mistaken I feel like there is already a sequel
user2: super

conversation:
user1: I liked the energy of the film.
user2: hi
user2: do you watch the movie 
user1: I think the animation category was perfect for this film.
user2: Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life.
user2:  His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Gerard Butler) is chief of the clan. T
user2: the sfforts are good
user2: and the director did a great job
user1: I think that's reflected in the movie's 98% Rotten Tomatoes score.
user2: In the film, Toothless is a Night Fury, the rarest of all dragons, and is large enough to serve as a flying mount for both Hiccup and Astrid.
user2: this movie 3 part coming on 2019
user2: have you watch movie?
user2: do you like?
user2: hello
user2: r u here>
user2: i am waiting

user1: Hi have you seen How to Train Your Dragon?
user2: No, I never have.  Did you see it recently?
user1: Yes I watched it last night with my kids.
user2: Did you like it?  Did your kids like it?
user1: Its a dreamworks animated film starring Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, and Gerard Butler.
user2: I like Jonah Hill.  Was it good?
user1: Yes I loved it, and the kids loved the dragons, and the all the Ariel Battles.
user2: What are Ariel Battles?
user1: Oops aerial battles are battles that take place in the air. In the case of this movie. Dragons have fights in the air.
user2: I see.  Do you think this movie would be interesting for a date with my wife?
user1: I think if your wife likes Animated comedies then she will really like this one. Toothless (the main dragon) is adorable and my wife really loves him.
user2: Is it in theaters or can you watch it at home?
user1: Its usually on Netflix but It came out in 2010 so its no longer in Theatres.
user2: Is there singing in the movie?  Or is it just talking?
user1: Its not a musical just a standard fantasy.
user2: And is it a comedy or a drama?
user1: It is a comedy with some dramatic elements. Alot of father son relationship building.
user2: Interesting. Do you watch a lot of other animated comedies?  Do you think it was better than Cars or Toy Story?
user1: I think it was definitely better than Cars and I think it was better than Toy Story 2 and 3, but not better than Toy Story
user2: Wow, sounds like a very good movie.  Is it long or short?
user1: Its the perfect length for a childrens movie at just over 90 minutes
user2: Which company produced the movie?  Dreamworks?
user1: Yea its probably Dreamworks best movie since the first Shrek Movie. Its all about VIkings on the Island of Berk in a world where dragons are real. The main character is Hiccup a young scrawy Viking son of the chief Viking Stoic the Vast. Hiccup ends up befriending a dragon and changing the way Vikings view dragons in their world.
user2: Wow, I liked shrek a lot.  What role did Jonah Hill play?  I like him a lot.
user1: He is one of the first people to help Hiccup train dragons. A cocky kind of comic relief character.
user2: So it sounds like you would highly recommend the movie?
user1: I would absolutely. It is one of my favorite fantasy movies.
user2: Is there anything you would say was bad about the movie?
user1: Just that is has a 98% on rotten Tomatoes and a CinemaScore of an A
user2: That sounds really good, not bad.  Right?
user1: Yea those are excellent scores.
user2: Well, that sounds amazing.  What was the name of the movie again?
user1: How to Train Your Dragon
user2: Well that's pretty cool.  So it's on Netflix right now?
user1: I just checked, and I guess its nots
user1: sorry
user2: Oh, I'll find some other way to watch it.  And what is the rating? PG?
user1: I think so but my 3 year old has watched it nightmare free.
user2: Well, thank you for the recommendation.  I'll definitely check it out!
user2: Bye!
user1: Bye

user2: Nice! Do you care about ratings when you choose to watch a movie or not?
user1: I mean, yeah, I do like to check out Metacritic and read some of the reviews there. I used to like going to the IMDb forum for movies, but they closed them a while back. I like talking about movies on Reddit and other sites too.
user2: Looks like you really love watching movies
user2: I used to go to the movies every week but now i have a child and going to movies is almost impossible lol
user1: Yeah, I used to be more of a movie buff, now I go to the theater like once or twice every six months. But I watch movies on Amazon Video and stuff. I feel you, who has the time?
user2: I watch movies on netflix and on demand on tv. Who is the director of this movie?
user1: It has two directors. Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois.
user2: Do critics say it's a good movie?
user1: Do you watch a lot of these types of movies with your kid?
user1: Yeah, critics gave it good to great reviews 
user2: No, my kid is too little. He is only 10 months. I watch all types of movies. I'd say watching movies is my hobby
user1: Nice, what's your favorite movie? 
user2: I don't think i have a favorite movie. I love so many movies. I love Stephen King's movies
user2: "It" is probably my favorite. The original one. Not the new one
user1: Cool, yeah there are a lot to choose from. I tend to like drama, comedy-drama, some thrillers. Action adventure
user1: The original was very good, scared the s**t out of me as a kid.
user1: Haven't seen the remake yet
user2: Yes lol. I remember sleeping with my lights on for a while. I don't even know why my parents let me watch it. lol Who is your favorite dragon in

user2: I did not realize that either
user1: I liked it, but I don't know if it's 98% good.

user1: That seems fair. I do really like some of the cast, like Geard Butler and Kristen Wiig
user2: yea I totally forgot they were in it I love them
user1: Do you watch a lot of animated movies?
user2: yes I'm a mom
user1: Ha, me too!

user1: How did you feel about the scene where Hiccup fashions the special fin to guide Toothless in flight?
user2: showing kids how to be creative
user2: how long does this chat have to be before we can finish?
user1: We have to respond to each other at least 5 times for each movie scene they give me to talk to you about.
user2: so how many are left
user1: One more scene but it hasn't given it to me yet
user1: ah, there is it! :) 
user1: What do you think of the scene with Hiccup nearly drowning to save Toothless from a sinking ship?
user2: it was definitely a heart warming scene
user2: the "scary" dragon saves him
user1: I'm just a big fan of dragons in general, especially showing them to be more than the "bad guy"
user2: right, showing them with emotion and bonds and all that
user1: And the teamwork is a good example for kids
user2: the ability to care and love

user1: It is a good animated fantasy movie
user2: ok, then it must be kind of great because the director is someone i know does good work
user2: Chris sanders to be precise
user2: I guess having such movie in 2010 would have made it probably one of the best of that time
user1: It was a bit different from the usual fairy tale movies
user2: It is kind of crazy dragons would steal livestock

user1: I have. I liked the aerial battles.
user1: Who was your favorite character?
user2: probably the main character
user2: Hiccup is his name I think
user2: what about you?
user1: I liked Astrid, America Ferrera did a good job with her voice.
user2: Yeah. It's a pretty fun movie
user1: Do you like 3D movies?
user2: It depends
user2: this one would be fun
user2: you?
user1: I like them sometimes. This one is about Vikings so that's cool.
user2: yeah
user1: It has really good critic reviews
user2: and the dragons are so funny
user1: I wonder why the metacritic score is so low compared to Rotten Tomatoes?
user2: Yeah
user2: yeah I'm not sure
user1: This movie has weird names for characters
user2: haha
user1: Toothless and Hiccup
user2: that's part of why it's cute
user2: I love the name toothless
user1: They're trying to find something called the Night Fury which sounds a lot more serious than the names
user1: And then the Red Death
user1: Oh okay I guess they ride the dragons
user2: what's that about the red death?
user2: I'm confused ahah
user1: This seems like two movies in one
user1: So is hiccup a dragon? I'm confused too
user2: I think he is the kid
user2: the viking's son
user1: Yes it looks so
user1: And he finds toothless, which is a dragon
user1: And presumably rides him after training him?
user2: yeah
user1: And the bad guy's name?
user2: that's what I'm not sure of
user2: it kind of seems like the vikings are sort of bad
user2: like Hiccup was supposed to kill a dragon as part of a viking test
user1: Yeah they want to kill the poor dragon
user1: Stoick is the bad guy's nam
user2: gotcha

conversation:
user2: Hello, did you watch How to Train your Dragon?
user1: Hello. Have you watched the movie, How to Train your Dragon?
user1: Yes, I watched it a while back with my son. 
user1: Have you watched it?
user2: Yes, it is a great animation!
user1: I thought so too! I enjoyed the voice overs too. Gerard Butler is always great. 
user2: Yes, just like Baruchel
user2: Critcs rate it really well, like on rotten tomatoes an average of 7.9/10 is given
user2: Do you watch movies based on their rankings?
user1: I see that! It's interesting that there's some conflicting views on the coming of age story line
user2: Do you like watching movies that are fantasies?
user1: I wouldn't have chosen this movie myself, I watched it mostly becaseu my son wanted to watch it. But once he got it, I really enjoyed it. 
user1: Who was your favorite character in the movie?
user2: It has to be the dragon Hiccup, he is so funny at times
user2: Who was your favourite?
user1: I think the boy's name is Hiccup. :) I liked him, I can't remember the dragon's name :)
user1: Toothless? Is that the dragon?
user2: Silly me, I thought the dragon was called Hiccup!
user2: Possibly that was the Dragons name
user1: l love how much better animation has gotten. It's really enjoyable to watch, not like the clunky stuff when I was a kid. 
user2: What I like most about these movies is the animation behind it, how the 3D captures your attention
user1: Me too. And it's amazing that they can create facial expressions on animals or fantasy beings, which make you identity with them.
user2: We thought the same thing at the same time :D Pixar has been doing a really good job at making these movies really watchable
user2: Can you believe that this movie came out in 2010?
user1: No, I keep thinking it's not possible that much time has passed. 
user1: Hiccup Horrendous Haddock was the boy's name. :D No wonder he was awkward, with a name like that! :) 
user2: :D Now that's a mouthful!
user1: I'm glad that all is reconciled in the end of the movie, Hiccup and his father are happy, and the dragons and Vikings all live in harmony!
user2: Mee too! I've heard that critics say too much focus has been given to the fights and too little to the character development during the story
user1: I read that too, and I agree somewhat. I like when movies have a plot and you get to know the characters and become invested in them
user2: I agree completely, but in the end its a movie that is high in energy at least
user1: True, and it's something that a pretty good age range could watch. Younger kids would just be caught up in the action and pretty animation, and bigger kids would get more of the story line, whatever there is of it. ;) 

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hey
user2: Have you seen How to train your dragon?
user1: Yes it is a good movie.
user2: I agree, I liked it.
user2: I had not realized it was a bookseries first by Cressida Cowell.
user1: Wow me either.
user2: The director duo is also the same who did Lilo and stitch.
user2: I bet the book was really good.
user1: definately
user1: i like the 3D in the movie too
user2: The movie was so emotional deserves the 98% rotten tomatoes score for sure.
user2: I am not sure I RECALL THE 3D BUT i know I loved the movie.
user1: Yeah and a 74/100 Metacritic is pretty good for that site
user2: Dreamworks usually has some pretty impressive effects.
user2: Ya metacritc is a tough one.
user2: Reading some of the critiques I agree it is a coming of age dramedy.
user1: No wonder it was good. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures.
user2: Ya paramount picks a lot of winners.
user2: I would like to go visit the isle of black , if only it were real with dragons..
user1: The critics also talk about the great deal of time spent on aerial battles.
user1: Me too 
user2: Even if that is so, I think they did a good job with the emotional side of things.
user1: Yes great emotional highs and a few lows too
user2: For sure surprising depth..
user1: I like that Hiccups dragon was called Toothless lol

conversation:
user2: what do you think about the movie
user1: I think it sounds like a great movie.  Dragons have always been an interest of mine and it's presented in 3-D which I think it cool technology
user2: It looks like it had great special effects
user1: Judging by the ratings it would appear that many other people enjoyed it too although there may have been room for improvement.  A 74/100 to me would be a C in general education grades
user1: I also enjoy witty movies, it goes with the sense of humor I exhibit normally 
user2: it seems to be an insightful story to the movie with a lot of animation
user2: It is a comedy movie which I usually like
user1: Do you tend to favor a certain production company? Such as dreamworks/Pixar?
user2: Yes I think dreamworks and Pixar make quality movies
user1: I usually favor PIXAR because I think they tend to make movies that are more riveting and attention capturing but this sounds like a good DreamWorks contribution
user2: Didnt America Ferrera used to be in a tv series. shes a voice on the movie
user1: This movie has funny character names: Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III and Toothless
user2: This adds to the comedy element of the movie
user1: yes America Ferrera stars in superstore and ugly betty.  I enjoy the show superstore and think she's pretty funny.  She also has a unique voice that I could see lending to an animated character
user2: I remeber Ugly betty but I did not know she was in superstore
user1: An interesting thing to note is in the key scene it mentions shooting down a night fury, which is a rare and dangerous dragon; however, Hiccup's companion toothless is a night fury...doesn't sound like toothless is dangerous though with a name like that.
user1: Oh based off key scene 2 it seems like toothless was the dragon shot down?
user2: Hiccup is a funny name so is toothless so this adds to the comedy element of the film
user2: He ends up setting the dragon free which i imagine leads to a happy ending
user1: I like that Stoick is voiced by Gerard Butler.  He's such a versatile actor
user2: I never heard of him before what are some of his other films
user2: He voices Hiccups father
user1: He's played in 300, gamer, a few romantic comedies as well.  He usually plays in action movies and movies meant for adults so I find it somewhat interesting he would be in this animated movie for what I would assume would be children
user2: Maybe he wanted to try something different
user1: Based on the synopsis does this seem like a movie you would be interested in seeing?
user1: Looks like you were right, they all live in harmony at the end
user2: No i dont really like antimated movies that much but I think it would be good for children
user1: Do you generally watch movies based on ratings? Do you care about ratings for movies?
user2: No i just pick movies that i think will be interesting
user1: I do as well, I still get netflix movies

user1: "How to Train Your Dragon" was awesome! The visual quality was excellent, and the cast was phenomenal. I loved the action sequences and the overall message of the film.
user2: I have not seen it.
user2: Is it a cartoon? or actual actors?
user1: The movie is a Dreamworks animated film. Great visuals.
user2: I like dreamworks.
user1: Dreamworks has come a long way over the recent years. This movie is one of their best productions.
user2: You seem to highly recommend it!
user1: I do! Dragons are always fun. This movie also touches on many adolescent issues, like body image, rebelling against authority figures, general self-esteem issues...I think it sends a good message to young kids.
user2: you there??
user2: Ah sorry got impatient. that is cool.
user2: I also enjoy a good message.
user1: np, slow typer!
user2: Do you know it's ratings?
user1: It's got 98% on rotten tomatoes, Metacritic gives it 74/100. Overall very well-received.
user2: Oh wow! That is really high.
user2: Anyone famous doing the voices?
user1: So many! Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Gerard Butler. Jay Baruchel is the voice of the main character, "Hiccup".
user2: I like Jonah Hill.He is so funny.
user1: I love him in this. Are you a fan of fantasy?
user2: Craig ferguson as well.
user2: YOu mean fantasy movies?
user1: Lol, yes, movies, books, etc...
user2: Or is there some movie called fantasy .. Ah yes I do.
user2: I like all genres really.
user1: I think this has a different perspective, which is nice.
user2: I enjoy getting lost in a good story.
user1: Same. I also love challenging conventional views. This movie offers all of the above!
user2: It sounds like how to train your dragon is worth watching.
user2: Do you know the running time?
user1: I absolutely recommend it. It's based on a book, but I've never read it.
user2: I would not have thought it was based on a book.
user2: Interesting, maybe I will find the book prior to reading it.
user1: I don't know the actual running time. I was engaged throughout the entire movie. The last few scenes were intense!
user1: I just found out that it was a book. I'd also like to read it to compare.
user2: HMM, intense, but safe for kids to watch it right?
user2: I find books generally better, but I love movies.
user1: I had no qualms letting even my youngest watch it. It's rated PG.
user2: Oh ok, cool.
user2: Well you have made a strong case for watching it asap.
user2: Thanks for the suggestion... nice chatting, bye.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: The movie received a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes
user1:  Have you seen this movie? 
user2: What about you?
user1: No, but I think Craig Ferguson is funny. I would like to see the exhilarating 3-D animation.
user2: Craig Ferguson stars as Gobber the Belch.
user1:  This movie does have a 98% score on rotten tomatoes. It has a slightly less impressive score on Metacritic. I think it would still be very good. Do usually watch movies with this type of critical score? 
user1:  Are you still there? 
user2: I would try to find movies with great ratings and sounds interesting.
user1:  I have not seen many animated movies lately. Do you watch movies in this genre often? 
user2: In scene 1 the setting takes place in The Isle of Berk village.
user2: Hiccup is the name of the young kid. I think that is a strange name for a character. 
user1: Yes. That is a strange name. I like that he uses the mechanical devices to overcome his small stature
user2: But he actually thought he shot down one of those beasts.
user1:  I also think he seems very kind as he does not kill the dragon. 
user2: Hiccup actually saves the injured flying beast in scene 2.
user2: What do you think of that?
user1: I think that’s very sweet of him. I am glad to see that he underestimated himself and that he is able to claim and ride the Dragon.
user2: I thought he was fighting against them? Why would Hiccup saved one?
user2: Plot of the story?
user1: I think he sees that the dragons are not complete beasts. What do you think?
user2: After all he's been fighting them at age 15.
user1: Maybe he is just using that as a strategy.
user1: True.
user2: I think he was desensitized and tricked by these evil creatures. I think he's falling into their trap.
user1:  I don’t think all of them are evil. One of them tried to protect him 
user2: Scene 3 Hiccups show the creature to his father.
user1: I am sad that Hiccup lost his leg, but I think that it is very nice that they are now able to live in harmony.
user1:  I am also happy that he was able to save the dragon.
user2: That creature knows the direction to the nest. I like how Hiccup is using that creature to trick and show them the way to destroy them all.
user1:  I think the dragons are nice. Most of them anyway. 
user2: I don't really like this movie.

conversation:
user2: How to train your dragon was a great movie. What did you think about it? 
user1: Yes, it is a good entertaining movie.
user2: I thought they did a good job producing the movie based on the British Book "How to train your dragon. Do you think read any of the book and how did you think they did portraying it within the movie? 
user1: Unfortunately, I didn't read the book. However, it is great deal watching the trained dragons fighting the evil ones. That too with the 3D animation effects with the expression of friendship between the characters.
user2: I agree, the movie devotes a great deal of time to the battles of the dragons. There is the evil dragons and the tamed dragons, which dragon was your favorite? 
user1: Obviously the good dragon! The script is witty, intelligent.
user1: What do you think about its commercial success?
user2: I am not sure about that, but I do think that the ratings the critics gave the movie were pretty spot on. Do you agree with the ratings? 
user1: The ratings are pretty decent, it was not a failure movie though! What is your opinion about the 3-D animation?
user2: I thought they did a really good job with the 3-d animation. It was a great mix between the conventional ways and bringing the screen to life. 
user2: I loved the part when Hiccup finds that he did not shoot down night fury and feels bad and sets him free. what was your favorite part 
user1: I loved all the scenes, I have enjoyed watching it every frame! What do you think on killing the dragons as depicted in the storyline?
user2: I think that it just shows that peoples judgments get in the way of the realness of a situation. But it goes to show that  people can change their perception it they are just shown the way. That is one reason i love this movie 
user1: Do you like such Juvenile movies more?
user2: They are ok, my kids watch them all the time. So I have seen it a few times because of this. 
user2: What about you do you usually watch them 
user1: I like cartoons and such Juvenile movies more than the other Genre.
user1:  Do you generally watch movies with good ratings, apart from sitting along with kids for such Juvenile?
user2: I have a tendancy to look at the ratings and reviews before I watch them. But I don't just pick them based on the ratings. How about you? 
user1: I too follow the same as you mentioned. It is a good idea to watch for the ratings and reviews rather than feeling bad watching it.
user2: I agree, Metacritic usually has acurate ratings. Did this movie make you want to watch it again 
user1: Yes true, I have watched it around 5 times. Do you agree with its ratings?
user2: Yes I do, a 74/100 was very fair. 
user2: what did ou think of the ending of the movie 
user1: The ending was ecstatic, however, losing his leg part was not convincing!
user1: I felt Stoick, the dad, was so arrogant, however, later the storyline explained the reason for his stubbornness. 
user1: What did you feel when the dad and son fighting for the dragons! Which side were you?
user2: I was on the dragons side 
user2: the end was great i absolutley loved it 
user2: I want to go watch it again now. 
user1: Do you agree with naming the Night Fury as Toothless?

conversation:
user2: I didn't realise this film had the same directors as Lilo and Stitch, the animation is very advanced
user1: I didn't know that either. I also didn't know that it was loosely based off a book. The animation is very advanced for a film in 2010.

conversation:
user2: Have you seen how to train your dragon
user1: Yeah but it's been a long time, you?

user1: Me neither. 
user2: Yea he's great
user2: remember Hiccup?
user1: Yeah, slightly. 
user1: I vaguely remember tries to fight the dragon.

user2: yea
user2: I love Toothless
user1: I should go watch it again. I bet my son would enjoy it.
user2: Same here
user1: Chris Sanders did a great job directing it.
user2: I like the tv show they came out with
user1: I haven't seen it. Were the graphics as good as the movie? 
user2: Well I guess it depends on your tv but yes, pretty good graphics.
user2: I think it's on Netflix.
user1: I always appreciate a good ending, like how the Vikings and dragons learned to live in harmony. 
user2: Yeah, that's a good way to end
user1: Isn't the a sequel?
user2: I think so 
user2: I'm not sure though
user2: I liked how the relationship with Hiccup and his dad ended up
user1: I haven't seen it.

user2: My friend has seen it and she told me that she loved it.
user1: its a thrilling action animation movie. The 3d is really great
user1: you must watch it1
user2: I will try when I have time for it.
user2: What is it really about?

user1: indeed, fantasy animations like this always are
user2: I know I also like animated films because they mostly always have a nice and happy ending that will leave you satisfied after watching it.
user2: thats why there are my type of favorite.
user1: Yeah I really enjoy a good coming of age story as well. This movie is littered with that
user2: I know especially movies that are for all ages which makes them very fun to watch.
user2: I am going to think about giving this one a try because it sounds inspirational and it will give out great and happy vibes as well.
user1: Im glad to hear it. You will enjoy the cast as well! Gerard Butler is in it
user2: I know hes a great actor I like most of his movies to and the other cast that I see for this movie are great well and I am familiar with their movies to.
user1: I enjoy movies with fimilar cast members like this one
user2: I know its because we know the cast and have already seen them in other films which makes the movie more fun to watch as well.
user1: Sometimes its funny to compare the characters they play as well!
user2: I know its great!

conversation:
user2: The movie is How To Train Your Dragon. I think it's an excellent moving to watch due to the emotional possibilities
user1: What is the movie about?  I am looking to watch a movie with my kids this weekend, but want to make sure it is a kid friendly movie.
user2: It is an animated film that is great for both kids and adults alike. It is fantasy film that involves a friendship between a man and a dragon.
user1: Sounds like a movie that my children and I would love to see.  Is it a fairly new movie or been out for awhile?  I am assuming the man trains the dragon, but what is he training it to do?
user2: It was made in 2010, so it has been out for a bit, but it isn't outdated. I'm not sure exactly how he trains the dragon, but it is based off of a book.
user1: I see, I wonder if I should read the book first?  I try not to do that because the book will typically ruin the movie for me.  The movies can never quite capture the details or feelings I get from a book.  Well I will definitely have to give the movie a try and see what it is all about.  
user2: I think you will love the onscreen adaption of it. It's got witty animation and intelligent dialogue. The animation paired with the content will be perfect for you and your children. 
user1: That sounds great!  Well I think I have made my decision and I thank you for your time and insight.  Have a great day!
user2: You're welcome. I am glad I could help you! 
user1: Now if I could only get this to move forward so I can finish my task and go watch this movie.
user1: Who makes the movie?
user2: There is more information on this movie. The dragons sometimes steal the livestock, so there are warriors that fight the dragons. Instead, the main character Hiccup is not able to kill a dragon who is hurt, so he sets it free.
user2: It is a Dreamworks Animation film and the directors are Chris Sanders and Dean DeBiois.
user1: I love Dreamworks movies usually, definitely have to see it now.  
user2: It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 98% and a CinemaScore of an A. It definitely has great ratings.
user2: Would you like to know some of the voice actors?
user1: Rotten Tomatoes is pretty spot on with their ratings usually!  
user1: Yes, please indulge me with some of the voice actors
user2: Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, and Jay Baruchel are some of the amazing voice actors in this movie.
user1: Blockbuster cast in this movie!  I can't believe I have never heard of this movie, especially since I have children. 
user2: There is another key scene that you might enjoy. The dragon that Hiccup could not kill, Night Fury, stays in the forest where it is injured and cannot fly. Hiccup creates a prosthetic so the dragon can fly. He learns how to subdue captive dragons in training due to this event.
user2: I can't either! It's a classic and a movie you and your kids will never forget.
user1: That makes sense, I was trying to picture in my mind how a human could capture a huge dragon bare handed!  Was there multiple movies made or just the one?
user2: I am not sure. I think that information might be online. Would you like information about an additional key scene?
user1: Yes please, just no spoilers!
user2: No problem! The third scene sets up Hiccup's empathy for the dragons and his desire to free them. I don't want to give too much away.
user1: He looks at the dragons as gentle loving creatures, versus beasts that cause chaos.  That will definitely capture the audience's attention.
user2: I believe that is why the film is so incredibly popular. Critics really enjoyed it, mainly the cinematography and how great it looked, but also the tale in general and how funny it is. One critic claims they easily exceeded "the juvenilia Dreamworks released in the last nine years." 
user1: Great, well once again thank you for your insight I really appreciate it.  
user2: You're welcome. Have a wonderful day and I really hope you get to enjoy this film!

user1: It's a pretty good movie. It stars Jay Baruchel as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III
user2: I don't know who Jay Baruchel is. What other movie did he play in?
user1: He was also in She's Out of My League and The Sorcerors Apprentice.
user2: Ok, I think I might know who he is. 
user2: What is the rating for the movie "How to Train your Dragon" , on Rotten Tomatoes"\?
user1: The movie received a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 7.9/10
user2: Wow, that's a really high score to get.
user1: It's CinemaScore is also an A
user2: Do you watch animation movies a lot?
user1: If I hear they're good I will.
user1: Especially the ones made by Dreamworks like this movie.
user2: Yeah, Dreamworks makes good movies. 
user2: I don't like Disneys movies that much, especially lately they make some bad ones. 
user1: This film was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the duo who directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch.
user2: I did not know that the film is based on a British book! 
user1: Yes. It was loosely based on the book by the same name by Cressida Cowell
user2: I just realized Gerald Butler plays as Stoick the Vast.
user1: He plays a really good Viking Chieftan
user1: He's also Hiccups father
user2: Hiccups is the main dragon in the film, right?
user1: No. Hiccup is the son of Stoick the Vast.
user1: Hiccups Dragon's name is Toothless. 
user2: Oh, ok. Thanks
user1: Your welcome

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi
user2: Have you seen How to Train a Dragon before?
user1: Shall we discuss about the movie hope u had the document
user2: I do have the document
user1: yes i have seen
user1: the story was good and toothless and hiccup just rocks the show
user1: have you seen the movie ? did you liked it?
user2: Yes! I agree! I love the story line and such great movie for kids too!
user2: The animation on it is great!
user1: the animation is pretty good too for that time
user2: lol
user1: the part where night fury and hiccup in the forests were too good
user2: and the fight scenes were great
user1: yes the viking era was shown better 
user2: It's also a great Coming-of-age story
user1: the friendship between hicupp and night fury was developed carefully with fun and creative ideas
user1: and the dragon fighting classes were hilarious
user2: Yes agreed, the Directors did such a great job
user2: Hiccup did such a great job training  Toothless
user1: Yes where he tickles the dragon to win it over .. man the script writers were too funny
user2: So many different dragons too!
user1: and how he trains with prosthetic fin with toothless were well captured
user2: and so smart of Hiccup too!
user1: and when all the kids join with him and use the dragons to fight the big one in the climax  .. and how he lose his leg just like toothless are all added to include emotional drama
user2: It was such sad scene between Hiccup and his father when Hiccup was trying to convince his dad that toothless was not a danger and the dad angers the dragons into attaking instead
user2: such chaos
user1: yes
user2: I would recommend this movie to every one!
user1: yes everyone should watch and enjoy
user1: especially kids
user2: I agree!
user2: it was great chatting with you about such a great movie

conversation:
user2: Hi! It seems like the critic reviews were pretty mixed here.
user1: Did you notice that it had a high score on Rotten tomatoes?
user2: Yes, very surprising! Plus a CinemaScore of A which is cool.
user1: Definitely.  I wonder if the CinemaScore has to do with the really great 3D animation.  The 3D animation used was great.
user2: I agree! Plus the really strong cast, Gerard Butler and Jay Baruchel really made the movie amazing.
user1: I love both of them.  I find it hard to agree with one of the reviews that didn't think it was funny.  
user2: Definitely. Plus the one that says there wasn't much to character or story development, I definitely think there was a strong storyline.
user1: Agreed!!!  I know that book adaptions are hard because die hard fans of the book are looking for specific things that remind them of what they read. 
user2: It's hard not to hold a grudge against a movie based on a book, that's for sure. I didn't realise this was directed by the same guys who directed Lilo and Stitch, they really know their stuff!
user1: I didn't realize that either.  Plus I assumed that it was made by Pixar but instead it was released by DreamWorks.  They aren't known for the innovative animation that Pixar is.
user2: I didn't realise that Hiccup is only 15! I thought he was older than that for some reason.
user1: I didn't realize that either.  It makes him saving the dragon that much more endearing
user2: Definitely. Such a kind heart for a young boy. I love the part when he sets the dragon free, it really touches my heart.
user1: OMG I know.  It totally made me cry.  Plus Hiccup is amazing for all his inventions.  I love that he keeps trying even though they backfire.  He doesn't give up.
user2: His inventions are really cool, it's interesting to see such innovation in a kid's movie, it's a good example to set for younger kids.
user1: He's definitely a great example and totally relateable to the the awkward middle school kids who aren't doing what they would like to do
user2: I love that he named the dragon Toothless, it's such a cute name for a fearsome dragon.
user1: It was really clever.  You would assume by his name that his issue was with his teeth and not his crippled fin
user2: Right? And his face when he retracts his teeth is so cute, he looks like a cat.
user1: Kind of reminded me of the chershire cat from Alice in wonderland.  I was surprised that the blacksmith was the one teaching the dragon fighting class
user2: Gobber was easily one of my favourite characters, he provided so much comedy.
user1: Craig Ferguson was the perfect person to play that part.  So hilarious!!!
user2: He's such a phenomenal actor, I love all of his work. I love that once Hiccup bonds with Toothless, he won't harm another dragon, even for his father.
user1: He knew the risk of bonding with toothless and was willing to risk being disowned in order to act according to what he believes is right.  such an amazing message for kids  :)
user2: Right? Always stand up for what is right, even if you're opposed by your family or friends. The right thing to do isn't always the easiest.
user1: Definitely.  I'm sure it was devastating for Stoick to see his son almost die because of a situation he put him though
user2: Yes, I'm glad it all turned out okay. They all learned some pretty important lessons throughout the story.
user1: Definitely.  It's a great movie for parents to take their kids to where they will have fun and not realized that they are learning some really important lessons
user2: Plus it's a fun movie! Critics may not have received it well, but I don't know any kids who've seen this movie and didn't enjoy it.
user1: That's probably why it got an 98% on Rotten Tomatoes versus the critics
user2: Probably. When I watch movies I usually trust regular people's reviews and ratings more than the critics, I think they're jaded by being so involved in the movie industry.
user1: Me too!!! I think that critics aren't always looking for the same things as the intended audience for the movie

conversation:
user1: I think you're supposed to start first since you have the document.
user2: Indeed, sorry I just finished reading the document. Do you enjoy animated movies?
user1: Yes. Do you?
user2: Absolutely. The movie shown here is absolutely astounding. It has received an average Rotten Tomato score of 98%
user1: That is good. What is it about?
user2: It was a wonderful cast of voice actors including Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson
user1: Who is the main character?
user2: The main character is named Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Woah, that's a mouth full)
user1: What is the plot?
user2: It is loosely based on the British book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell. Devoting a great deal of time to aerial battles between tamed dragons and evil ones.
user1: That doesn't sound like my kind of movie. What genre?
user2: Animation and fantasy
user1: yeah, not interested. What genre do you like?
user2: I particularly enjoy these types of movies mostly because I am absolutely fascinated with 3D animation and the attention to detail given.
user1: Okay, AI robot dude. I prefer comedy
user2: Definitely not an AI. I have a bachelors in 3d animation and love these movies.
user1: I'm suspicious
user2: Cool. I'm just going to continue with trying to convince you to watch this movie because that's what I'm being paid to do.
user1: Okay, fine. Why should I watch it?
user2: There are lots of comedic moments especially since the main character is voiced by Jay Baruchel. I can't give any information outside of what is given, but look him up. 
user1: What country is the movie made in?
user1: Is it a foreign film?
user2: America, it's American
user1: I've never heard of Jay Baruchel
user1: I also don't particularly enjoy watching movies. 
user2: This is certainly the wrong HIT for you then. 
user1: But if I had to choose, I prefer comedy. I would rather watch a TV show.
user2: I would argue that television shows are just drawn out movies. 
user1: Yeah. I didn't know what to expect. Anyway, what's the name of the movie?
user2: How to Train Your Dragon
user1: Oh. I've heard of that. Have you seen it?
user2: I have and thoroughly enjoyed it.
user1: Okay, it's letting me finish the conversation now so I'm going to do that. I have to run to a meeting soon (I'm in grad school). Bye!
user2: Wonderful

conversation:
user2: hi there
user1: Hello!
user1: So we'll be talking about How to Train Your Dragon, right?
user2: Ive never seen that film
user2: can you tell me about it?
user1: Sure!
user2: whats it about?
user1: It's a story about A man named Hiccup who has to befriend a ornery dragon named Toothless to help save his village.
user2: Do you know what actos are the voices?
user1: Yep, Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson and America Ferrera
user2: oh I love them
user1: A very strong list of talent
user2: hows the illustration in this film?
user1: Very good, the cgi is very advanced and well-animated, everything is bright and flashy and high energy
user2: nice....how about the music?
user1: Very well done, nicely orchestrated and tense when it needs to be, it adds a lot to the film
user2: who was the dirctor?
user1: It was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois
user2: oh i think ive seen some of his films
user2: what do you think the age limits are for this film?
user2: can it be too violent?
user1: Yup, they've directed Lilo & Stitch
user1: I think it's appropriate for all ages really, some intense scenes but nothing graphic
user2: that sounds perfect
user2: do you know when it came out?
user1: Yup, it'd be a perfect family movie
user1: It came out in 2010
user2: ohhhh so I can probaly rent it
user2: or maybe stream it?
user1: Yup, it was very recent and it's much loved so it shouldn't be very hard to find at all
user1: Well, thanks for talking to me about this movie!
user2: same 

conversation:
user2: It sounds like people rated this  movie highly
user1: It's a thrilling action adventure saga with exhilarating 3-D animation
user1: more coming-of age dramedy 
user2: Yes, though it devotes too much time to arial Dragon battles 
user1: Yes, but it rouses you in conventional ways but its also the rare animated film that uses 3-D for its breathtaking spatial and emotional possibillities
user2: It doesn't have a lot of character development
user2: But is surprisingly sweet and poignant 
user1: Yes but you have to agree that How to train your dragon comes close to the level of Pixars out put while easily exceeding the juvenilia Dreamworks has released in the last nine years
user1: Nothing stronger then a good friendship between man and animal
user1: The duo who directed How to train your Dragon also directed Lilo & Stitch
user2: IAnd they cast some cool people, Jay Baruchel as Hiccup  for example
user1: Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson are big names too
user2: I hadn't heard of the directors though, is Chris Sanders a big name? 
user1: He takes a backseat to all the A-listers, Jonah Hill, TJ Miller, & Kristen Wig
user2: That makes  sense. Not everyone can be a big name. With how well the movie rated, it must've been a big thing for his career
user2: I like that they subverted the trope by having Hiccup not kill the dragon
user1: I like the scene when Hiccup finds the Night Fury dragon, and he gets over his fear of dragons
user1: Do you like movies about Dragons?
user1: I didn't like the part when Toothless was struggling to fly over the bolas, that was a tough scene to watch
user2: Yes, i like Dragons. They're super cool and can fly! I'd like to fly like hiccup and toothless
user2: Yeah that's sad, though when he gets the prosthesis it's awesome 
user1: The kid is pretty much a genius to figure that out at age 15
user1: Brains over Braun
user2: Yeah, that seems like a moral of the movie. Be smart
user2: I was sad when Hiccup got disowned
user1: Yep, plus he lost his leg
user1: rough stuff for a guy just trying to make peace
user2: Yeah, so now he matches toothless
user1: I didn't like when they defeated Red Death, it was too unbelievable
user1: that dragon was a beast
user2: It was huge! Though with a name like red death, you would expect that
user1: Times were tougher back then

conversation:
user1: Hi there - have you seen the movie How to Train Your Dragon before?
user2: No I haven't, what is about?
user1: It is an animation fantasy movie that is based on a British Book series with the same title. It is a coming of age tale about friendship between a boy and his animal.
user2: Is it live action or animated?
user1: It is animated.
user2: Anyone famous doing the voices?
user1: The voice actor are Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, TJ Miller, Kristen Wiig, and Chris Mintz-Plasse.
user1: actors*
user2: I really like Craig Ferguson, sounds interesting
user2: What rating is it?
user1: It has gotten great reviews, especially for its animation skills and comedy. If you are looking for a movie it may be worth a watch. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 98% rating
user2: It does sound promising, do you know what studio made it?
user1: Pixar studios made the film. Do you typically watch animated films?
user1: Actually I misread that. I'm not sure who made the film but it is compared to the level of Pixar in the reviews.
user2: Oh OK. I do like the Pixar stuff a lot
user1: Looks like DreamWorks produced How to Train Your Dragon - do you also like movies from that studio?
user2: I can't recall any DreamWorks movies by name, but yes I like some of their stuff
user2: What year was it made?
user1: It was made in 2010. Some of the key scenes from the movie involve interactions between a 15yo kid from a Viking Village and a dragon he finds in the forest after mistakenly thinking he shot it down. 
user2: I do like Dragons and I like fantasy movies as well
user1: This movie seems like it might be a good match for you!
user2: Yes it does sound like it could be fun to watch
user1: Do you enjoy action films as well? This movie has some animated battle scenes
user2: I really liked the Lord of the Rings movies, plenty of battles in those
user1: There's a scene in which the dragon, Toothless, ends up battling an entire Dragon's Nest - I think you might enjoy it
user2: Is the dragon named "Toothless"?
user1: Yes the dragon is named Toothless.
user2: I assume it does actually have teeth
user1: The name was given by the 15yo boy (named Hiccup) because the dragon can retract his teeth
user2: Cool... seems like the movie has some humor in it too then
user1: Yes some of the reviews mention the comedy portions as well. Think you will consider watching this movie
user1: ?
user2: Thanks for all the info, you've been very helpful

conversation:
user1: Hello! 
user2: Hi, how are you today? 
user1: Good, you? 
user2: I'm doing pretty good. Up to anything fun? 
user1: Not much, just working on mTurk. 
user1: The movie given to us today is How To Train Your Dragon. Have you seen it?
user2: Same here. Been a pretty quiet day on mTurk. I have not seen it, but I've heard a lot of good things about it. 
user1: It looks like it has great reviews. It has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. Do you ever read that site? 
user2: You know, I probably should, but since I'm a huge sci-fi fan, I tend to stay away. Their rating system isn't kind to my favorite genre. 
user1: I never used to pay too much attention, but I have to admit, I've found they are accurate a lot of the time, for me anyway. 
user1: It says this film has witty dialogue and a thrilling action-adventure story, so it sounds like it would be a fun movie to put on sometime. 
user2: It does sound interesting. Do you think it's more geared towards an older audience or maybe my 5 year old might enjoy it? 
user1: I think a 5 year old would probably enjoy it. It's just that some of the dialogue might be lost on them. 
user1: There's one particular scene where a character manages to capture a rare dragon but can't bring themselves to kill it. I think that's probably a good message for children. 
user2: I think at that age most dialogue is lost. So do you have any more details on it? Like who the central character is or the basic plot line? Who's training Dragons? 
user2: Oh, yeah, that's a pretty good message to get across. 
user1: The chief of the Viking tribe is too small to fight any dragons, so he comes up with mechanical devices to use, although they backfire sometimes. The main character is Hiccup, who is voiced by Jay Baruchel. 
user1: It's actually referred to as a coming of age dramedy, which is interesting for the film type. You might not expect that from an animated film. 
user2: So why are they fighting the dragons? Are the dragons bad? That is surprising that it's an animated film billed as a coming-of-age story. Most animated films tend to focus on much younger characters. 
user1: A lot of the story appears to be about this one character, Hiccup, and how he ends up taming one or more dragons. His dragon companion Toothless is named that way due to its retractable teeth. He studies their behavior and becomes successful in subduing dragons while training them. 
user2: That explains why my daughter's best friend keeps trying to name one of my chickens "Toothless." That's actually a great plot line message for kids. Sounds like it's promoting how to not harm others while making a connection with them. 
user1: Yeah I agree. And I think being gentle and kind with animals is always a good lesson. 
user1: I've never seen this movie, but I wonder if in the end they switch from dragon-fighting to dragon-taming or something like that. 
user2: That's a hugely popular topic in our house since we have a lot of livestock. I think I'll definitely be letting my kids watch it. 
user2: It would be cool if they did switch from fighting to taming. Do you think you'll watch it? 
user1: I might be quicker to watch it if it's available on a streaming site. It's just easier to bring up Netflix and play something that's on there. 
user2: I'm pretty sure I've seen it on Netflix, unless they took it off already. 
user2: Nevermind, it's not on Netflix and you have to rent it on Amazon. 
user2: It's only 3.99 on Amazon to rent, but if it's not really your thing, I wouldn't pay for it. 
user1: Hiccup subdues a dragon instead of killing it in his final training test, which ends up leading to his dragon Toothless being taken by his father, who disowns him. Hiccup and his friends have to set off to save the dragon and stop his father and the others, and his father ends up saving both him and Toothless. The dragons and the people end up living peacefully after that. 
user2: That sounds like a good ending. 
user1: Yeah, I bet it's probably cheaper at the video store anyway. I know Family Video has kids rentals for free. 
user2: Do video stores still exist? I live 2 hours from the closest city....so I don't exactly know if those are still around. 
user1: Wow! I'm jealous of you in some ways but not others. haha Yeah, I live in a small city of something like 30k people and we have 3 video stores. 
user1: There's also the Redbox boxes that you can go rent from. 
user1: It was nice talking to you today! 

conversation:
user2: So what movie are we discussing?
user1: Hi, Have you seen How to Train Your Dragon?
user1: Do you like animated movies?
user2: I have not seen it. I do like animated movies.

user1: It's directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois.
user2: wow they are the best
user2: Does it have any ratings?
user1: It's got 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. That seems really high, doesn't it?
user2: Yea it must not be good
user2: I only watch 99+
user1: You have really high standards, haha!
user1: It's totally worth a watch.
user1: What's your favorite Gerard Butler film?

user1: You should see RocknRolla. That's my favorite one I've seen him in.
user2: ┌─┐┴─┴ಠ_ರೃ
user2: indeed
user2: What's that about?
user1: I think it was Guy Richie that Directed it. It's about British Mobsters who heist an expensive painting.
user1: It's action packed and awesome cinematography.
user1: Kind of like How to Train Your Dragon!
user1: Except it's totally not for kids.
user2: hmm can my 90 year old grandmother watch it?
user2: We do everything together
user1: I'm sure she'd love it!
user2: Great ill go tell her now!
user1: She would also like How to Train Your Dragon!

user2: That's for all your amazing work
user2: ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
user1: There's this scene when Dragons are stealing livestock, and the towns people make these guns to shoot down the dragons.
user2: OMG WUT
user2: did they step on the grass?
user2: My grandmother doesn't like anything stepping on our grass
user1: It's all about training dragons, as the title says, haha
user1: They're dragons, they swoop down and grab the cows. The cows are the ones stepping on the grass!
user2: well then good for the dragons. They seem like the good guys
user1: That's another reason your gramma is gonna love this movie!
user1: What do you think about prosthetics?
user2: They look cool. but i like my limbs
user1: I don't want to spoil the ending, but how do you feel about dragons with prosthetics?
user1: Pretty cool, right?
user2: THE COOLEST
user2: ┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
user2: must've hurt like hell tho
user1: See, I knew you'd love this movie!
user1: It's all animated, so it's not even a real dragon

conversation:
user1: I did not know that How to Train Your Gradon was based on a book series!
user2: Hello!  Me neither - this film has many actors who I appreciate in other works.
user1: I'm surprised that it does not have much character or story development being based on a book... the story is written for them!
user2: True!  Many of the reviews highlight the films action and special effects.  I guess that was a bigger priority!
user1: I wonder how much the dialogue is based on the book - or if the actors had a lot of input.
user2: Good question!  Based on the length of the film and cast involved, that might be true!  Hard to plan around computer effects, though...
user1: Oh - it says that the book is funny, so it must have been based on it a bit.  I agree - the computer effects hinder the improv quite a bit.
user2: But I bet they look good!  I appreciate your use of details.  Did you check out the "strategies" tab below?
user1: These critical responses are a little strange.  I can't tell if they are pleased or upset about the movie.
user1: No!  I will now.
user2: The tab is interesting.  You're right!  The reviews seem to like the film, but almost feel bad about doing so - like they can't be satisfied!
user2: I am a big fan of the character names
user1: I'm glad that he did not kill the dragon - though they are not real, it would feel like an animal being hurt.
user2: Agreed!  People who hurt animals should be fed to dragons.  Poor little Night Fury!
user1: Yeah - I'm not a fan of any sort of violence, but hopefully there is a lesson learned by the end?
user2: The responses say "sweet" or "poignant", so I hope so!  The lesson is to train dragons, not...eat them?
user1: One of the reviews notes that it is "a coming-of-age tale with surprising depth and a sweetly poignant tale offriendship between man and animal."  So I'm going to guess that you are right!!
user2: The value of education is proven!
user1: Hahaha...! I wonder if anyone tries to take the dragon from him if he is rare?
user2: That's a good point!  Everybody wants a Night Fury - especially if they can be Toothless.  Gotta hide yer dragon!
user1: "What do you mean, dragon?  That's just a big horse!"
user1: ;)
user2: Ha!  Too funny.  Would you watch this film based on the description - or do you need pics of dragon fun?
user1: I would watch it!  It sounds interesting.
user1: I'm getting a bit lost in this story because of all the names!
user2: Wow!  This movie turned fast.  What's a "Red Death"?  Now Hiccup and Toothless both have physical injuries/disabilities.  Outcasts unite!
user1: Yes!  I was thinking the same thing - "That escalated quickly...."
user2: Vikings and dragons live life on the edge...
user1: Now I keep thinking about phantom pain and whatnot... will he walk with his new prothesis?  Was does viking prothesis look like?!
user2: ...but now they live there together!  Schweet.
user1: Yes!
user2: Probably sharp
user2: and imposing!
user1: I was thinking that it would be shabby... poorly put together.  He can't battle now.  Give him a tree limb and call it good.
user2: Maybe now he can be the wise oracle in a chair.  That's what I want for me.
user2: Thanks!  Pleasure to chat.
user1: Thanks!

user1: Hello
user1: Looks like we will be talking about How to Train Your Dragon. Have you seen it?
user1: This movie seems to have a good score
user2: Yes, since I have two kids, i Had no choice.:-) It is a thrilling action- adventure. But I did not get to see it in 3D. Have you?
user1: I have seen bits and pieces. My kids own this one and I think part 2? on dvd
user1: I should probably watch it thru
user1: Looks like it had some pretty good ratings- i was thinking it would do lower
user2: Yes the rottten tomatoes score is 98% and the CinemaScore is A. This movie definitely has good ratings.
user1: It's not as hot as like Frozen or some of the other ones
user1: I really am not familiar with any of the voice characters at all.
user2: It has some great cast though although we just get to hear their voices. 
user2: It has a really nice message in the movie and was surprisingly insightful.
user1: I'm reading some of the critic responses on that- it does seem like some good messages
user2: It has the voice of Gerard Butler 
user1: I should really watch this movie. My kids loved it. I think that maybe my husband took them to the theater to see it, but i did not go.
user1: I think I forgot it was a dreamworks movie too
user2: It is based on the British book by the same name
user1: I did not know it was from a book either
user2: Yes it was produced by Dreamworks Animation and distributed by Paramount
user1: i dont think i realized how much humor and comedy was also included according to these critics comments
user2: The book was written by Cressida Cowell and is a British book
user1: Seems interesting. 
user1: I wonder if it had any music in it
user2: Yes the story takes place in a remote Viking village
user2: I am not sure I see any information on the music.
user1: i feel like it probably must not have any popular songs 
user2: The story is interesting as it has dragons that steal livestock  
user1: Oh that does sound interesting.  
user2: Hiccup the fifteen year old son of the village chieftan tames the dragon
user1: Interesting that a child does that lol
user2: The main characters are Hiccup the 15 year old and he gives the dragon a name "Toothless" do you know why?
user1: I was reading this wondering if "hiccup" was the name of the boy in it.
user1: I have no idea why- does he not have teeth? LOL
user2: It has retractable teeth.
user1: like false teeth?
user2: Not sure, but Toothless seems to be crippled. That is a bit sad.
user1: Poor thing :(  
user1: I guess we are done now!  I will have to check out this movie.

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: hello?
user1: hi, just got here
user2: great
user2: so what do you want to talk about?
user1: well, sounds good if you're a child.
user2: I'm not a child.
user1: me neither. don't think i would go to see this.
user2: go to see what?
user1: the movie, "how to train your dragon"
user2: oh, what's it about?
user1: about people and dragons. sort of a comedy.
user2: who's in the movie? actors?
user1: it's animation. only voice actors.
user2: who are the voice actors?
user1: jay barchel, gerad butler, craig ferguson, america ferrara
user2: thats a great cast. how is the music soundtrack?
user1: can't really tell. nothing said about it.
user2: what's the runtime?
user1: doesn't say.
user2: would you recommend it?
user1: i'd recommend it if you like animation and children's stories.
user2: is it funny or boring?
user1: most of the critics describe it as funny or witty.
user2: do you know the IMDb rating?
user1: no, it doesn't say anything about that.
user2: what about a Rotten Tomatos score?
user1: 98% and average 7.9/10
user2: thats a good score. Do you agree with the critics?
user1: i haven't seen it so i couldn't say.
user2: are the dragons cool?

user2: Okay well thank you for the movie recommendation.
user1: you're welcome
user2: Have a good day.

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hi there
user1: Looks like we both have the documents this time
user2: do you have thoughts on the animatred movie ho to trsin your dragon from paramount pictures?
user1: It's a pretty good movie. I enjoyed watching it. The characters and animation were really solid.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: yes. critics have said it devotes time to arial battles between dragons, and I think it does part of the time, but the critisism undervalues the daring narrative and characters
user1: I liked the aerial battles. They were well thought out and I think the strongest point of the film are the characters.
user2: jay barachel as hiccup is a delight and a highlight for me.
user1: Hiccup is easily the best character in the film. His character arc is really interesting.
user2: I only just found out it was based on a book series
user1: Yeah though I'm much more familiar with the film. I was surprised to learn it was directed by the same people who made Lilo & Stitch
user2: I agree mostly with the critical response that its a thrilling action adventure film.
user1: Yes, though some were a little harsh on the coming of age message. I think it delivers it in a nice way without being too heavy handed
user2: Gerard butler and craig ferguson in the same cast? I must be dreaming!
user1: Yeah and they do a really good job as their respective characters. 
user2: I agree. I'll see anything produced by Dreamworks as this film or short animation is.
user1: Speaking of, honestly it's probably one of my favorite Dreamworks movies.
user2: as critics say, it is technically proficient 
user1: Yes, the animation feels real and fluid. It's a very pretty film.
user2: the 3d was utilized in dazzling and innovative ways
user1: I really liked Toothless. The dragon that Hiccup befriends.
user2: when hiccup makes  a harness to control the dragon to his whims, I thought it was very clever
user1: It was very interesting seeing Hiccup bond and watching them grow to understand each other.
user2: yeah well, the directors chris and sam or whatever really knew what they were doing
user1: Yes, they definitely did a good job. The final battle was very well put together and the finale against the giant dragon was amazing.
user2: When Gobbler teaches that dragon fighting class, I was like, 'whoa, this is shapes of Viginia Wolfe.'
user1: And while he loses his leg in the end, Hiccup doesn't let it slow him down.
user2: well he is cheered upby his unexpected success
user1: And I think we're done.
user1: Nice talking with you.
user2: cool

conversation:

user2: Hello
user2: Let's talk movies.
user1: Absolutely! What movie?

user2: It is loosely based on the book.
user1: Interesting! Is it considered a good movie?
user2: Yes, the Rotten Tomatoes score was 98%.
user1: Wow!! That is great! Often Rotten Tomatoes can give such poor scores. It sounds like a good movie! Is it animated or live-action?
user2: 3D computer animated
user1: Nice, and I'm sure with the technology these days it is really high quality. Have you seen it?
user2: It is exhilirating. I did see it in theater.
user2: It's a mix of adventure, comedy, and coming-of age
user1: Cool. Is it a movie directed at children?
user2: Yes, the main character is a young man.
user1: Where is it supposed to be set?
user2: Berk, a remote Viking Village
user1: Neat. What time period?
user2: It's not specific but during the time of vikings.
user1: That makes sense, of course. Is it just one dragon that is in the movie?
user2: No there are several dragons.
user1: Cool. Is there a love story piece to it?
user2: No.
user1: Is there a sequel to this movie?
user2: I don't know.
user1: What year was this movie made?
user2: 2010

user1: That sounds great. Perhaps I will watch it in the near future! Thanks for chatting with me!
user2: sure

conversation:
user1: Hi. I am planning on going to the movies. I hear that How to Train you dragon has a good rotten tomatoes score
user2: Yeah it looks super exciting based on our world view being wrong. 
user1: I bet Craig Ferguson is great as the voice of Gobber the Belch.
user2: I agree. The director Chris Sanders made great use of the voice talent.
user1: Yes, there are so many aerial battles between the tamed and evil dragons. 
user2: Not to mention the insightful script.
user1: Yes, the computer-animation is even in American 3D. 
user2: Yes the 3D is breathtaking with spatial and emotional possibilities. 
user1: It is loosely based on a British book series, named Cressida Cowell. 
user2: It seems like a waste of a funny book. 
user1: It is a thrilling action-adventure. Are you aware of any key scenes?

conversation:
user2: Hello how are you?
user1: Hi, great thanks!  How about you?  :)
user2: I’m great thanks! Are you a fan of animated movies?
user1: Yes, I love them!
user2: Awesome! Have you seen How to Train Your Dragon then?
user1: No, somehow I managed to miss this one.  Have you seen it?
user2: Definitely! You should really give it a try. Any reason for not seeing it yet?
user1: No reason, just one of the ones I haven't gotten around to.  What did you enjoy about it?
user1: I always love the DreamWorks movies, I'll have to make this a priority now.
user1: Plus I've always loved dragon movies and books
user2: The story is excellent and I love he character dynamics! I’m a huge fan of mystical creatures and this film really does a great job in creating the lore
user1: Yes, that's a big part of the appeal for me too
user1: Oh, I love that it's set in a Viking village!
user2: It’s also a great underdog story as well! The protagonist is just so likeable!
user1: Yes, the new paragraph has already captured my heart, I just love stories like this!\
user1: Do Stoick and Night Fury become friends after he sets him free?
user2: Great! Also this is one of the few films where the 3D works in its favor and the flying scenes are amazing!
user1: Oh wow, I love good dragon flying scenes!
user1: I love that Stoick is an inventor and that his inventions sometimes backfire  :)
user2: Yeah!And the main dragon toothless is such a unique dragon design. He comes across as a lizard and cat in which is quite unique for a dragon design. It might be my favorite dragon design
user1: Oh wow, I would really like that
user1: Oh, I see now, I had the characters confused... Hiccup is the inventor, right?
user2: Also it’s one of those few films where the sequel is better than the original and the original is already amazing and enough
user2: Yeah he’s the inventor 
user1: So Hiccup becomes the person who can subdue the captive dragons, making him a local hero I imagine
user1: Is Stoick proud of Hiccup's accomplishments?
user2: Yeah. It’s a great moment because in the strong Viking village he’s physically the weakest despite his father being the leader of the tribe
user1: Oh, I hate that Toothless loses a leg!
user1: It's great that Hiccup can build a prosthetic for him though
user1: And I love that it has a happy ending, with the dragons and Vikings living in harmony  :)
user1: Very nice underlying moral, that the smallest and weakest can be the hero
user1: Is there anything else that you particularly enjoyed about the movie?\
