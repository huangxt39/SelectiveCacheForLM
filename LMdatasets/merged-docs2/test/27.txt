Octavia Spencer as Zelda Delilah Fuller, Elisa's co-worker and friend who serves as her interpreter.
Michael Stuhlbarg as Dimitri Mosenkov, a Soviet spy working as a scientist studying the creature, under the alias "Dr. Robert Hoffstetler".

critical response:
one of del Toro's most stunningly successful works... also a powerful vision of a creative master feeling totally, joyously free.
Even as the film plunges into torment and tragedy, the core relationship between these two unlikely lovers holds us in thrall. Del Toro is a world-class film artist. There's no sense trying to analyze how he does it.
The Shape of Water has tenderness uncommon to del Toro films. ... While The Shape of Water isn't groundbreaking, it is elegant and mesmerizing.
refer Sally Hawkins' mute character as 'mentally handicapped' and for erroneously crediting actor Benicio del Toro as director.

description:
Elisa Esposito, who as an orphaned child, was found in a river with wounds on her neck, is mute, and communicates through sign language. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema, and works as a cleaning-woman at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore at the height of the Cold War. Her friends are her closeted next-door neighbor Giles, a struggling advertising illustrator who shares a strong bond with her, and her co-worker Zelda, a woman who also serves as her interpreter at work.  The facility receives a mysterious creature captured from a South American river by Colonel Richard Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a humanoid amphibian. She begins visiting him in secret, and the two form a close bond. 
Elisa keeps the creature in her bathtub, adding salt to the water to keep him alive. She plans to release the creature into a nearby canal when it will be opened to the ocean in several days' time. As part of his efforts to recover the creature, Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, but the failure of his advances toward Elisa hampers his judgment, and he dismisses them. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the creature devouring one of his cats, Pandora. Startled, the creature slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. The creature gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. The creature touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm; the next morning, Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. Elisa and the creature soon become romantically involved, having sex in her bathroom, which she at one point fills completely with water. 
Hoyt gives Strickland an ultimatum, asking him to recover the creature within 36 hours. Meanwhile, Mosenkov is told by his handlers that he will be extracted in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the creature's health starts deteriorating. Mosenkov leaves to rendezvous with his handlers, with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Mosenkov is shot by one of his handlers, but Strickland shoots the handlers dead and then tortures Mosenkov for information. Mosenkov implicates Elisa and Zelda before dying from his wounds. Strickland then threatens Zelda in her home, causing her terrified husband to reveal that Elisa had been keeping the creature. Strickland searches Elisa's apartment and finds a calendar note revealing when and where she plans to release him. At the canal, Elisa and Giles bid farewell to the creature, but Strickland arrives and attacks them all. Strickland knocks Giles down and shoots the creature and Elisa, who both appear to die. However, the creature heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the creature takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where, deep under water, he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, she starts to breathe through gills. In a closing voiceover narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived 'happily ever after' with the creature.

user1: Hello. So, this movie has a pretty good Rotten Tomatoes score!
user2: It does.  Its a great dramatic film.
user1: Guillermo del Toro generally directs good movies. Don't you think?
user2: This is the only movie I have seen of his, but it was definitely an unusual love story
user1: Sally Hawkins said so much without saying anything at all.
user2: She did an amazing job portraying a mute cleaner in this film, but the love story was so sad as well.
user1: Yes, a love that is basically forbidden. That makes for a drama if I ever did see one!
user2: No doubt!  I felt bad for the poor amphibian living in a government laboratory however.
user1: Yeah, that is something I felt horrible about as well. It reminded me of animals in a cage.
user2: At least this zoo animal had someone who loved it.
user2: Elisa's childhood was definitely sad don't you think?
user1: Yes, very much so. I can't even imagine having all of that abuse done to me.
user1: It seems like such a lonely life.
user2: And this was in the old days - where her in the closet neighbor had to hide his true identity
user1: Yeah. The stress that they must have endured is insane. I think all of the actors and actresses did a fantastic job of having the audience and viewers feel what was going on.
user2: Yes.  The movie was extremely well directed and Sally Hawkins did a great job in her role.
user1: Imagine being in that position and keeping the creature in the bathtub. 
user2: The part where she was going to release the creature is pretty crazy
user1: Yeah, that really kept me at the edge of my seat.
user2: It was interesting how the creature had mysterious healing powers
user1: Yeah, it is so cool because I felt as though that the movie had a balance of drama and fantasy.
user2: Right.  The romantic part in the bathtub was a bit different however.
user1: Uh, yeah. I was a bit weirded out by that. I kind of kept thinking that she was going to die!
user2: The ending was a bit crazy however.  You knew there would be a shootout but after that...
user1: Yes, I was almost in tears by the end. Did it affect you like that too?
user2: Yes it was sad but happy at the same time.  
user1: I agree. That's the type that gets to me the most. Lol. It tugs on all of your emotions at the same time,
user2: Yes it does.  This could almost qualify as a "chick flick" but it had a bit too much action.
user1: I agree. All of the rough parts kept bringing me back from my trip of sadness. Haha!
user2: Yes.  It was definitely an amazing movie overall.  Well worth seeing!
user1: Yes. I'll definitely be watching it again at some point. There was a lot to absorb.
user2: Yes it is definitely a movie you could watch multiple times..

conversation:
user1: HI!. I want you to check out The Shape of Water by Guillermo del Toro.
user2: Hello, that movie sounds interesting. Could you give a little review?
user1: It has Rotten Tomatoes 92% rating, and got an A from CinemaScore. It is an American fantasy drama, a love story
user2: Great, what is the plot?
user1: The plot is about a mute cleaner who works in a secret government lab, and falls in love with an amphibian being trapped in the lab.
user2: That sounds intriguing, and how that amphibian got the lab?
user1: The amphibian was captured in the Amazon River, and brought to the lab to study
user1: They are trying to study the amphibian so that they can get an edge over the Russians during the arms race.
user1: They stun and immobilize the creature, and then lock him in the lab for study
user2: Awesome, fantasy and thrilling argument of the rivalry between U.S. and the Soviets. 
user1: Yeah! And don't forget it won a bunch of awards, including best picture.
user2: The main characters are played by who?
user1: Sally Hawkins plays the mute cleaner,
user1: Also there is Michael Shannon as the antagonist, Richard Jenkins as Elisa's friend, and Octavia Spencer as her friend also.
user2: I am not really familiar with Sally Hawkins, however Michael Shannon  and Richard Jenkins are great actors!
user2: I should take some time to see this movie, definitely.
user1: Yeah I agree! Michael Shannon makes a great enemy, and Richard Jenkins is always a great character actor.
user1: Yes, I always try to check out the movies that win Best Picture. More often than not they are good.
user1: Do you know how we tell when we are done?
user2: Yeah, I have that habit too. And Guillermo del Toro totally deserved that award. His work is always pleasant to watch!
user1: Yeah, I liked Pan's Labyrinth too
user1: I try to follow what he is doing and watch most of his films
user1: Do you know what else we are supposed to do for this HIT? I'm not sure what the next step is
user2: Surely, Pan's Labyrinth is one of the movies for what he will be remembered. 
user1: Yes, he has a way of creating different worlds and interesting creatures.
user2: Do you something else about the Shape of Water? Some fun facts or something?
user1: Yeah, I found it kinda weird to have love scenes between the human and the amphibian! hehe
user1: But everything is done pretty artfully etc
user2: Well, it is kind of funny but it was already done in previous movies such as The Little Mermaid I think, but less visually of course.
user1: The main character uses sign language to talk to the creature.
user1: You have to realize, that the main character was orphaned and ALSO found in a river, with wounds on her neck.
user2: That makes perfect sense, since Hally is acting as a mute. That would imply that this creature is quite smart too.
user2: What were the shape of those neck marks?
user1: Yes, it is definitely implied. There is a lot of symbolism and allegory in the film.
user1: They are like slashes from a knife..., kinda mirroring the gills of the amphibian creature.
user2: That is highly curious, could you describe some film scenes? 
user1: Sure. Elisa (main character) keeps the creature in her bathtub, with salts. He cannot survive that long out of water.

conversation:
user1: The Shape of Water was pretty good, I'd rate it as one of Guillermo del Toro's best movies.
user2: Yes it is good
user1: Sally Hawkins is mute in it, which is impressive as an actor.
user2: She is very good
user1: Doug Jones is in it too, he does great creature work.
user2: Who does he play?
user1: I believe he plays the captured humanoid amphibian creature
user2: He was very good
user1: Yeah, the reviews were pretty much unanimously positive.
user2: Yes
user1: The story is pretty interesting too, has fantasy elements.
user2: Yes
user1: The main character is an orphan who was found in a river.
user2: Interesting
user1: She eventually learns to communicate with a creature she finds at her work.
user2: That's good
user1: She eventually keeps the creature in a bathtub.
user1: The RottenTomatoes score is 92%.
user2: That is very high
user1: Yeah, and the the users gave is 8.4/10
user2: Also very good
user1: The Metacritic score is 87/100
user2: That is very good
user1: and the CinemaScore is an A
user2: It has good reviews from everyone
user1: The movie is a bit violent though, as long as you don't mind that.
user2: That's ok
user1: There's some scenes with the use of guns.
user2: Also ok
user1: It shows people dying on screen too.
user2: That is sad
user1: There's also some nudity.

conversation:
user1: hello! 
user2: Hi!
user1: Did you see The Shape of Water?
user2: I  have heard about it
user2: I never seen it before. Please tell me about the film
user1: Well it's a really good movie, what kind of genres are you interested in?
user2: I like action, comedy, horror type of movies
user1: Well, it's a fantasy/Drama film. 
user2: I figured it was a drama film
user2: who is the main character?
user1: It's about a mute cleaner and she works at a secret government lab
user2: ok. sounds interesting. did she witness anything she did not suppose to at her workplace?
user1: Yes, a mysterious creature shows up one day and she is intrigued and decides to visit him and they form a close bond.
user2: So the figure became her best friend, huh?
user2: i mean creature, sorry
user2: What happens next?
user1: In some ways. She feels like they understand each other because she's mute and he doesn't judge her just like she doesn't judge him for being a strange fish creature. 
user2: Oh.. that's sound very interesting. Do they have to face any enemies in the film?
user1: Well this film takes place back when prejudice is still very common, and the main character is best friends with a black woman and a gay man, so it really delves into that 
user1: Yes, the main antagonist is the man who brought the creature to the lab, Richard Strickland. 
user2: So there is a bit of diversity in the film, that sounds cool. 
user2: So the guy was going to do a experiment on the creature and the mute lady will stop him? Or that isn't true?
user1: Yeah he wants to kill the creature to study it and she hatches a plan with her friends to help save him
user2: Wow I kinda figure that. 
user1: It's got really good scores on all the movie rating webpages

user2: I don't know much of her work but I am a big fan of Guillermo Del Toro
user2: and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as well !
user1: I'll have to check out his other films. I am impressed that a movie about a humanoid amphibian creature could be described as "elegant and mesmerizing".

user2: In the bathtub?
user2: I thought it was sweet that she was caring for him
user1: yes, I thought so also
user1: however the romantic scenes were definitely a bit odd to me

user1: It's listed as a fantasy drama.
user1: It's set in 1962 Baltimore and follows a mute custodian at a government labratory.

user1: The mute custodian falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature.
user2: Lol wow that's an interesting conversation.
user2: i meant interesting combination
user1: Yeah that's what I thought, but I also thought how would they have a conversation if the janitor is mute.
user1: She communicates via sign language.
user1: She was an orphaned child, who was found in a river with wounds on her neck.  
user2: Did it come out in 1962 or is that just the setting
user1: That's the setting, it actually came out last year.
user2: What actors are in the movie?
user1: The facility she works at receives a mysterious creature from a South American river.  The janitor finds this creature, and begins visiting him regularly and they form a close bond.
user1: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, and Richard Jenkins are the main actors, and I don't recognize any of them to be honest.
user2: Lol yes that is why i asked sometimes i do base my movie choices off who's in it.
user2: It does not pretty interesting is it on Netflix or cable TV?
user1: She eventually gets the creature to her home where she keeps it in the bathtub. I think it's just getting released on movie.

user2: I wonder if the creature is like "swamp thing"
user2: ?

user1: What are your thoughts about a main character using sign language?
user2: I think that it's good
user2: More diversity in the movie industry
user2: Do you usually go for this genre?
user2: Fantasy drama
user1: How do you feel about the creature being captured and placed in the facility? 
user1: How do you feel about her taking the creature?
user2: I think that it would be horrible if it's a sentient creature to keep it locked up
user2: I don't know. If it was a sentient creature, I don't think the government had any business keeping it locked up.
user1: How do you feel about the creature having healing powers ?
user2: Seems pretty fantastic
user1: What about her having relations with the creature ?
user2: I can't believe the creature would eat a cat
user2: Don't know.
user2: This movie has fantastic ratings.
user1: Do you think she went with the creature? 
user2: Don't you think?
user2: I don't want to know to many spoilers
user2: *too
user1: Would you have told on her?
user2: I don't know. Would probably depend on the circumstances. How about you?
user1: Would you help them out?
user2: If it seemed like it would be the right thing to do.
user2: Probably
user2: Don't really knoe
user2: *know
user2: How about you?
user2: Would you help them out?
user1: Why do you think the creature jumped in the water with her?
user2: Maybe it wanted to escape.
user2: I don't knoe
user2: *know
user2: Bye!

conversation:
user1: Okay, let's talk about The Shape of Water! Have you heard of it?
user2: No. Have you?
user1: Yeah, I've seen it. It's a fantasy movie about a woman who is mute and falls in love with a "humanoid amphibian creature.'
user2: Wow it sound intriguing.
user1: It takes place in a secret government facility and involves Soviet spies and the government's attempt to study this creature. The woman who is a mute is a cleaner at the facility.
user2: Does she free him, it?
user2: When did the movie come out?
user1: Hmmm, no information on that. It stars Sally Hawkins as the mute cleaner, and Octavia Spencer is in it as well. Critics say things like, it "isn't groundbreaking, [but] it is elegant and mesmerizing." 
user1: It came out in 2017
user1: not sure what date
user1: Do you want any ratings?
user1: One of the critics calls Sally Hawkins' character "mentally handicapped," which isn't exactly PC and obviously isn't accurate. 
user1: Bueller?
user2: Bueller?
user1: Sorry, just a joke. You disappeared on me,
user1: Okay, so, I thought we were going to talk about a second movie, but this info is about the same one...
user1: It's directed by Benicio del Toro
user1: Oh, and Michael Shannon is in it as well, I recognize that name. He plays a corrupt government agent.
user2: I like him
user1: I have some information about a couple of scenes, do you want to hear any of that>
user2: Sure
user1: Sally Hawkins' character is named Elisa Esposito. She lives in an apartment above a cinema, communicates in sign language, and she has strong bonds with her neighbor Giles (an artist) and Zelda, a woman she works with.
user1: (I guess that's more setting the stage)
user2: Oh pk
user1: Apparently, the facility she works at receive a creature that was captured in a South American river. She's curious about it, so she takes a look and discovers it's humanoid.
user1: This is good - she ends up keeping the creature in her bathtub and plans to release him into a nearby canal. This is all taking place in Baltimore. So, that answers your earlier question. 
user2: What year is the movie supposed to take place in?
user1: 1960s..in Baltimore
user1: Critics seem pretty high on the movie overall, at least based on what I have.
user2: Oh, now I want to see it!
user1: Things like, "One of del Toro's most stunningly successful works..."
user1: "...the core relationship between these two unlikely lovers holds us in thralll..."
user1: *thrall
user1: This relationship is definitely romantic.
user1: Are you still there?
user1: Do you generally like movies that have high ratings on the sites I mentioned?
user1: Hello?
user1: I'm pouring my heart out here.....

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: Hello!
user2: how are you
user1: How are you?
user2: i'm good
user1: Good, thanks for asking!
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: what's the movie?
user1:  The Shape of water
user2: no but i really want to :( have you?
user1: I really want to as well!
user2: it looks really promising most people say its pretty good too
user1: I heard so many god things about it and the movie trailer looked amazing!
user1: I'm fascinated by the idea of mermaid-like people:-) so anything like that peaks my interest!
user2: Oh yeah the trailer was amazing, I'm a sucker for any kind of movie personally long has the story is good
user1: But the story of a love possibility between a human and a mermaid-like creature-that's something! And this woman was mute!
user2: whenever I have a chance I'm making it a first priority to see it :)
user1: It also explores the theme of how humans always want to abuse, exploit and destroy something for their own benefits
user2: yeah i'll definitely be watching it lol
user2: seems interesting 
user1: so, if these creatures do exist, as some claim:-), I don;t blame them for hiding from us!
user2: oh yeah I'll like the surprise of seeing creatures that weren't presented in trailers haha
user1: Same here, I want to see this movie really bad-alone though, my husband thinks it is creepy and strange to see a mute woman and a mermaid creature getting close!lol
user2: haha that's understandable, i mean it's creepy but I think it's beautiful. and a different take on love and romance
user1: I feel the same way! It's the bond of love and trust that goes beyond the human reach, it's just a story, after all:-)
user1: I don't recognize any actors though, but it has good ratings and seems very promising
user2: yeah me either, but this could be their breakout moments. And if they're good, i'll be looking for more work of theirs
user1: definitely!
user2: Really hoping this movie is in 4K lol
user1: I'm not sure about that
user1: but it's new
user1: it came out in the fall of 2017
user1: Thanks for chatting with me today I hope you enjoy the movie! Have a good one!

user1: yes CinemaScore it an A
user1: yes and the love story was a good one too
user1: Sally Hawkins did an amazing job 
user2: Del Toro and Vanesa Taylor write the story
user2: yes she did amazing acting 
user2: she put a lot of drama tension in the movie
user1: did you like the co - workers who was interpreting fo rher
user2: Zelda ,yes

user2: bye

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello! How are you? Any movie recommendations?
user1: actually i did not get any documents
user1: they directed me to the chat
user1: directly
user2: Ok! Well have you seen the recent Oscar winning movie Shape of Water 
user1: do you have any movie recommendations?
user1: nope
user1: but i heard about that movie
user2: Cool! What info have you heard about the film so far 
user1: i heard that the movie was good and nice story
user1: did u watch the movie?
user2: That’s fine cause here my chance to sell you on how great the film is!
user1: what is ur opinion about the movie?
user2: I love the film. It takes all the tropes old school horrors and turns it into a romance 
user1: okies
user1: what was the story about?
user2: Now the question for me is if you are interested in that sort of genre. It’s about a mute lady that works as a janitor in a science facility who has an affinity for water and eventually falls in love with the creature from the black lagoon 
user1: ohh the story sounds good
user2: Perfect the film takes place in the 50s during a time of racial and gender tension so the romance parallels those tribulations 
user1: some people are saying when they watch this film it resembles the Beauty and the Beast  movie
user1: is  that true?
user2: Definitely! Except the only thing is that he stays in his monster form 
user1: ohh okies
user1: how would to u rate the movie out of 10?
user2: Are you willing to give it a shot?
user2: Id give it 9 out of the 10. The villain was sort of typical 
user1: okies
user2: Any other questions about the film?
user1: the movie has any drawbacks?
user2: Not really beside the villain. I don’t want to hype it up or anything. I’d rather you experience the film itself 
user1: soon i will watch the film
user1: thanks for the info
user2: Any time if you love horror and romance this would be a cool film to watch 
user1: generally i will love to watch the horror films
user2: Cause there are some freaky scenes with monster before he falls in love 

conversation:
user1: hi!
user1: the movie is The Shape of Water
user2: So what did you think of the movie?
user1: I liked that is a newer movie(2017) and that the genre is Fantasy,Drama.
user2: It is.  I really appreciate Del Toro and his depiction of the human condition.
user1: and the good rating helped me decide togo see the movie?
user1: have you seen it?
user2: I have seen it 3 times already.  The character of Sally Hawkins was my favorite.
user1: me tooo
user1: I've seen a few movies with her and this one was my favorite.
user1: i also like Octavia Spencer
user2: So BEautiful.
user2: Octavia was a little creepy for me.
user1: but she played her role very well
user1: i liked that it was a different love story
user2: Love makes monsters of us all.
user1: true, or turns monsters into good people
user2: True as well.
user2: Was it a box office success?
user1: of course.
user1: i liked the part where she "kidnapped" the creature and kept it in her bathtub :))))
user2: I think she could have had a better plan, but it fit the story
user2: Why not just transport to the harbor?
user1: the movie whould ended to fast :))
user2: I guess, it was suspensful
user1: i felt bad about the cat....
user2: Why didn't he heal the cat also?
user1: good question...
user1: i liked the end where they lived"happily ever after"
user2: I liked the sex scene, so romantic.
user1: and when the bathroon fills completly with water
user2: A long time to hold your breath. 
user1: i was kind a happy when Strickland died
user2: The bad guy always gets it in the end.
user1: i was interesting when she started to breathe through gills
user2: I couldn't beile that.
user1: Giles was a good friend
user2: yes, but i think they could have fed the thing better.
user1: probably
user2: poor cat

user2: Great!
user2: Great concept
user1: What do you think about it? 
user2: I totally loved it
user2: great writers
user1: Yes, I really loved the use of music, and also how they made you care for the creature
user2: I couldn't agree more 
user1: I also really enjoyed that the main character was mute. I think that added something interesting to the film that we don't normally see in big movies like that.
user2: How people can connect to creatures too if we are kind enoughto listen
user2: Yes agree
user1: Do you think that it deserved to win best picture at the Oscars or is there a film you would rather have seen win?
user2: I agree it totally deserved 
user2: I didnt watched oscars
user1: My personal favorite movie last year was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.
user2: But I sense It was best sci fi in this year for sure
user2: Havent seen 
user2: Will surely look though
user1: Yes, please do! It's a great, weird movie and worth giving a shot.
user2: I like sci fi like shape of waters. But hey sure will try

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello!
user2: how are you? this movie seems weird
user2: How funny "a humanoid amphibian creature".Interesting love interests
user1: I think it will be pretty good just based on the director
user2: I wonder what else he has directed?
user1: He's very popular but I can't recall any of his other work at the moment
user2: The ratings are pretty good. Do u know what the metacritic score is?
user1: It is 87 out of 100. Very good
user1: And a 92 percent on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Is that a website?
user1: Yeah, it one of the more (if not most) respected of the review websites
user1: The facility where this individual works apparently receives a creature that has been captured for study, and he falls in love with it
user2: So it looks like this movie was based in the 1960's. I think anything to do with the Cold War era and weird laboratory creatures goes together brilliantly! 
user2: Theres something about the cold war that makes me think of shady unorthodox medical and science experiments.
user1: Agreed! Are you familiar with any of the actors in the cast?
user1: Me too. Aliens and UFO's and soviet spacecraft
user2: No not at all. The Vanessa Taylor seems familiar.. not sure though
user2: Wow she keeps it in her bathtub. 
user1: I was excited for it initially, but it sounds a little bit ridiculous now
user1: Very curious about the alien and water sex scene though, of corse
user1: course
user2: Adding salt and water that's love! lol reminds me of the Tom Hanks movie Splash where he falls for a mermaid. 
user2: Yea I agree
user2: Kinda silly
user2: Ew it was eating cats! 

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: What movie did you see?
user2: Hi; nice to meet you!
user2: "The Shape of Water." Have you seen it yet?
user1: Same here!  No, not yet. How was it?
user2: I was already a fan of Benicio del Toro's...he's the director and one of the writers...and this movie does not disappoint!
user1: Glad to hear it.  I was thinking about watching it but don't know what it's about.
user1: After all, water takes on the shape of whatever, right?
user2: Basically, there's a secret government lab in the 1960s...that's always a good set-up for a movie, don't you think?
user2: I don't think the title is specific to what actually happens in the movie.
user1: Agreed!
user1: Nothing like secret government labs.
user2: There's a mute girl working as a cleaner there and she gets herself involved with what's going on. I'm guessing she doesn't intend to.
user1: Was it in the U.S. or overseas?
user2: Here in the USA during the Cold War
user2: There's a creature but I don't think this is really what you could call a typical monster movie.
user1: Oh cool.  Russian subs off the coast and Bay of Pigs stuff.
user2: Not really....  ;)
user1: Was it experiments on people or something like that?
user2: The creature's from a South American river and has been brought to the secret lab to be studies.
user2: studied...
user1: Oh.  Got it.
user2: That never goes well, does it? Secret labs usually want to do something horrible to such things.
user1: Lots of scary stuff down there in South America.
user2: Anyways, I think it's more a love story...just with a strange setting.
user2: Have you seen anything else Benicio del Toro has done? 
user1: No, what happened to the mute girl?
user2: Netflix has a so-called kid's cartoon he did about trolls that is REMARKABLE...great story and beautifully rendered animation. Del Toro has range!
user2: Oh, that would be telling! 
user2: Although I hope she doesn't get devoured! LOL!
user1: No fun!
user2: Sorry *shrugs* Rules of this game...
user1: Well what happens to the river monster?
user2: Hold on, please...  ;)
user1: Drum roll.
user2: Hold on, please!
user1: Da Da Da Dum.
user1: The music gets louder and faster....
user2: LOL! They gave me a bunch of stuff to read!
user1: And the verdict is....
user2: So there's this bad-guy foreign dude who wants to do something to the creature...
user2: How fun...did you ever see "Splash" where Tom Hanks keeps the mermaid in his bathtub?
user2: The mute girl adopts the creature and keeps it in her bathtub!
user2: I guess taking it out for walkies would be difficult!
user1: Ok I guess I have to watch the movie.  No, I missed that one too!  It's been fun chatting!  Don't forget to check the bathrtub!!
user1: *bathtub.
user2: You, too!
user1: Okay, bye and have a great night

conversation:
user2: Hi. What movie have you read about?
user1: The shape of water

user1: Very interesting movie about a mute custodian working at top secret gov. Laboratory
user1: Its directed by Guillermo del Toro
user1: Sound like something you'd want to see?
user1: Are you there?
user2: I know nothing about it at all.
user1: Do you like the fantasy/ drama genre?

conversation:
user2: hi there
user2: how are you
user1: I'm great!
user1: Hope you are good too. 
user2: do you want to talk about movies
user1: Sure. I just watched the shape of water and it was awesome
user1: unexpectedly...
user2: me too
user2: and as far as it is shown it has a goot rating
user2: it have a high rate of 8.4 form 10 
user1: Yes!  This story had the potential to be crap.. lol 
user1: the director did a great job
user2: yeah a great fanatsy
user1: I like all the actors
user2: the movie got a good critical reviews
user2: yeap Sally Hawkins is very good
user1: Yes. I'm not that clear on the mentally handicapped review 
user2: i have read a lot of critical responses to this movie
user1: ok. So, did you read about it before watching it?
user2: it has an elegant and mesmerizing message
user2: yes of course i barely waited for this movie
user1: i like to old feel. 1962
user1: haha
user2: because the love that it is between a creature and a human one is  fabulous
user1: yes! It's all about perspective. 
user1: I like the title too for that reason. 
user2: this movie got an 87 from 100 scores at Metacitric
user1: water has not shape, it's however you want to contain it. 
user2: yeap but it is subjective
user2: and the role of Elisa Esposito was well created for this fantastic movie
user1: Yes indeed.  I loved how complex the characters were
user1: every story was compelling 
user2: and this creature has the human feelings that are awesome
user1: yes! 
user2: and the part of the sex shows
user2: how a creature and a human can be reached together :P
user1: that's crazy, but beautiful 
user2: Does Del Toro know about Rivers of South America
user1: Lol. I've never been. Well it was great talking with you. 
user1: have a great day! 
user2: that hi implemented such a thing inspiring for a great movie
user2: thank you.
user2: you have a nice one too

conversation:
user2: Hi.
user2: I already read the doc. Let me know when you are ready..
user1: Hi
user2: :-)
user1: I'm ready to go
user2: Pretty amazing movie, huh? A woman falling in love with a merman-type thing.
user1: Definitely original
user2: Why do you think they put in the Soviet spy bit?
user1: I have no idea. It does seem to be a lot going on as far as the plot goes
user1: Maybe a little over the top
user2: Yeah, maybe too much. But I liked it. And obviously a lot of people did, with that 92% rating.
user1: There are some good actors and it seems like it would keep me interested for sure
user2: And a closeted gay guy! My goodness, they hit every note.
user1: They did!
user2: Wonder why she has wounds on her neck by the river ... That's weird.
user1: It is. I am curious about the amphibian creature. Was a normal prisoner to boring? lol
user2: Haha! Good question. It's like it's a bit overdone. But I'm a sucker for fantasy and love del Toro's style, soo.... <shrug>
user2: What's the salt in the water about? Maybe the South American river he came from was an estuary.
user1: I agree, I'd definitely watch it. They do say it has "tenderness uncommon to Del Toro films"
user2: And the thing heals, too. ... Suprised they didn't make him an alien as well.
user1: That is very possible
user2: Wonder what we could add to this movie to make it more crazy. :-)
user1: Well it does grow hair back and heals its wounds
user2: Well, there you go. The scar turns into gills. ... 
user1: Wow he changed her! I don't think we could make it more interesting
user2: I do! 1962 in Baltimore ... I'd have him somehow be important in a Civil Rights march.
user2: Or meet the Beatles.
user1: That would be great! 
user1: Makes me wonder how people come up with this stuff
user2: AND maybe I'd get John Waters to direct. He always puts his movies in Baltimore.
user1: Guess I'm just not that creative
user2: Yeah, amazing. Such creativity to these writers. Hilarious. Such a beautiful movie, but the more I talk about it, the sillier it seems.
user2: Best not to think that much.
user1: It really does
user1: This is definitely an escape reality movie
user2: Oh yes. 
user1: I do wonder how they communicate.... 
user2: Good question!
user2: "ET go hooooome!!!"
user1: Lol
user2: OK, we have lots of back and forth. Shall we "Finish Conversation"? Or is there some rule?
user1: I think we can. I'm pretty sure we met the qualifications :)
user2: (y) Lovely chatting. Bye.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello
user1: Have you seen this movie yet?
user2: No, I have not even heard of it. Have you?
user1: I have heard of it, but haven't seen it yet
user1: I have been told its worth watching though
user2: I have been told that too. 
user1: Are you a fan of del Torro's other works? some of them are a bit out there
user2: I dont think I have ever seen any others
user1: He actually has done far more than most people think...I think. 
user2: I will have to look that up and see what all he has done
user1: I probably will wait to watch it on demand at this point but I think the story line is interesting
user2: This movie has pretty good scoring on the ratings too
user1: It won a bunch of awards too I believe
user1: I have a friend who is deaf so this movie really interested in them.
user2: wow sounds really good then
user2: sounds like a very good story line
user1: I think it could be. 
user1: It almost seems like something that would be based on a book. Do you know if it was?
user2: I'm going to have to check out the trailer of this later on so i  can see what it's all about again in action
user2: I thought that i heard it was, but i'm reading this and it doesn't mention a book
user1: Thats what I was thinking too
user2: it would be a good book if it was from one
user1: It would seem like it would be a book first. Plots like this rarely go straight to movie it seems
user1: I think it would be too. If so I want to read the book first
user2: i just realized it was set in baltimore - i grew up there
user2: i wonder if the scenes are from it too
user1: Oh very cool.
user1: I would think so...though its set in the 60's so I would image they would have remade the sets
user1: I have heard the special effects are pretty amazing
user1: Are you still there?
user1: I would like to see the movie for sure
user1: I have to go check though when its coming out...want to read the book first

conversation:
user2: Have you seen this movie?
user2: I watched it once with some friends, but I want to watch it again when I am alone so I can really pay more attention to it.
user2: I like Michael Shannon a lot, but he played a real prick in this movie.
user1: Yes, I thought the movie was interesting and thought-provoking.
user2: It really makes you feel sorry for the creature.
user1: I would like to watch it again
user1: Agreed.
user2: Yes, me too
user1: It's a telling story about how love is love, regardless of how conventional it is.
user1: Even that it's not confined to just humans.
user1: It's a great message
user2: Very true, it was a beautiful movie.
user1: It's heartbreaking that people in real life don't accept people or things for what they are.
user1: Tell me more about what you thought of Michael Stuhlbarg's character?
user1: I'm sorry, Michael Shannon.
user1: You mentioned his character was an asshole.
user2: I like Michal Shannon a lot, but I hated his character, but I guess he did his job well.
user1: Right, if you hate him in the film that's a sign of a really good actor ;)
user2: I'm just glad it had a good ending.
user1: Interesting that it was set in the Cold War era
user2: It's hard to understand why quality movies like this don't do better at the box office.
user1: Also given that it was a recent release, cool to see the production from modern day film showing something of the past.
user2: I agree
user1: It's hard.. I think it's kind of an inside job.
user1: There's a lot behind scenes about movie promotion that we as civilians don't hear about.
user2: Yea, all in the promotion I guess
user1: The film industry is as corrupt as anything, haha
user2: yes, it's too bad too.  We could probably see a lot better filmss if that wasn't the case
user1: I just try not to go off of popular rankings.
user1: I forget, how did Elisa go from visiting the creature in secret to keeping him in her bathtub?
user1: He escaped?
user2: Her friend, the older gentleman helped her break it out, and the spy ended up helping too
user2: You know whats funny, at first I thought the older guy who is her friend was Bruce Campbell
user1: Ahhh
user2: The spy was suppose to kill it, but he didn't want to do it
user2: He wasn't in the plan to help them, it just kind of worked out that way
user1: I see
user1: Adds to the mystery
user2: indeed
user2: I really enjoyed it though, one of the best movies Iv'e seen in a while
user1: It's neat how they incorporate the element of water
user2: yes it was, the whole movie was interesting and original.  Something you don't get much of these days.
user1: And a cool fantasy/sci-fi touch on a historic time period
user1: Very artistic
user2: Every character had their own little quirks too, which was pretty cool as well
user1: Right
user1: Well, thanks for talking about it
user1: Cool to discuss
user1: I'd watch it again
user2: Same, nice talking with you also
user1: I don't know too much about the director but I'd be interested in checking out his other films.
user1: I think that's the end of the document...
user2: I'm not sure who directed and produced it, but I would like to check out some of their other stuff as well
user1: Do you think there's a possibility for a sequel?
user1: It would probably have had to be a bigger hit.....
user2: I'm not sure, but I'd love to see it if they do it
user1: Maybe it's not so "happily ever after" after all
user1: Haha
user2: You never know, maybe it's better left to be a mystery
user1: Yes
user1: I guess you're right
user1: I haven't done one of these discussions before
user1: Do we keep discussing until it's over or do we manually hit "finish conversation?"
user1: haha I have no idea
user2: I don't know
user1: Interesting...
user2: You would think there would be a timer or something

conversation:
user1: Hey there
user1: How are you?
user2: great and you?
user1: Pretty good
user1: Got any questions?
user2: yes I do 
user1: What do you want to know?
user2: I wanted to know about the movie "the shape of water"
user1: What about it?
user2: apologies as my browser is loading pretty slowly
user1: No worries! I'll tell you a little bit
user1: There are a lot of plot points, but on it's most basic level it is a fantastical love story.
user2: well what is it about? I really like dramas and really psychological movies
user2: oh nice nice and who stars in it?
user1: sally hawkins, michael shannon, and richard jenkins are the main stars
user1: you'd really like it! It's basically a story of a mute custodian at a high-security government lab. 
user2: Big Michael Shannon fan myself
user1: I won't give you too many more details, but that pretty much outlines it.
user2: haha I'm interested already
user1: Yeah! What else do you want to know?
user2: cool cool
user2: could you recommend another movie?
user1: Hmmm, something like this one?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user1: I didn't get the document for what movie we should be discussing.
user2: Hi. Have you seen The Shape of Water?
user1: No. I've never heard of it
user1: Could you tell me about it?
user2: It is a Fantasy Drama movie that cam out in 2017. It was a good movie and given a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: That's a good rating. Who are the actors?
user2: It stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannnon, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, Michael Stuhibarg, and Octavia Spencer.
user2: It is directed by Guillermo del Toro.
user1: Wow I haven't heard of any of them.
user2: Yeah. It is a bunch of new actors in it. The story is set in 1962 and is about a mute custodian at a government laboratory who falls in love with a humanoid amphibian creature that the laboratory captured.
user1: Kinda sounds like scifi 
user1: wow does sound like a weird movie to me
user1: so what else happens?
user2: Yeah it does but that don't classify it as that at all. It starts off with the main character, Elisa Esposito, who is played by Sally Hawkins, back story. She is an orphaned child who was found in a river with wounds in her neck and communicates through sign language because she is mute. 
user2: It shows her life alone inf her apartment above the a cinema and her job as a cleaning women at the top secret government laboratory I mentioned earlier. 
user1: Ok. I'm sorry I can't discuss this back and forth with you. I don't know why I don't have the document.
user1: and that's where she meets the creature?
user2: Its OK. Let me tell you more. You learn about her friends. One is her neighbor named Giles and the other is a co-worker of hers named Zelda who also helps interpret for her at work. 
user1: ok
user2: Yes. She meets the creature one night when the facility receives a mysterious creature from the South American river and she goes to see what it is because she is curious and soon forms a bond with it after visiting it in secret. 
user2: Sorry. I can not type very fast.
user1: It's ok. No worries
user2: She soon takes the creature to her home and keeps it alive in her bathtub with salt water and plans a way to release it back to its home. 
user2: Soon Richard Strickland, the one who captured the creature, tries to interrogate Elisa and Zelda about were it could be and that goes no were for him.
user1: So is the creature the size of a human?
user2: Yes. The creature gets out of her bathroom at one point and scratches her friend and neighbor Giles but she finds it in the cinema below her apartment and brings it back. The creature then feels bad and heals Giles arm with just a touch.
user1: That sounds very interesting
user2: Yeah. Soon Strickland is given a timeline to find the creature, 36 hours to be exact, and he soon finds out that Elisa is has been keeping the creature at her house. 
user2: Strickland searches Elisa house and finds a note on her calendar of when and she plans to release the creature and set it free. 
user1: This is getting better and better. I'm dying to find out the rest lol.
user2: Ha ha. He goes after her and finds her and Giles at the canal they plan to release the creature and shoots at them, hitting Elisa and the creature. 
user1: Oh no!
user2: It appears that Strickland has killed them both but then the creature drags Elisa with him under the water and heals himself and her. He also heals the scares on her neck and they somehow become gills so she can breathe underwater. They live happily ever after under the water together. 
user2: The end lol. Thanks for being patient and letting my type.
user2: Bye
user1: Bye!

conversation:
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1: Great. How are you today?
user2: Doing fine over here! Hey, have you seen The Shape of Water?
user1: I havent. I've wanted to see it. I have a few friends that have watched it and they liked it.
user1: What about you?
user2: I have, and let me tell you are missing something really good! What have you heard about it?
user1: ACtually I have watched this. Its a great movie. I love movies set in the 1960's. It gives me a nostalgic feeling. I like any movies dealing with sci fi type stuff. There is nothing short of that in this film.
user2: What do you like the most about it?
user1: The ending when the creature kills strickland. 
user2: Do you know there's a theory where Strickland is left alive and mute because of his injuries?
user1: I didn't. What did you think of Elisa as a character?
user2: It's great, I think. It's a rare character and that makes her ideal to become so attached to a creature that's also rare
user2: And what about Sally Hawins performance?
user1: Yes. I agree. She did a wonderful job. I couldnt imagine growing up at that period completely deaf to the outside world. 
user2: Yeah, it's amazing. And what is your favorite scene?
user1: When Elisa discovers the creature it was pretty amazing. I couldnt imagine what she was thinking at that point.
user2: Agreed. But don't you think the movie maybe lacked a scene more or two where we can perceive the creature's intelligence?
user1: Yes. I do. I was curious as to what it was actually processing most of the movie. What do you think was going through the creatures mind when Elisa first took it to her home?
user1: Are you still with me?
user2: He must have felt appreciated, but also a bit underwhelmed that they aren't releasing him to the world, but rather having him in a secluded  bathroom
user1: I have to ask. If you were in that situation do you think you wouldve went all the way with the creature? As in have sex with it?
user2: I think not. And I think for the most part it's because we are not conscious of how intelligent the creature is. Is it having sex because he's falling in love? Is it just animal instincts?
user1: Yea that I don't know. Definitely a gross scene to me. I couldn't imagine that haha. 
user1: What did you think of Strickland? Di you hate his character or was he just a guy doing his job?
user2: Hahaha, well they didn't make as gross as it could be, but it definitely was very "WTF?"
user2: Strickland was a great character. He's just a cynic and outcome-centric man. He's not there to think about the creature itself, but of how the creature can contribute in the winning of the cold war. He isn't even that focused on it, but more on achieving what's expected of him.
user2: Did you like his character?
user1: Yeah. You feel for the guy because he is ultimately a military man. Hes doing what training has told him to do.
user2: Exactly! He's willing to go as far as he needs to go to fulfill his duty
user2: Is there any criticism you have for the movie?
user1: The sex scene was probably the biggest turnoff for me. Other than that it was really well done. 
user2: Yeah, that went too far. It might have been better if it was insinuated rather than shown
user1: I agree on that part. 
user1: Did you like the ending?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user2: I would love to kow have you seen shape of water?
user2: know not kow
user2: lol
user1: I have seen it.
user2: Guillermo del Toro did a great job directing it.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Yes
user2: I think you should rewatch it again.
user2: I really loved the fanatasy drama so different and unique.
user1: I've seen it twice, but I wasn't impressed by Michael Shannon in it.
user2: Wow really?
user1: Yeah, and I felt that the fantasy wasn't really all there.
user2: I thought he did a good job as being corupt and creepy.
user2: hmm interesting
user2: Sally Hawkins was wonderful as Elisa.
user2: agreed?
user1: She did do a very good job.
user2: It was probably difficult to express somuch without being able to speak.
user2: Playing a mute is hard,at least i think so.
user1: I bet, do you think she had to learn how to sign?
user2: I am sure.
user2: Or maybe she already knew... who knows.
user1: How do you like the set designs?
user2: I thought they did a great job, i loved the secret lab.
user2: I also thought it was a cool depiciton of Baltimore.
user2: did you like them?
user1: I thought at times they were really well done, but some times they didn't feel like the right time era
user2: I am not expert on that so maybe clueless, and so in this case ignorance was bliss.
user2: I think the 92% from rotten tomatoes was deserved.
user1: Yeah, I think overall the film was well rounded and a good time
user2: ya the critical acclaim is deserved.
user2: one said it was elegant and mesmerizing and I agree.
user2: I also really thought Richard Jenkins was wonderful as Giles the nieghbor.
user1: Yeah, I wished there was more of him.
user1: The end of the film was more violent then I though it was going to be, how did you feel about it
user2: Maybe.. I do think they pieced it all together well.
user2: I think it needed some climax
user2: And also gave way to the whole ending.
user2: I really liked when the scars on her neck became gills.
user1: That was a little confusing for me.
user1: Are we meant to assume that's what her scars were the whole time
user2: They were there from the start of th emovie.
user2: she was found as childin the river with wounds on her neck
user1: Right, but do you think they became gills only after meeting the creature and he touched her?
user2: yes
user2: but I think she was maybe formthe water kingdom originally
user2: but that is my impression.
user1: I could see that.

conversation:
user1: Have you ever seen a Toro Film?
user2: I have. This one here is listed as a fantasy, drama. Based on the information given would you agree?
user1: yes, what about you?
user2: I would. It also recieves a 92% from Rotten Tomatoes. That definitely peaks my interest
user1: The film is very similar to del toros other films as well.
user2: It states in the critical response that it is one of his most stunning. Based off of what I have seen from him that is really saying something!
user1: yeah, and set in an earlier era. very interesting
user2: Yea I see it is set in 1962. I really enjoy the aesthetics of the era. To set it in a high-security government facility is pretty adventurous. 
user2: Must have taken a lot of work on set
user1: creative, and feeds into our fears about the government
user2: Yes and a mute working in the labratory, how perfect. No one to tell her secrets too! In a sense. 
user1: true, It's set in the cold war as well, where secrets were very important. 
user2: It shows that Zelda is played by Octavia Spencer. I really enjoy her acting. Who would your favorite actor/actress be as listed here?
user1: I don't know any of them, except for the director and shannon so I can't say
user1: Would you say this film is similar to his others?
user2: She is a very good actress. So a humanoid amphibian...ever seen anything like described here? Makes me curious to see this movie. I would say from the description the movie sounds different
user2: So not only does she bond with this creature, Elisa keeps it in her bathtub!
user1: That's odd but that's typical of his films
user2: The scratch that miraculously healed, wonder what that's about?
user1: That's interesting.Maybe it has to do with the government experiements
user1: What do you think of corrupt military and governments in the movie?
user2: Possibly. But it doesn't state anything about the government being corrupt. I do think the situation is interesting.  Also in the Critical Response, I read Sally Hawkins character, Elisa is "mentally handicapped". To bond with a creature and get it out of that lab she has to be smart. I disagree.
user1: I agree, but in those times many people were considered handicapped in some way.
user1: the mute, is an orphan and it seems like del toro features similar characters in his works
user2: Ah you make a good point there. I guess back then she would be considered handicapped. 
user1: the creature isn't so nice either, eating cats
user2: Well yes and no. Not really nice but I mean what else was it gonna eat. I assume no on ereally knows its diet. It kinda sounds funny in a way
user1: true, we don't really know much about the creature
user1: the movie is going to be annoying with so much sign language though
user2: I know for some it may be but I don't mind it so much. I am learning with my child to be proficient in ASL. Definitely an acquired taste, however.
user2: The creature begins to get sick. I wonder if that is because he is out of his home enviornment. So many unanswered questions!
user1: Oh, I see. Overall, it's an interesting movie and it's been interesting chatting. Regards

conversation:
user1: Hello, we are supposed to talk about the Shape of Water
user1: First of all, did you like it?
user2: I did like the movie it was a great fantasy movie. How about you?
user1: I also liked it a lot, the script and actors were really good
user2: I really like Guillermo del Toro's work; What was your favorite thing about the movie?\
user1: I really loved the special effects, the opening scene was my favourite
user1: What about you?
user1: What was your favorite thing about the movie?
user2: It was a very interesting movie, I liked the story line and it was different from other movies.
user1: Yeah that's true
user1: And what do you think about Sally Hawkins the main actress?
user2: I really liked her performance, she was very convincing, her performance pulled at the heart strings.
user1: Yeah she is a really good actress
user1: And what are your thoughts about Guillermo del Toro as a director
user2: I really like his work; he has a variety of movies and I like them all. What about you?
user1: I admire him, I consider Guillermo as one of the best directors for fantasy movies
user1: Also I just reviewed in the document that the movie got a score of 92% in Rotten Tomatoes, do you think this score is fair?
user2: Yes; I think that is a fair and accurate score.
user1: Yeah I thought the same, considering rotten tomatoes is harsh on most movies
user1: What do you think about Strickland?
user2: I think that he is a good Character actor and plays police and military personnel very well. 
user1: Yeah he is good, and funny sometimes
user1: And what about Giles, Elisa's friend?
user2: Giles performance was good as well. The movie had many twists; I usually figure out what is coming in a movie. I was quite surprised with this movie, do you agree?
user1: Yeah I also agree it was different from other movies
user1: Although the dancing scene is kind of awkward don't you agree?
user2: Yes I agree, how do you feel about the use of sign language?
user1: It was a feature nicely implemented in the movie and the actress was really good at it
user2: Yes she was very convincing. Did you like how dark the movie was at times?
user1: Yeah I did it was really nice, mainly the underwater scenes don't you think?
user2: Yes it added interest
user1: Now about the key scenes shown in the document, what you think about scene number 3
user1: ?
user1: I liked how Strickland perfect world was falling apart after he couldnt find the creature
user2: It was a surprising plot twist that I did not see coming. I grew to hate Strickland's character in the movie and he got what he deserved. They had made reference to her scars previously and she had been found by a river; but I still did not see that coming. What is your opinion?
user1: Yeah as I was saying I loved how Strickland perfect world was falling apart after he couldn't find the creature. But yeah I totally agree he got what he deserved
user1: Whats your opinion about the critical response that the movie got in general
user1: ?
user2: Usually I don't follow or agree with most critics, but I think that I agree with them. It was a weird and wonderful movie.
user1: Yeah thats true I think the same
user1: And whats do you think about Octavias Spencer's role on the movie?
user2: I am familiar with her as an actress and I think that she played an important part to in the movie as the interpreter. She was kind of a motherly figure in Elisa's life.
user1: Yeah that's true although I think it was a big cliché in the movie. But her performance was really good

conversation:
user2: I really want to see this movie. 
user1: Have you seen the Rotten Tomatoes score for this movie? It's insane!
user1: I'm hoping to see it soon too
user1: I've heard great things about it
user2: That is a really high Tomatometer rating. I"m impressed.
user1: Guillermo del Toro is supposed to be a great director.
user2: I love Del Toro's work
user1: What do you think of the cast?
user1: The ratings for this film are wonderful!
user2: I don't think I'm too familiar with Sally Hawkins or Michael Shannon, but I love Octavia Spencer and Doug Jones (who should've been listed. And awarded)
user1: I can't believe it was only made in 2017.
user1: Ahh, I like Sally Hawkins.
user1: She is very interesting.
user2: She seems to have gotten the signing down really well. 
user1: Yeah
user1: She did really well
user1: I wonder what it must have felt like, playing a mute character
user2: I"m sure it was a struggle at first
user1: The relationship dynamic was interesting too. 
user2: People have poked fun at it, but I'm sure it's very sweet
user1: Yeah
user2: Doug Jones is a master at conveying emotion through all that makeup
user1: Oh yeah, the way they do makeup now-a-days is incredible
user1: Keeping the creature in her bathtub sounds like a very inventive idea, what did you think of it?
user2: It reminds me of Splash. I think they put Daryl Hannah in the tub at some point. 
user2: Flooding the whole bathroom sounds challenging.
user1: Oh yeah.
user1: Have you seen Stranger Things?
user1: *The It Movie
user2: Yes, I enjoy that show
user1: They have a challenging scene in that movie as well
user1: With bloody walls
user2: I wouldn't want to clean that up
user1: Neither would I.
user1: This movie turned quite violent towards the end.
user1: I'm not sure I would enjoy that.
user1: At least the relationship is positive, even in the end.
user1: What an interesting "happily ever after."
user2: She gets gills. Hunh. Kind of like SHrek with the princess becoming an ogre
user1: That's a hilarious comparison.
user1: Good job.
user1: It seems fitting.
user2: I like a fantasy tale with a twist. 
user1: Don't we all.
user1: Grimm fairytales are great too.
user1: It was nice chatting with you.
user2: Ehh... the Grimms kind of did a bad job with the tales
user2: Nice to chat with you too

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you seen this movie?
user2: No, it looks pretty boring.
user2: But I like foreign movies.
user1: It was pretty good actually
user1: I am a hard sell on movies these days, but I liked it
user1: I did not like this director's past movies, though.
user2: It's all in Russia?
user1: but I like the lead woman, sally Hawkins, so I gave it a chance.
user1: No, it's iin the U.S.
user2: Okay, I've never heard of any of these people.
user2: So I might be suprised.
user1: It's a fantasy where this woman who cannot speak but can hear is a cleaner for a science lab, it's in the 60's.
user1: so they have an amphibious man creature they
user1: they've captured and she falls in love with it and vice versa.
user1: it turns out to be a god sort of
user1: anyway it was good.
user2: Alright
user1: It's kind of sad, lots of sad stories in it about the different people, the bad guy who wants to disect the creature, the neighbor who helps her get it out of the facility, the main woman who was abused as a child and found deserted, the creature who was happily swimming along in a south american river apparently and then got captured and treated bad.
user1: I like richard Jenkins a lot
user1: he plays the neighbor
user1: you'd know him if you saw his face.
user1: so not too chatty, eh?
user1: doing other hits? lol
user2: Well it's just really hard to fit everything on one screen.
user1: ok
user2: Also, I never saw the movie.
user1: you're supposed to read the article and talk about it.
user2: Yeah, I saw another movie that reminded me about this one.
user2: And it was no good.
user1: it's kind of a creature from the black lagoon type creature.
user2: But this is a little better.
user1: i find it interesting that they don't seem to mention the guy who plays the creature.
user2: She falls in love with an animal?
user2: Or is it a man?
user1: he's an amphibianman
user1: kind of an animal
user1: i think I've "fallen in love" with a few animals in my time.
user1: kind of a beauty and the beast
user2: Yeah, I liked my cat. Oh, I see.
user1: except at the end she goes with him back to his home.
user1: or so the guy telling the story, the neighbor, wants to believe.
user2: It keeps changing pages for me.
user1: in truth she gets killed and the creature, who can heal people, picks her up and jumps int he water with her so we don't actually know what happened.
user1: fairy tale
user2: How tragic.
user1: lol yeah kind of
user2: So like little mermaid but reverse
user1: i was kind of disappointed that the creature killed the bad guy
user1: i wanted him to let him live, you know, be above the human behavior.
user1: at one point the creature eats a cat.
user2: No!
user1: that was tough for me, i have cats.
user1: lol yeah
user2: I don't have cats anymore
user1: hey, he was hungry.
user1: i work with a woman from viet nam who talks about eating cats, lol, i never know if she's kidding or not, she loves cats but maybe
user2: It's kinda believable with the sign language, sounds like monkeys.
user1: yeah, she knows sign language i forgot that 
user1: it's a love story
user2: I would not love an amphibian.
user2: Maybe that's part of it
user2: She sounded like a bit of an outcast.
user1: she has "physical relations" with him, they show it! It's sort of beautiful, I mean, they don't show it like graphically, but they show them naked together. 
user2: But that makes a good love story when you have two loner people and just make a story about them.
user1: yeah, it was about everybody in it, that guy is a good story teller, he did Pan's Labyrinth.
user1: which I didn't like because it was too dark.
user1: I am hungry, these cats are starting to look pretty tasty. lol
user2: Yeah, I like sci fi, but not love stories much.
user2: And not stuff where there is someone who you're supposed to feel sorry for.
user2: Or any of those prison movies.
user2: Which I thought that's what it was at first.
user2: But she's just a mute.
user1: well, it is sci fi
user1: she is mute but she can hear.
user2: Okay.
user2: I've worked with a couple deaf people.
user2: And hey preferred to sign.
user1: i don't know if I felt sorry for any of them except the bad guy, he was a tortured soul.
user1: at the end I wanted the creature to heal him so he'd be good maybe
user2: I like stories where it's not really a good or bad guy.
user1: but he didn't, he killed him
user2: And you can see the point of view of the bad guy too.
user1: yeah, it was like that
user1: he was just sucked into a way of thinking that he couldn't let go of.
user2: Why did the bad guy hate the creature?
user1: scarcity thinking
user1: he was ex military
user2: He wanted to slay the dragon.
user1: he was religious, christian for one thing, and thought anything not human wasn't worth caring about. a lot of christians misinterpret the bible that way.
user1: and he was ex military cia kind of thing, trying to get a promotion
user1: he was conflicted.
user2: Okay.
user2: That's pretty messed up.
user1: it woud've been better if the creature would've healed him.
user1: then it would
user1: have maybe changed the way he thought
user1: only thing i would've changed about the movie.
user2: I'm not sure I get the story. But I know what it's like to want to get a promotion.
user2: And then you forget about everything else for a while
user1: yeah, me, too, but I won't compromise my principles to do it.
user2: And then everything besides your job starts to have problems.
user1: but then I'm old so I'm not so much influenced anymore by greed and wanting to advance.
user2: Yeah, there's a lot of gray area.
user1: on my head! lol
user2: So two people might have a very different view on the same thing.
user2: haha.
user1: well, yeah
user1: yep yep yep
user1: I always want the bad people to transform, like our political leaders for instance!
user2: I don't think there's anything in the Bible about killing amphibians.
user1: lolol
user1: no, it says we have dominion over all the animals, some people think that means we can do anythin to them we want, I think it means we have to take care of them.
user1: are you sure it doesn't say anything about that?
user1: lol
user2: I think you have to say what you think about the Bible in the first place.
user1: what do you think about it?
user2: Because I don't think it's a list of rules God handed everyone exactly
user1: truth, fiction?
user2: do you mean the bible or?
user1: yeah, the bible
user2: So I haven't really reasearched it that much.
user2: But it's not what I used to think it was.
user2: A lot of it is just letters to people.
user2: And along the way, people decided to put them in.
user1: yeah, it's just a history book
user2: Also, people take it literally.
user1: history is just somebody's story about what happened
user2: Like try to read into it too much about science.
user1: a lot of people read it because it's one of the few documents we have in tact from that long ago.
user1: I've known a lot of athiests who had read the whole thing because it's a history book.
user1: hey our time is up, nice talking to you.
user2: ok bye.

user1: I don;t recogize any of those  
user1: it sounds like it is............this creature does it have a name?
user2: They are very well cast
user2: The creature does not have a name
user1: okay it really is ugly or what?
user2: There is one scene where the creature has been rescued and he is at the apartment of one of their rescuers and it eats a pet cat
user1: ughh  sounds gross!!
user2: It is an amphibious creature, so ugly is in the eye of the beholder
user1: okay

user1: Is the creature the shape of water
user2: It got a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Water has no shape lo
user2: *lol

user2: I think the title is just a reference to the creature being amphibiuos
user1: okay well thanks for you view
user2: I hope you go and see it, I think you will be pleasantly suprised
user1: okay thank you again for your info

conversation:
user2: I like this movie,It's very interesting.
user1: It is!
user1: Who is your favorite character?
user2: Elisa Esposito, the actress played this part perfectly.
user1: Yes!! Sally Hawkins was amazing!
user1: She is so elegant and expressive
user2: i agree,i wont be surprised if shes nominated for an award.
user1: I also loved her neighbor Giles! His character is the perfect yin to her yang
user1: And Del Toro is an expert storyteller
user2: Totally,Octavia is under-rated in my opinion,del toro is very talented
user1: I didn't love Octavia in this tho. I thought it was pretty generic for her. Not bad, but not Oscar worthy
user2: do you generally choose movies based on rating or genra?
user1: Not based on ratings
user1: What about you?
user2: Ive been a fan od del toro for several years so i chose this film due to that,however i usually choose based on genre
user1: gotcha :)
user1: I chose it after I heard Oscar buzz
user1: I try to make it a point to watch all the nominated films
user2: i heard the critics reviews of this one and i became motivated to not wait on seeing it.
user1: oh really? sometimes that makes me want to see it more, because I often disagree with them
user2: I agree, the fact that this film was one that tugs on the hearts strings i was excited to see how del toro would direct it
user1: How did you like the use of sign language?
user2: it was so fluid ,flowing thru the movie,it sells the character easily,it seems so natural for the actors
user2: do you think the creature was cheesy or believable
user1: I thought it was believeable and I love that actor! 
user1: Kinda bummed they didn't list him on that sheet
user1: I thought the cinematography was gorgeous.
user2: i agree,i found myself rooting for the creature very quicky,
user1: Oh yeah, Strickland was easy to root against
user2: exactly,i love a happily ever after ending 
user1: Me too! And how he turned her scars into gills! swoon!
user1: Do you think Giles thought she survived?
user2: im sure he had to believe in his mind that she did,for his own emotional attachment,it seemed like he also likes happily ever after,i expected Giles to have a romantic interest though.
user1: I mean for all he knew they both went in the water and died
user2: yes i wondered if they left that open in case of sequel

conversation:
user1: Hello, have you seen the shape of water?
user2: I have not yet seen the Shape of water. Have you?
user1: Yes, it's a really good movie. It's a fantasy/drama film
user2: I have heard really good things about it. It's supposed to be Del Toro's most stunningly successful works and I like his other movies
user2: So that gives me a great motivation to see it eventually.
user1: Yes, its a really good one. It's also got really solid ratings. 
user2: The cast seems to be really top notch with a mix of big names and new comers.
user1: Yeah, Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92%, Metacritic gave it a 87% and CinemaScore gave it a A
user2: That is a really good mix of reviews. The plot seems to be very unique and interesting too. All around it sounds enticing.
user1: Yeah, Sally Hawkins in the lead role is great. She plays a mute cleaner who works at this secret government lab who falls in love with this top secret amphibian creature.
user2: It also sets the stage well with orphaned child scene. It leaves a lot to the imagination and lets you really connect with the character.
user1: Yes, they are able to connect really well because she's mute and he's a creature so they commute in a different way.
user1: *communicate
user2: The sign language is a really good tool to use. It also lets kids and adults who communicate through sign language feel more represented in media which isn't always the case.
user1:  The cast is really diverse. Richard Jenkins plays her closeted neighbor who is her best friend, along with Octavia Spenser's character who is her co worker and helps her a lot
user2: The time period is also interesting, setting it during the cold war.
user2: The way she keeps adding salt to the water to make sure the creature lives really shows her character's dedication
user1: Yeah, and she understands him in an unconventional way. 
user2: It's a little unnerving seeing the creature eating a cat though. It leads to the revelation of it's powers but it's still a mixed scene for me.
user1: Yeah, it is a but of a disturbing scene, but luckily they understand that he wasn't really trying to hurt anyone, he just didn't understand and he was hungry.
user2: definitely. It reveals the creature is just being itself and doesn't know any better. They understand that
user1: I know a lot of people had mixed feelings about it, but I did think it was romantic in a way that she flooded her bathroom just so they could be intimate together. 
user2: yeah it was a powerful scene
user2: When the creature starts getting sick it really makes you feel for it.
user1: The villain of the movie, Strickland, is a pretty intimidating antagonist the way he hunts them 
user2: and with how he injures the creature. Thankfully he manages to heal himself
user2: Its wonderful they lived happily ever after though, we rarely get that in movies nowadays.
user1: Yes, and it was good to see the bad guy get what he deserved in the end.
user2: Yes, he got exactly what we all wanted
user1: I loved how he took her into the water and healed her and gave her gills so they could be together

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi there!
user1: This movie was outstanding!
user2: Can you tell me a bit about it?
user1: Sure it is about a mute housekeeper who works at a top secret lab.
user2: What does the lab do?
user1: They have captured an alien creature and are keeping it there to study.  Do you want to know the name of the movie?
user2: yes please
user1: It is The Shape of Water.  It attracted a lot of positive attention for the good critic ratings and reviews.
user2: What did you like about it?
user1: The story of how she falls in love with the creature and how she begins secretly visiting him.  She only communicates through sign language.
user2: oh wow, that does sound really interesting!  
user1: Sally Field plays the cleaning lady.  There is a Russian spy working at the lab, spying on the work the lab is doing with the creature.
user2: I love Sally Field, I think she is a great actress
user1: The creature was discovered in South America.
user1: It is half amphibian half human.
user2: Did it seem to possess a lot of human qualities?
user1: Yes.  ally Field takes the creature to her home, and keeps it alive in the bathtub.
user1: *Sally
user2: Does she have to try to hide it from the authorities?  That sounds like a really intriguing plot. 
user1: Yes!  The man who discovered it is in charge of the research project and he is looking diligently for it.
user1: One of Sally Field's neighbors discovers the creature eating one of his cats.
user2: I bet that would definitely cause some issues!
user1: The creature slashes at his arm and runs away.  Sally Field finds him and takes him back to her apartment.  He touches the neighbors arms where he slashed it and it heals by the next morning.
user2: Oh so the creature has some kind of other-wordly powers?
user1: Yes! The creature also touches his bald head and the hair grows back.
user2: Ahaha that is a bit comedic 
user1: Once Sally Field gets the creature back, the two of them start having sex in her bathtub.
user2: What did you think about their relationship?
user1: Pretty strange.  
user2: Is there any chance for a sequel?  
user1: There is a standoff at the end where the Project Manager battles with the creature, I won't spoil the ending for you.  You really need to see this.  I think there might just be a sequel.
user2: I love movies with sequels!  It definitely sounds like a good mix of drama and action
user2: Thank you for all of the details.  
user1: Its been fun chatting with you.
user2: You as well. 

conversation:
user1: hello 
user2: hello, have you seen The Shape of Water?
user1: yes I saw it literally just now. how about you?
user2: I saw it about a week ago. Did you enjoy it?
user1: no I didn't enjoy it. it seemed like just a showcase of cinematic effects and CGI and I didn't really think the storyline was thoughtful.
user1: I also don't know any of the actors Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, or Michael Stuhlbarg
user2: I'm only familiar with Octavia Spencer. She played Zelda in the film. She's a talented actress. 
user2: Are you familiar with the director, Guillermo de Toro?
user1: No I've never heard of anything else del Toro has directed. I take it you enjoyed the film?
user2: I did enjoy the film but I thought it was a little too predictable. So similar to you, I thought it could have been more thoughtful. 
user1: It received good scores though...92% from Rotten Tomatoes and 87/100 from Metacritic 
user2: Yes, the film has many fans. You wouldn't think it from reading the basic description of a mute custodian who falls in love with an amphibian creature. 
user2: Did you know the premise before you watched it?
user1: I generally don't like coincidental plot or character devices like...why is a mute woman working in such a top secret government facility?
user1: no I didn't know anything about this film. What do you think about the possibility of it being either based on real life or released to discredit us from thinking this could happen in real life?
user2: And at the height of the Cold War too!
user2: All I have to say is that it left me with more questions than answers...if you know what I mean. 
user2: Also, they have a Soviet spy working there at the top secret facility.  
user1: I think I know what you mean...it has some very strange scenes doesn't it?
user2: Yes, it most certainly does.  
user1: Wow it has some very strange scenes indeed...are they trying to promote interspecies relationships or is it an allegory for interracial relationships you think?
user2: I hoped they would also share more about her neighbor, Giles. 
user1: All I know is that he was bald and had good taste in naming cats.
user2: I don't even know. The interspecies element through me for a loop. I think it kind of wanted to shock the audience. 
user2: Ha ha! 
user2: The Giles character had a strong relationship with Elisa (the mute cleaner) but I didn't know why. 
user1: It's definitely shocking but I feel like Hollywood is responsible for putting these kinds of things on the "big screen", which I also think they're not doing so well these days in general.
user2: Elisa keeps the creature in her bathtub but I kept wondering about the amount of salt needed to make a saline environment. Seemed like she would need to strictly measure the salt.
user1: It appears to have had another one of those coincidental, Deus ex Machina endings. The "happily ever after" ending where things happen to line up just right.
user2: I agree that Hollywood isn't doing too well these days. 
user1: I would say it's due to a lack of creativity but this movie seems to be overcompensating for that a little bit!
user1: The making of the saline environment is another one of those coincidental things that happens I was talking about :)
user2: Yes, maybe that's what people are demanding too. Give them a realistic ending and they automatically believe the movie was bad. Doesn't make sense. The character Giles was startled when he found the creature eating his cat, Pandora. I expected him to be more than "startled".
user1: Yeah I feel like realistic endings AND story lines are what Hollywood needs more in it's movies
user2: Yes, and giving an ultimatum of 36 hours seems like a strange number of hours. Anyway, nice chatting with you. Best of luck in whatever you do. 
user1: Yep it was nice chatting. Good to agree on the Hollywood thing and likewise

conversation:
user2: This seems like it might be interesting to watch. 
user1: yeah
user1: good movies
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: drama fantasy
user1: yeah I've watched it 
user1: liked it very much
user2: I've been trying to find the time to watch it. 
user1: one of the best Del Toros works so far
user2: I didn't know it had a 92% rating! 
user1: actor were chosen good as well
user2: I find the title intriguing. 
user1: very good title 
user1: i would say the movie is about love 
user1: and human being 
user2: I love how fantasy films make you fall in love with them while still teaching you life lessons. 
user2: I wonder if this one does the same. 
user2: Oh so I just watched the movie. lol 
user2: Well, you were right it was awesome! 
user2: I found the setting interesting. 1962
user2: I might have thought if this story in a futuristic setting. 
user2: Who was your favorite character?
user2: You still there?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user2: Have you seen and of Guillermi del Toro's movies?
user1: I have seen Pacific Rim and Pan's Labrynth
user2: His films have a fairy tale quality. 
user1: Yes, I would agree with that
user2: His newest film The Shape of Water is no exceptiom
user2: *exception
user1: Oh, I have not seen that yet.  It looks good in the previews. 
user1: what is it about?
user2: Pretty much it's a love story between two outcasts
user2: one is a woman who cannot talk and the other is the mysterious sea creature
user2: or merman ...
user1: That is interesting.  Who plays the lead female role?
user2: Sally Hawkins
user1: I am not sure I know who that is.
user1: Who plays the male lead?
user2: She is amazing in it. I've mostly seen her in indie roles
user2: the sea creature?
user1: Yes.
user1: Or is it CGI?
user2: cgi i beleive
user2: The set design is amazing
user2: though it does look a bit like that video game BioShock
user2: sort of post wwII steampunk
user1: That sounds cool,  I am familiar with what Bioshock looks like.  That makes me more interested in seeing it.
user2: The set alone and the imagery alone are worth watching it for
user1: What kind of ratings did it receive?
user2: Well it won best picture
user2: at the oscars
user2: 92% on rotten tomatoes
user1: Oh, I was not aware of that.  Now I will definitely have to check it out.
user1: That is a great score.
user2: It's an interesting film. It isn't the most goundbreaking story
user2: as far as plot
user2: but the acting and the world del Toro creates are fanatstic
user1: Everything I have seen him direct has turned out to be pretty good in my opinion.
user2: yeah, Even just the films he produces
user2: like the Orphanage
user1: I forgot about that one, I really enjoyed that when it came out
user1: I did not realize that he was associated with that film.
user2: Sally Hawkins is worth looking up as well - she's british i beleive
user2: yeah he produced the orphanage
user1: I looked her up and she has a very familiar face but I can not place what I have seen her in.
user2: If anyone can make a cross species love story set in a cold war era government testing facility it's del toro
user2: Shes in a movie called Submarine that' really good
user1: Well both those movies sound good, now I have something to watch :)
user2: Anyway I hope you'll see Shape of Water, and Submarine 
user2: nice chatting.
user1: It was nice talking to you, thank you for telling me about those movies.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hey I just saw The new del Toro film, The Shape of Water!  It has a really high rating on Rotten Tomatoes!
user1: It does! And I agree, it was excellent!
user1: Cinema Score gave it an A
user1: Doe you agree with that rating?
user2: I really do!  Did you like Sally Hawkins as the mute cleaner who works for the government?
user1: I did, she was spectacular!
user1: How did you fee about Michael Shannon as Strickland?
user2: Oh Michael Shannon was great! Very compelling. I have read alot of critics on it too... they are overall pretty positive reviews.  One said it was a 'powerful vision... joyously free;
user1: The cinematography was beautiful
user2: I would expect no less from Guillermo del Toro, the director.
user1: He deserved that Oscar!
user2: I was unaware of that!  I do know that Octavia Spencer was also in the film.  She was very good as a co-worker of Elisa's character.
user1: She was good
user1: I felt her story line was a little under developed tho
user2: I could always use to see more of her!  I did love the use of sign language in the film!  It was so tenderly done.
user1: It was, I agree
user1: I love that they didn't subtitle it
user1: I did feel that Octavias
user2: Richard Spencer was astounding as the neighbor/friend too.  They dealt with his closeted nature well, I think... but I would have loved more development there.  Did they not subtitle it?  I must not have noticed that.
user1: Octavia's part was a little sterotypical though
user1: I don't remember there being subtitles, but I could be wrong?
user2: I thought the bond with the creature was developed well with her visiting him secretly, so intimate
user1: I love Richard Jenkins in everything he does
user2: Jenkins!  yes.  I always get his name wrong.  I was FREAKED at the cat scene... 
user1: I know!! I was so sad!! Poor Pandora
user1: But I love that he didn't freak out
user2: Yes, it showed his true tender heart.  The scene in the theatre downstairs was gorgeous
user1: It was a gorgeous space! And the scene was so touching
user1: The scene where she filled up her bathroom gave me anxiety lol
user2: I thought the whole sex scene would be awkward, but it was quite lovely.
user1: like, you are on a second floor apt, that is too much weight for a bathroom to handle lol
user1: OH I agree! And I love her explanation to Octavia about how lol
user2: LOL.  Did you totally sympathize with the RUssian spy guy. Mosenkov?
user1: I did eventually, I enjoyed his character arc
user2: Very much... I was even sad for him when he dies...
user1: Same!
user2: The use of the scars as gills made me gasp!  Like, I should have seen that coming!
user1: They payoff was great on Strickland's death
user1: *the
user1: Oh I agree!! Like, he made them into gills! [tears]
user2: Oh yes... I was waiting for him to die for a while!
user1: Me too! They really made you despise him
user2: Oh yes.  The voiceover worked really well to tie it together too.
user1: It did!
user1: I love how Giles assumes she had her happily ever after but for all he knew she died and was sinking to the ocean floor
user2: LOL I never thought of that, but I'm glad WE got to see the gills thing... 
user1: Me too!
user1: like he wasn't sure that the creature survived so how could he have known that he healed her down there
user2: The actors voice is so comforting, I was willing to believe him. even if I hadn't seen it.
user1: Me too
user2: I think that's it... it's been nice chatting!

user2: wow, sounds weird. is the humanoid thing at least attractive?
user1: Nope . green person with fins and a frog face 
user2: lol
user2: i wonder what makes her fall in love with him/it?
user1: The woman is a custodian at the secret government lab that they hold the creature at . 
user2: it might be worth watching i guess
user1: They become friends and she visits him in secret
user1: Yeah it might be the perfect date movie
user2: does he talk?
user1: The woman is deaf and only communcates in ASL . so I am unsure 
user1: She does steal the creature and keep him in her bathtub and thats where they first have sex 
user2: that makes it even weirder. idk this movie might be too wierd for my liking
user2: wow, they have sex??!
user1: Sorta borderlines on bestiality 
user1: The creature also has weird magically healing powers . 
user2: oh. maybe shes using him in hopes that her hearing could be restored?
user1: Like makes an old mans balding hair grow back 
user1: Creature using his healing powers to turn scars on her neck into gills so she can breathe underwater with him 
user2: if he could do that, he should be able to make her able to hear
user1: plot hole . 
user2: you gonna watch it?
user1: No . not really my thing .

user2: I did too. She did a great job
user1: overall movie came in very good shape...
user2: I saw it on tv and  I bet it looked a lot different on a huge movie screen
user1: the way she take care of the creature also very impressive
user2: After awhile I forgot she was mute. She was so caring. Reminded me of Beauty an the Beast somewhat
user1: hmm...u r right
user2: The colonel was a scary guy
user1: yeah...but his acting was good on screen
user2: The ending surprised me a little

user1: LMAO
user2: "You will have 3 turns of conversation with your partner on each of the documents."  yikes
user2: LOL right
user1: so what does that mean? 
user2: sounds like my usual type of boyfriend haha
user1: can we finish this convo and move onto the next?
user1: LOL rigght
user2: yeah I don't know, ugh
user1: this thing is so confusing I swear
user2: 4 pages of pre-instructions
user2: I know
user1: theres a button on the bottom that says finish conversation
user1: idk should I press it? I mean I think we can both agree we would watch the movie
user2: I can't see a way to move to the "next document" or whatever
user1: Any forbidden love sort of movie I like watching
user2: I guess :)  I will watch it
user2: I know, right
user1: hmmm
user2: shall we go for it lol - finish convo?
user1: yeah lets do it
user2: I'm going to live dangerously I guess. Thanks! Have a good day :)
user1: you too!

conversation:
user1: Do you like movies of fantasy and drama?
user2: Not particularly. This movie really would not catch my interest. It has a very unusual plot line. 
user1: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user2: No. There was even a critic who wrote that this movie is not ground breaking. So I dont see how it could receive such a high rating.
user2: It is the same story line as every other movie out there. A girl falls in love with an unlikely boy. This boy happens to be a weird creature and she's deaf. The deaf girl is probably the only interesting aspect to me. The rest of it is just whatever for me. Is this something you would see?
user1: I liked del Toro's work because it was elegant and creative
user1: It also had a great critical review
user2: It may have a great director but if the plot line is mundane, it wont make it as an all time classic movie
user1: Do you generally watch movies with good ratings?
user2: I would say so. Doesn't always mean I agree with the ratings. 
user2: In the first key scene, I would be drawn into the story. I like knowing her backstory that she was found in the river with wounds on her neck and now has to communicate through sign language. 
user1: I liked Sally Hawkins performance being mute
user2: Why did you enjoy her performance?
user1: I enjoyed her performance as mentally handicapped
user1: Benicio del Toro is a great director
user2: I dont think she was mentally handicapped. She just wasn't able to speak - assuming it was because of when she was little and had whatever freak accident. This movie is multifaceted with lots of different dimensions. 
user1: She has sex with a river creature in her bathroom
user2: He also eats one of her cats. That would be a deal breaker for me.
user2: I don't think that scene in the movie added to anything and probably could have gone without it.
user1: It shows how the creature can heal when he slashes Gile's arm
user2: Elisa had to go and find him and bring him back to the apartment.
user1: And then the bathroom gets completely filled with water
user2: Strickland tortures Mosenenkov for information. That would be intense.
user1: Yes but the creature slashes his throat in the end and kills him
user2: Zelda's husband is the one who told on Elisa and the creature. He was afraid though because Strickland was yelling at his wife.
user1: Stickland knew where she was through her calendar note. That was a bad move on her part to write it in her calendar.
user2: I think it is interesting that when he heals Elisa, she can start to breathe through gills. The creatures touch was able to completely change her DNA makeup and give her something she normally would have never been able to have.
user1: Through narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after" with the creature. I hope this is true.

conversation:
user1: Hi, what movie did you read about?
user2: Hello there, it's a film called The Shape Of Water
user1: What actors are starring in it?
user2: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg are the main cast
user2: It's a fantasy drama directed by Guillermo Del Toro
user2: It's also set in Baltimore in 1962, so it is a period piece
user2: Are you there?
user1: Yes sorry!
user1: What's the rating?
user2: Do you mean critically ?
user1: I mean PG, PG-13, etc.
user2: It does not say.
user2: It's about a mute custodian working at a high security government laboratory who falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature
user2: And Sally Hawkins plays Elisa, who is the mute cleaner, so she communicates through sign language
user1: What do the critics say?
user1: Or the general critic consensus? 
user2: They're raving, 92 % on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.4/10, 87 on Metacritic, an A CinemaScore
user1: Cool! Did it win any awards?
user2: Maybe you can check online but are you interested in films with creatures? It also takes place at the height of the Cold War which is a cool background
user1: Is the Cold War involved in the plot or more of just the setting?
user2: It is involved in the plot as there is a Soviet spy in the storyline, working as a scientist
user1: How much did the movie make?
user1: how much money I mean
user2: I am not sure about that but did you know that Michael Shannon plays a colonel in charge of the project to study the "asset", which is this mysterious creature that was captured from a South American river
user1: I'm not sure who Michael Shannon is. What other movies is he in? 
user2: Maybe you can check online but did you know that Elisa begins visiting the creature in secret?
user1: Are they able to communicate?
user2: They develop a close bond, and she falls in love with the creature
user1: Do they end up together in the end?
user2: Yes they do
user1: Is it pretty heavy/dramatic or lighter in general? 
user2: it's been said to have a lot of tenderness, and it is the powerful vision of a creative master feeling totally, joyously free
user1: Sounds coo, I'd be interested in seeing it. Thanks for talking today!
user2: My pleasure. 

conversation:
user2: hello!
user1: Hello!
user2: The Shape of Water recently won an Oscar, have you seen this movie?
user1: Have you read about a movie
user1: Have you read about a movie
user2: Yes, here is some info: It has an average of 8.4/10 on Rotten Tomatoes and it falls under the classification Fantasy/Drama
user1: are you there
user2: Yes, is your connection good?
user2: Can you confirm you received my messages?
user2: hello?
user2: User2 are you there?

conversation:
user1: HI WHAT MOVIE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TODAY?
user1: i love all action drama and romance movies
user2: Oh good, because the movie is The Shape of Water
user1: Interesting I never saw that movie .. have you ?
user2: I haven't seen it, but it apparently is a romance film that got great critic ratings
user1: sounds like something i would like. Whats it about ?
user2: It is a fictional movie that came out in 2017
user1: oh so it is pretty new
user2: Yes
user1: who is in it ?
user2: Baltimore 1962, a mute custodian falls in love with what sounds like a mermaid. 
user2: I don't recognize any of the cast
user1: oh mermaids are fascinating 
user1: is it a foreign film ?
user2: Oh wait sorry, the custodian is female and I think the creature is a male? 
user1: thats different 
user2: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, Michaul Stuhlbarg and Octavia Spencer.
user2: Not a foreign film
user1: Oh ok I know of Octavia Spencer but the other cast members not so much 
user2: She cleans a secret lab, finds this South American creature, sees hims secretly often when she is working
user1: oh thats a fun storyline
user1: did it win any awards the name sounds familiar
user2: She steals the creature,  and keeps him in her bathtub until she can release him to the ocean
user1: kind of like that original mermaid from the old days with Tom Hanks?
user2: The creature also apparently has healing powers, healing a cut and making a bald mans hair come back. 
user1: Oh they didnt do that in that old version 
user2: Seems more sinister than that too. The government is looking for this creature and some people die 
user2: There is also a sex scene between the mute janitor and the creature in her bathroom, so I'm guessing it might be more humanoid than a merman
user1: oh that movie is def different then the original sounds fun 
user2: So there is a big fight at the end when she's trying to release him back into the wild where the government guys shoot her in the neck, he kills the bad guys, and heals her. When he heals her, her neck scars turn into gills, happily ever after for the now two happy amphibian creatures
user1: i will see that thanks !!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: What movie are we discussing today?
user1: Hey
user1: We are going to be talking about The Shape of Water.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: I have never seen it. I have never even heard of it
user1: Well, it's pretty new. It came out in 2017.
user1: The director might be familiar to you, Guillermo del Toro?
user2: I know him
user1: I know that the movie received tons of amazing reviews. 
user1: On Rotten Tomatoes, they received a 92% average and a CinemaScore of A
user2: That is a good review. What year did the film come out?
user1: The film came out in 2017 and is set in 1962.
user2: I see. Did you like it?
user1: I actually have never seen it. It looks pretty unique, but I'll probably watch it when it comes out of the theatres.
user1: The film stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and 
user2: Thanks for that info. Is the story interesting?
user1: The story is about a mute custodian who works at a government lab and falls in love with a captured humanoid creature.
user1: That seems interesting hahah.
user2: I agree
user2: Did it get an Oscar?
user1: I do not know if it received an Oscar, I know it was nominated.
user2: I definitely want to watch it now
user1: Some of the key scenes in the film is when Elisa Esposito, the main government character finds the creature and keeps them in a bath that they need to keep adding salt to keep them alive.
user2: That seems very unique. I can imagine how cool that is
user1: Yeah incredibly unique. Also, it seems not as suitable for children as I thought.
user2: Is it rated R?
user1: There is reference to a scene when the creature eats the main characters cat..
user2: I do not like that
user1: I do not see the rating score.
user2: Well, if he eats a cat, I'm not watching it. I love cats
user1: Yeah I'm not a big fan of that, but maybe they filmed it tastefully....
user2: Hopefully
user1: Eventually, the main character is given an ultimatum, I don't want to spoil the movie however.
user1: But the creature cannot live outside of the laboratory forever which lies the problem.
user2: Thank you!

conversation:
user1: Hi, how are you?
user1: Have you seen the Shape of Water yet?
user2: A human falling in love with a humanoid amphibian creature. that's sounds intresting.
user1: Yes, it is an intriguing concept.  I've read it is Guillermo del Torro's most stunningly successful work on film.
user1: I thought it was interesting that the heroine was a mute.
user1: What did you think of Elisa's performance?
user1: What did you think of Michael Stuhlbarg in the role of Soviet spy?

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello, just got here. give me a minute

conversation:
user2: Have you seen the Shape of Water
user1: Hello! Have you seen this movie?
user1: Yes I have
user2: No 
user2: Any good?
user1: It's really good. It's a fantasy/drama film
user2: Looks like an uncoventional love story
user2: unconventional
user1: It is for sure. The cast is really great. 
user2: So what is up with the alien?
user2: She finds him in a river?
user1: He's more of a fish creature. He's found by the government and is transferred to a secret governent lab 
user1: *government 
user2: Cool then she finds him and they fall in love?
user1: She starts to visit him in his lab, and they form a really unconventional bond.
user2: Must be very unusual what with him a fish and all
user1: Yeah, but it's really sweet. She's a mute woman so they don't rely on talking, they communicate in a different way. 
user2: Talk about the "let me tell you about the big fish I caught" lol
user2: Two outcasts in love awww
user2: Were are the rest of the fish people he grew up with? Is he alone in the world?
user1: We never really find that out. Where he came from he's worshiped and referred to as a god. 
user2: Cool always good to have a handy god on hand
user2: Why is she mute? Does he fix her?
user1: We never really find that out either, it's implied something happened to her when she was a baby, and then she was orphaned.
user2: So how do the two love fish hook up? Just through a tank wall?
user1: Guillermo del Toro is a really great fantasy director, I couldn't imagine anyone else doing this sort of movie.
user1: I mean they don't show it, it's just implied that it happens. 
user1: She breaks him out and keeps him in a salt bath in her house.
user2: I see, so what we seem to have is a basic mismatched love story with a fishman/ river god that the gov wants to do stuff to.
user2: Need spies and guns next
user1: Yeah, the government wants to study him, it's in the era of the Cold War, so they want to study it to try to see if they can use it to get ahead of the Russians.
user2: Ahead in fishiness lol
user1: They want to study it for space purposes..
user2: Fish in space?

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: The movie is the Shape of Water Directed by Guillermo Del Toro
user2: Can you tell me a little bit about the movie?
user2: I've heard it's a pretty good movie.
user1: It is a fantasy drama about a mute women who forms a bond and falls in love with an amphibian creature.
user2: Oh that definitely sounds different.
user1: It has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, and Octavia Spencer.
user1: It also takes place in Baltimore in 1962.  
user2: Thank you! I was just about to ask that next!  I don't think I know any of those actors
user1: It is "one of del Toro's most stunningly successful works..."
user2: This sounds like a good movie, I've always liked stuff from that time period
user2: Wow! That's a great review
user2: Do you know if it's a long movie?
user2: And what it's rated?
user1: I'm not sure but there are several key scenes in the movie.  
user1: In one of them the main character Elisa Esposito communicates with the animal through sign language.  
user2: Interesting!
user2: And this is the animal she falls in love with?
user1: Yes the amphibian creature is the animal she falls in love with.  
user1: She also ends up having sex with the creature in her apartment bathtub.
user2: Wow! Well that's shocking and different
user2: This has piqued my curiosity it sounds like something I might have to check out!
user1: Yes quite different hah!  The creature also at some point heals her neighbor and gives the neighbor his hair back simply through touch.  
user2: Where did she meet this creature?
user1: She met the creature at her work, which is at a military lab.  

conversation:
user1: I already have a strong dislike for this movie
user2: Why do you have a strong  dislike for it?
user1: its just a rip off of a short film that came out a couple years ago
user2: Based of the document it seems to be a visually stunning movie.
user2: Do you normally like fantasy movies?
user1: yes i do but im not just going to watch a movie because its pretty
user2: What else makes you  watch a movie?
user1: i generally watch movies for an interesting story premise
user2: So you don't believe the story was interesting?
user1: no ive seen it before in that short film i mentioned
user2: I'm not familiar with that film
user1: cant remember the name off hand but the story was the same essentially
user2: I think the characters were still well potrayed
user1: i mean there is only so much you can do with such a simple premise
user1: it relies entirely on the nature of the creature to provide any kind of interest and conflict in the story
user2: I actually found the creatures role to be minimal.
user2: I think you have to explore the relationship between the other characters to find depth in the story.
user1: you say that but how itll play out is kinda predictable
user2: The relationship between the neighbors was very important. Also Octavia Butlers character seemed to be the voice of resaon.
user1: well thats to be expected as she interprets elisa to the rest of the characters
user2: No rue. Being an the the one to interpret and making a sound decision are not the samething
user2: *true
user1: what im saying is that of course that character is going to be the voice of reason as she can speak and elisa cant
user1: wheras normally the main character would be the voice of reason
user2: Sometimes you have to look at things from a different perspective.
user1: it feels hard to do that when i feel like this has all been done before
user2: There are no new ideas. You have to find the beauty in everything.
user2: This conversation has been done before, but never between the two of us.
user2: lol
user1: there are almost certainly new ideas
user1: and youre probably right about the conversation bit
user2: There are new interpretations about the same ideas
user2: Nobody will tell the same story in the same manor.
user2: The other film you saw may have played up different relationships or different characters.
user1: it did do that 
user1: however because of so much similarity
user1: i cant get behind this because it just feels like a longer version of what ive already seen

conversation:
user2: Hello, do you have a FACT sheet as well?
user2: If not the Movie IS Shape of water.
user2: Have you ever seen it?
user1: No....no fact sheet. Thanks, I was going to ask about the movie.
user1: No, I have not seen it but I have heard great things about it....have you seen it?
user2: It got an 8.4 out of ten i've never seen it either but  it is supposed to be really good

user1: Yes...sorry. I would definitely see it.
user2: Sounds good
user2: I'm not really into fanasty drama

user2: Proabsably i think it is
user2: Seems like she rerally loved him lol
user1: ....a little bit of Sci-Fi
user1: Pretty bad when humans can't find another human to love....

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hello to you!
user2: Have you seen the movie The Shape of the Water?
user1: No, not yet, but I am planning on it.  How about you?
user1: I've kinda been waiting to read the book first.  I am on the library waiting list.
user2: Yes, it's really good. Guillermo Del Toro at his finest.
user1: Yep, I have read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: Do you like the fantasy genre? 
user1: Sometimes.
user1: I think that The Shape of Water was actually classified as a 'horror' flick.
user2: Really, don't see why. Kind of thought it was fantasy/drama. 
user1: Well, according to the New York Times, as I recall, it was 'horror'.
user1: From the reviews I read, it could also be 'love story'.
user2: The cast features Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, and Michael Shannon. What do you think of the cast?
user1: It was a good cast.
user1: Who was it that played the monster?
user2: Don't know. Kinda curious myself now.
user1: Yeah, according to the reviews he did a great job. 
user1: Tough job to be all covered up like that for the part.
user2: Yep. I thought it was great the the main character Elisa Esposito was mute.
user1: Her casting was a very positive thing in light of affirmative action!
user2: The movie was set in 1962. Do you like movies set during the Cold War?
user1: Well, yes I sorta do having lived through the Cold War as a child.  Brings back memories, though not all of them are good memories - Duck and Cover and all that.
user2: Oh. Wow. My only knowledge of the Cold War is through movies and history books. What do you think of the representation of that time in movies?
user2: Such as The Shape of the Water?
user1: For the most part the representations are pretty accurate although there is not much representation of how it impacted the individuals.  For example, lots of people built underground bomb shelters and were forced to decide, based on economics, which members of their families they could accomodate.  I was evacuated to an underground bunker, during that period, on an AF base.  We didn't know if it was real or a drill.  There's very little talk about how it affected us..
user2: Wow. Thank you for your response. It must have been very difficult, I couldn't even imagine what that would be like. 
user1: I remember as a kid looking up how to protect yourself during an atomic attack.  It was recommended, among other things that you build walls of earth to block your windows to prevent penetration of radioactivity.
user1: It could be pretty intense. Sorta like a never-ending earthquake threat.
user2: I mean now there is some threat of nuclear war with North Korea, but it's not treated like something probable and we're not being reminded every minute of the day. I guess it must have been very different situation in the past.
user2: Sort of went a little off topic there. Have you heard of the end of the movie?
user1: Well, think about it, there are all those Survivalists out there now - If you're part of that movement I suspect it's pretty much the same.  To me, the difference is that it is not government supported.  I think that is the difference.  Probably though, the folks in Hawaii who got the 'mistaken' message don't feel that way.
user1: Nope, haven't heard the end of the movie.  Hopefully, it wasn't sad.
user1: Remember, all movies are based in some way on reality, so background is important.
user2: Thank you for the conversation. I won't spoil the end of the movie. Better not comment on it.
user1: Thanks, though when I read the book, supposedly, I will know the outcome.
user2: Bye
user1: Bye.  Nice chatting with you.

conversation:
user2: HELLO
user1: Hi
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: Never heard of it
user2: The Shape of Water
user1: Yes
user2: del toro is a good director though
user2: have you seen it?
user1: I have seen it. I thought it was pretty good.
user1: I like Del Toro as well
user2: cool.  Pretty good ratings
user1: I agree. the ratings are pretty accirate
user2: I see it's cold war based, those are usually iinteresting
user1: Some really good actors as well. Michael Shannon is a fantastic villain
user2: and the orphaned child is always interesting to see how things unfold
user2: Yes he is
user1: I thought it was interesting that they made the lead character mute
user2: Yeah, that's a unique angle
user1: She did so well without any spoken lines
user2: and of course the "creature" and their sexual escapade lol
user1: Do you like Fatansy movies?
user2: yes I do
user1: They did a terrific job melding the fantasy aspect with the "secret government experiments" genre
user2: That's usually tough to do, usually gets kind of cheesy
user2: I'll have to check it out.  I see she llives hapily ever after with the creature under water?  that's interesting
user1: I agree, though this movie had a bit of a fairy tale tone with the way the creature looked and the fact she keeps it in her bathtub like a kid who's hiding a pet from her mom
user2: lol yeah I bet.  Does the creature look natural/normal or is it monster like?
user1: It makes us believe she lived happily ever after. The creature was definitely monster like
user1: Like from a 50's sci fi show
user2: oh ok

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello 
user2: I will talk to you about the move “the shape of water”
user1: sure.
user1: I heard of it and saw bits on the commercials here and there but am unfamiliar about the movie.
user2:  it is fantasy drama mivie 
user2: That takes place at Baltimore in the 69s
user2: Do you know any of the cast of the movie 
user1: What is the plot of the movie?
user1: The only cast I know is Michael Shannon
user2: Yep yao are right Shannon is in the movie 
user2: Also sally hawkins
user1: Unfamiliar with Sally Hawkins
user2: The movie plot is about a love story in a secret government lab between a cleaner in the lab and humiond creature
user2: You still here 
user1: and I'm guessing that's forbidden
user1: by the scientists
user2: I think so 
user2: The cleaner is a silent orphan whi found the about creature and help it hide in her bath tub
user1: hide it in the bathtub?
user1: what else happens?
user1: hello?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!
user2: We are going to talk about the movie The Shape of Water (2017)
user2: Have you heard anything about it?
user1: That was easy.
user1: Yes! I love Del Toro and I love Doug Jones, but I am poor and haven't gotten to see it.
user2: The Shape of Water​ is a 2017 American fantasy drama film directed by Guillermo del Toro as you say and the plot is about a mute custodian at a high-security government laboratory who falls in love with a capturedhumanoid amphibian creature.
user1: Yes, I know... thanks. :)
user1: I'm kind of annoyed that Doug wasn't nominated for anything. I hear the performance was amazing.
user2: Some of the casting are the actors Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, RichardJenkins, Doug Jones, as you know, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer.  
user2: This film received good ratings: at Rotten Tomatoes: 92% and average: 8.4/10 and also at Metacritic a Score of 87/100 
user1: I do wish they had cast an actually mute actress. Disabled folk need more roles.
user1: But I suppose the representation is still good.
user2: Yes that's a good point. Do you generally watch movies with good ratings? 
user1: nah. Public opinion means very little to me. I'll consider them but they don't make my decision.
user1: Dancer in The Dark, for example, highly rated, I hated it. Hated. I hope the director eats some bad meat.
user2: I have already seen the movie and i would recommend it to you. 
user1: You don't sound like a bot at all. Very natural, lol
user2: Some more details about the plot
user2: Elisa Esposito, who as an orphaned child, was found in a river with wounds on her neck, ismute, and communicates through sign language. She lives alone in an apartment above acinema, and works as a cleaning-woman at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore atthe height of the Cold War. Her friends are her closeted next-door neighbor Giles, astruggling advertising illustrator who shares a strong bond with her, and her co-workerZelda, a woman who also serves as her interpreter at work.
user1: I wonder how much ASL the actors had to learn. Admirable. I hope to learn it myself someday.
user1: And if I say youve convinced me, are we done, I wonder?
user2: Not yet. We have to talk about some kei scenes a little bit more
user2: key
user2: If you watch the movie you should notice about the part that Elisa takes the strange creature to her apartment
user1: Ah yes. The infamous Grinding Nemo scene has to come up, I suppose
user1: I admire anyone who can communicate sensuality from under about 8 hours of creature makeup.
user1: See why Doug deserves awards?
user2: Maybe you are right about Doug deserving award, but about the movie Elisa keeps the creature in her bathtub, adding salt to the water to keep him alive and sheplans to release it into a nearby canal when it will be opened to the ocean inseveral days' time.
user2: but they fall in love and the story gets complicated
user1: I would imagine... gonna be hard for her to live in water
user2: The creature has some super abilities
user2: that can heal himself and others

conversation:
user2: Hey there do you like drama movies
user1: I do. I thought The Shape of Water was excellent.
user2: Really i have not seen it yet you like it
user1: Yes, I thought Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon gave good performances.
user2: What was the movie about
user2: I just new through the Oscars that it won one
user1: It's about a female custodian in a government lab who falls in love with a fish-like man creature that the government captured
user2: O wow know i want to watch it lol
user2: That sounds interesting 
user1: It's really beautifully made, creative and artful

user2: Yeah i bit to have one an Oscar 
user2: Nice
user2: Did they end up together at the end of the movie
user2: Did you watch this movie at the teather
user1: Yes, I watched it a the theater. It was really gorgeous to look at on the big screen. And yes, it's a fairytale style movie, so it should have a happy ending.

user1: I liked the way they showed the characters learning to understand each other and fall in love even though she can't talk and he's a fish man
user2: Interesting 
user2: Are you in the us
user1: Also, I was kind of glad they didn't actually show the sex part. I'm not sure I want to see a fish man in that way.

user1: It is a 2017 American fantasy drama film directed by Guillermo del Toro
user1: and the story follows a mute custodian at a high-security government laboratory who falls in love with a capturedhumanoid amphibian creature.
user2: hello, yes lets talk about the movie
user1: how do you feel about this movie?
user2: it seem unrealistic but it gets good reviews
user1: yes
user1: it has received some good ratings
user2: why would a spy be posing as a scientist to study an amphobian?
user2: I beleive they won awards for this movie
user1: yes it has received awards and good ratings from Rotten Tomatoes: 92% and average: 8.4/10, at Metacritic Score: 87/100 and at CinemaScore: A
user1: what do you think of these ratings?
user2: they seem very high, but I don't always agree with the ratings of mainstream
user1: ok. now we should talk about some key scenes.

user2: ok
user2: which scenes?  
user1: the main character is elisa
user1: and she is mute
user2: does the question of how she became mute get answered?
user1: I am not exactly sure but in the movie we can see she as an orphaned child, was found in a river with wounds on her neck
user2: the bathtub scene sounds interesting?
user2: I'm not sure if Stricklands interrogation includes Elisa?
user1: He tried to interrogate both elisa and her friend at his office
user1: about the creature
user2: Unsure of the staement of him dismissing them?
user1: that's right
user1: the story gets complicated
user1: as elisa tries to release the creature into the ocean
user2: Who is Moskenov?
user2: oh I see it's the spy.
user2: intersting that she can now breathe under water, how did the gills grow so quick?
user1: Dimitri Mosenkov, a Soviet spy working as a scientist studying thecreature, under the alias "Dr. Robert Hoffstetler".
user2: I see that now, thank you
user1: ok
user1: yes at the end they ecape together
user2: I hope htey did live ever after sounds like a sweet story that I no longer need to see

user2: It’s about a girl and a water monster
user2: A love story really
user1: Did you like it?
user2: I liked it, but I was like Meh in the end
user1: who is in it?
user2: I don’t know where it gets all the hype from.
user2: Octavia Spencer and Sally Hawkins
user2: Do you know either one?
user1: Oh yeah. I know Octavia Spencer
user1: Didn't it win the oscar for best picture?

user1: what else is Sally Hawkins in?
user1: DO you know?
user2: Not really, this is the first film I saw Sally Hopkins in
user2: Do you know her from anywhere else?
user1: Oh Hopkins. No, I don't know her
user1: I think I might wait until it comes to Netflix
user1: did you have any favorite parts?
user2: I don’t think it’ll be coming to netflix
user2: Every scene is beautiful I’d say, but the story doesn’t really hold up.
user1: It looked a little odd
user2: It was definetely odd
user2: Still, I’d recommend though
user1: Guillermo del Toro is a good actor
user1: i mean director
user2: Haha

conversation:
user2: yeH
user2: Hey
user2: Not yeh, hihi, my keyboard has funny actions when I type in here like the alphabet are reversed
user2: anyhow, have you seen this movie before?
user1: Yes, I just saw Shape of Water. 
user1: I loved it. What did you think?
user2: It sounds pretty interesting, government experiment, humanoid amphibian creature, love... I have not seen this movie yet but introduction kinds of getting me to want to watch it, plus you loved it so probably a good movie overall
user2: it has really good rating overall from critics and rotten tomatoes too wowo
user2: did you see it in theater?
user1: Yeah, I have to agree with the good ratings on this one. 
user1: I did! It was a good one to see on the big screen.
user1: Sally Hawkins is especially good in it. 
user2: so she plays the mute cleaner in the government secret lab, how fitting to have someone mute works in a secret lab, the plot thickens hihi. What makes this movie so good?
user1: It has drama and romance and it is elegant and stunning. 
user2: haha, why do I feel like I am talking to a girl
user2: Is it steamy too?

conversation:
user2: Hi  I can't find the discussion pages.
user1: Hi, I think I am the only one who can seen the pages
user1: Have you seen The Shape of Water?
user2: okay but the other time we both saw them
user1: This is my first time
user1: This document I have is about the movie The Shape of Water
user1: Do you like Guillermo Del Toro movies?
user1: Are you still there?
user1: hello?

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you
user2: Hello
user2: I'm good, how are you
user1: Doing very well, thank you.  Shall we start?
user2: Sure!
user2: So what's the movie's name
user1: The title of this movie is 'The Shape of Water'. Have you heard of it?
user2: I have heard of it. When did it come out?
user1: It came out quite recently, in 2017. Assuming you have not seen it? Or have you?
user2: No I have not seen it
user2: That is very recent. How are the ratings for the movie?
user1: Well, I think you should! According to many critics, and specialized movie websites, it received very high ratings.
user2: I see I see. 
user2: Who is a part of the cast?
user1: In fact, Rotten Tomatoes gave this a 92%! The main cast is made up of Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, and Michael Stuhlbarg
user2: Ah i see! What genre is the film?
user1: It's in the Fantasy-Drama genre, something director Guillermo del Toro is known for
user2: Ah Guillermo del Toro is a good director
user2: What happens in the movie?
user1: The movie's about an orphaned child who was found in a river. As the movie progresses, some mysterious creatures appear, and the orphan child decides to befriend them
user2: That's very interesting
user2: Is the creature dangerous?
user1: Hm, I think that may give a bit too much away!
user1: Think Chernobyl 
user2: Are there any other characters?
user2: There's a radiation involved?
user1: More-so the Soviet Government aspect of the situation
user2: Ah I see
user2: What time period is this movie? Cold War?
user1: There were other characters, but the main cast is where the majority of the roles are distributed, naturally.
user2: Alright
user1: This does occur during the Cold War
user1: in the 1960's
user2: So cold war tensions will be a theme
user2: That was very interesting. Thanks for telling me about the movie

conversation:
user1: Hey, what did you think of the Oscars best picture?
user2: It was awesome. Michael Shannon did an amazing job!
user1: I agree, overall I think most of the acting jobs were great! 
user2: I agree. And the critics are right. It is one of "Toro's most stunningly successful works."
user2: I like how it was set in Baltimore in 1962. I wasn't expecting that from the trailer. 
user1: Yeah, I didn't think Duillermo del Toro could surpass Pacific Rim but he did a phenomenal job here. 
user1: Yeah me either, although it did look a bit dated on the trailer, I was expecting it would take place in the 1920s or something. 
user2: I liked how Sally Hawkins' character has a handicap.
user1: Yeah, it made him more personable and charming as a character.
user2: I agree. The romance was great, too
user1: made her I meant, typo
user2: What did you think about the humanoid amphibian?
user1: I thought it was creepy at first but then I was mesmerized\ by it, like Sally. 
user2: She probably connected with him because she was an orphan child. 
user1: Yeah and he was a bit of an escape from her somewhat mediocre life. 
user1: meaning she had a lot of problems in her day to day life
user2: Very true. Though, living above a cinema would be nice. 
user1: That's true. Although the noise might get annoying in time.
user1: Rent would definitely be cheap!
user2: Especially when you're trying to keep a creature in your bathub! 
user2: edit: bathtub 
user1: Yeah, I can't believe she was daring enough to take him to her place!
user2: I thought that was a very suspenseful part. Did you think they would be discovered?
user1: I really did and the film would've suffered for it.
user2: It reminded me of E.T. a little bit when the creature got sick. Well ... except for the romance part.
user1: Yeah, true. The sickness makes the aliens way more engendering and you just want to do anything possible to help them. 
user2: I agree. It made me sad. It was also sad about the handlers who got shot. 
user1: Yeah, that was unfortunate.
user1: That farewell they tried to have prior to all the action was quite sad too.
user2: Especially, how they tortured Mosenkov.
user2: I agree.
user1: Yeah, he didn't deserve that harsh treatment.
user2: At least there was a "happily ever after" ending.
user1: Yeah and the movie deserved all that critical acclaim, it was fantastic.
user2: Yes. Del Toro should be able to make whatever movie he wants now.
user1: Definitely, he's one of the few star directors that I can name. He'll probably do an indie movie soon.
user1: Thanks for the chat! have a good day
user2: You too!

conversation:
user1: suh dude
user2: Hello! Goodmorning
user1: hiii :)
user2: So what movie are we talking about?
user1: Shape of water
user2: Ah! nice
user2: What is it about?
user1: Well it's a love story it takes place in baltimore
user1: You haven't seen it?
user2: Well, I think I watched like the first 20 minutes of it, but I had to go to work. So I didn't finish it.
user2: I just know the main character was deaf/
user1: she's not deaf she's mute haha
user2: lol... oops well see!
user2: I don't remember to well.
user1: She's very pretty
user2: Oh whats the actors name?
user1: Sally Hawkins i believe
user2: So tell me more? What makes this movie worth watching>
user1: Well the special effects are great.
user1: The villain is superb...he's easy to hate
user2: Yes, I know the guy is from boardwalk empire, I don't remember his name.
user1: Michael Shannon
user2: Yea, he gives me a creeper vibe.
user1: he's great..he's kind of like the character from Boardwalk...but more evil :D
user2: Oh no! he was already pyscho in there. So hes the villain? What does the mute girl do?
user1: Well she falls in love...with some creature...it's really hard to explain
user2: So... a forbidden romance?
user2: With a creature... lol Oh my.
user1: yea it's a strange movie but it's worth watching
user2: Okay, will check it out.

conversation:
user2: ?eivom eht fo snoisserpmi tsrif ruoy era thaw iH
user2: Hi what are your first impressions of the movie?
user1: Hello! What movie would that be?
user2: The Shape of Water, It gets high ratings from every source
user1: That's an interesting name. Is it a science-based movie?
user2: Fantasy drama with some science fiction more than science
user2: Good cast , although not big names
user1: Science fiction works perfectly too! It makes most movies better
user1: Really? It's nice to see movies give newer or less known actors a shot.
user2: It certainly can make them more entertaining
user2: Director is pretty famous , although I am not very familiar with his work
user1: What's the director's name?
user2: Guillermo del Toro
user1: Oh, wow. Yeah, he's a pretty good director. I thought he only made horror/thriller movies
user2: The story revolves around a mute cleaning woman at a government facility in Baltimore
user1: That doesn't sound like a good thing for that woman.
user1: It sounds like she's going to witness something she shouldn't have
user2: She falls in love with an amphibian humanoid creature being held there
user1: Well, that doesn't sound nearly as bad as I was expecting
user2: She rescues the creature from the facility and keeps him in her bath tub
user1: That sounds like a bad move. Does the facility trace it back to her?
user2: Eventually. Her neighbor helps her conceal him and they discover that the creature has healing abilities
user2: It sounds like a pretty bad movie to earn best picture
user1: It definitely sounds like a B-rated movie, but you can't judge a book by its cover
user1: G del Toro does a pretty good job of adding emotions and unexpected twists in his movie
user2: They take the creature to the canal to release it when the officials start looking for it
user1: The way you phrased that makes it sound like they don't succeed in the attempt.
user2: She and the creature get shot but the creature heals itself and dives into the canal with her .  It heals her and gives her gills so they can live together underwater.
user1: On one hand I enjoy that happy ending, on another I'm fairly disappointed they lived. 
user2: I'm not sure what I think of the ending 
user2: Not sure I would recommend the movie but it is probably good enough to watch
user1: There's a moderate chance that ending is just the dying fantasy of the creature and woman. He likes to leave hints for the viewers to go through if they want
user1: Yeah, it would be nice to watch on a day where you're just relaxing 
user2: Thanks for your views. Have a good day
user1: Anytime! You too

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey hows it going? This movie looks pretty interesting don't you think?
user2: Have u seen the movie yet?
user2: Yes very much
user1: I have not. But I do like Guillermo del Toro's work as a director
user1: Have you?
user2: I like that the movie is sci fi
user2: I have seen only this 
user1: And the 92% on rotten tomatoes is actually pretty assuring. It's got good reviews all around
user2: And I am sure other might be good like this 
user2: Yes I see reviews from this site a lot 
user2: I am pretty sure it deserved what it’s overall review
user1: The plot does seem a bit strange. A mute custodian falling in love with a amphibian-type creature? I don't think that's ever been done before. 
user2: Agree 
user2: A new type of movie all together 
user1: Agree. I think it takes a great storyteller like Del Toro to be able to tell such an uncommon narrative. 
user2: Yes only a good story can make fantastic movie like this 
user2: But it takes lots of effort from other team as well
user2: The actors did pretty good too
user1: Of course, and speaking of which, are you familiar with any of the cast outside of this movie?
user2: No
user2: I am not much familiar of their work but now I would see some of their movie or serial for sure
user1: Same here, I think the only one I'm familiar with is Michael Shannon. I actually kinda like when movies have actors I haven't seen very often, like this one. It sort of makes the experience more immersive. 
user2: Thanks for recommendations 
user1: No problem.
user2: I will surely look 
user1: anyway I think it's kind of cool that elisa is a mute, it really makes for an interesting movie because it emphasizes story beyond all else. 
user2: Yes
user1: I don't like that Pandora, the cat gets eaten though. I hate that :(
user2: Haha 
user2: Unfortunately but we all learn from this great movie 
user2: Thanks for review 
user2: Bye 
user1: Of course. Lessons here. 
user1: I also enjoyed though how the creature could heal itself. That was great. 
user2: Bye nice meeting you
user1: anyway I think we both agree this is a very powerful movie. 
user1: Yes, nice to meet you as well. 
user1: Thank you for the time. 
user2: Bye 

conversation:
user2: sup
user1: Hi
user2: so whats the movie about
user1: I just saw a great new movie called The Shape of Water. You'll love it, it has 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: It's about a mute woman who works in a lab and falls in love with... a creature!
user2: i prefer imdb ratings fam. the da bomb diggity
user1: I don't know the IMDB rating, but the CinemaScore was an A.
user2: well hot dog
user2: that sounds so lovely
user2: I would like to see that film
user1: It was directed by Guillermo del Toro, I think it's one of his best.
user2: the fish guy reminds me of the fish guy in hellboy
user2: never googled to see if there was a link
user1: Yeah, he is like the guy in Hellboy somewhat. It's a humanoid amphibian. The mute woman starts visiting him in secret in the lab.
user1: She's played by Sally Hawkins, who is fantastic.
user2: still wonder if its some sort of nod
user2: how long do we have to talk lol
user1: 15 exchanges.
user2: well yes
user2: movie sounds lovely
user2: who plays fish guy?
user1: Eventually, the woman helps the creature escape. She hides him in her bathtub.
user2: thats hot
user1: I don't know who the fish guy is, but Michael Shannon and Olivia Spencer are also in the movie.
user2: oh neato burrito
user1: The creature has powers. He solves her  next door neighbor's baldness.
user2: lucky! it runs in my family haha
user1: Eventually the husband of one of the mute woman's coworkers rats her out for hiding the creature.
user2: oh cool
user2: i should watch it for sure
user1: I won't tell you how it ends, but the creature does have to heal someone else.
user2: oh seeeettt
user1: He actually has to heal himself too.
user2: oh wow thats a lot of healing
user1: Yep. Fun talk. I hope you like it. 

conversation:
user1: hey
user2: The Shape of Water have you seen it?
user1: No, I haven't
user2: It is a fantasy drama that came out in 2017.
user1: who is in it?
user2: Basically, It is about a mute woman "Sally Hawkins" 
user2: Who is a cleaner for a secret government laboratory. 
user1: I'm interested
user1: who plays sally?
user2: Sally plays as Elisa Esposito.
user1: did you like the movie?
user2: She has 'wounds' on her neck and is found by a river when she was a baby
user2: I did enjoy it, it was a bit strange though.
user1: Is it one you would recommend?
user2: Yes, it was very interesting it ever got like a 8/10 score.
user1: would it be a good movie for a date?
user2: If you like fantasy and drama this movie is for you.
user1: I have never been a big fan of fantasy
user2: Well... If your date is into mysterious creatures and forbidden love
user2: Well there is a human-like creature in it.
user1: mysterious creatures?
user1: if you tell me too much will it spoil the movie for me?
user2: Yes, hes like some type of creature who lives in the water, which needs salt.
user2: Sorta, if you watch the trailer it pretty much shows everything
user1: Wow and we are all supposed to cut back on salt
user2: haha. Not him he needs it to survive 
user1: would you see it again?
user2: No, It is one of those strange movies you like, but it's not worth watching multiple times 
user1: yeah I've seen some like that
user2: Also... The creature has like power to help regenerate 
user1: now that's wierd
user1: so if I watch the trailer that ruins it for me?
user2: No, but if you want I can tell you how it ends.
user1: No thanks:)
user2: Or you could watch it! It honestly is one worth watching.
user1: alright, I might rent it this weekend
user2: Thanks for talking to me about the movie, have a nice day :)
user1: you have a great day too!

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello, I just saw "The Shape of Water".
user2: really? was it good?
user1: It totally deserved the great reviews it got.
user1: All the usually ratings places gave it good reviews, CinemaScore gave it an A.
user2: i think cinema score is just how much it made
user2: but i definatly want to see it
user1: Well, Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92%.
user2: am i the second person you've chatted with?
user2: wow
user1: The director is Guillermo del Toro.
user2: they're usually pretty harsh
user2: that's a familiar name but i can't put him together with anything 
user1: It came out last year, and it is a fantasy drama.
user1: Well, one reviewer says this is one of his "most stunningly successful works" so it seems has must have done a few others.
user2: you saw it in a theater? 
user1: Another states that this movie has tenderness uncommon to his films, so  clearly has has worked on a fair number.
user1: It came out last year but there are ways to see it now.
user2: ah, good
user2: it said del torro erroneously credited with directing
user2: on this document it says he directed it
user1: I saw that actor Benicio del Toro had been credited as a director. Guillermeo del Toro was the director.
user2: oh! two different people, i get it
user1: There was one scene where the creature is out of the lab being kept in a bathtub.
user2: i just watched the preview on youtube, i saw that
user1: There was also a kitty being the lunch of the creature, so if you are squeamish about that sort of thing it might put you off.
user2: heh, no that sounds like my kinda thing
user1: This is probably a spoiler, but there is sort of a happily ever after ending.
user2: he and the water creature live happily ever after?
user1: There is an implied happy ending from a voiceover narration at the end.
user2: ah, so this wasn't a book?
user1: Well, it was a film.
user2: i'm sayin it's not a book adapted to screenplay
user1: It was written by Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor, but no mention I saw was about a book, i think the writing refers to the screen play.
user2: was this in 3d?
user1: I didn't see it that way, but I don't know if it was also able to be seen in 3D.
user2: i like movies better in 3d. you?
user1: I thought it was interesting that one of the main characters was mute. I wondered before I saw it how that was going to play out, a creature who presumably doesn't speak, and a person who can't speak.
user2: that does sound interesting. apparently they made it work?
user1: Sure, everybody must have thought so, since it got good reviews.
user2: what will they thin of next
user2: it's really somthin 
user1: Well, there was a romance sceene.
user1: In a bathtub.
user2: romance with an alien
user2: haha that aint right
user1: Apparently the reviews were okay with that.
user2: they need jesus

user2: I'm not sure about how long this movie is-the trailer btw is on youtube and it's awesome
user2: I know:-) my husband already said he is not watching this:-)
user2: He thinks its creepy:-) but I think it's a strangely beautiful story
user1: Hmmm, Yeah I'm probably not going to be watching this either, maybe reccomend it to my sister
user1: She's 13 is that appropriate?
user2: although the creature is not romance-enduing-very ugly looking thing in fact!

conversation:
user2: Hi there. how are you today?
user1: I am doing great.  I hope you are, too!

user2: I do know the scritical response was positive.
user2: critical, sorru
user2: sorry, lol typing badly

user1: Sally Struthers is in this movie?  I did not realize that.  I haven't seen her acting in awhile. 
user2: Micheal shannon, richard jenkins
user2: I only know her from this, she is very good.
user1: I really love Octavia Spencer.  
user2: ph wait
user2: sally hawkins not struthers.
user2: Ya octavia spencer is always fun to watch on screen,
user1: Okay!  That is funny.  Sally Struthers played Gloria on All in the Family.  She would be pretty old now. 
user2: She plays her friend at work, zelda.
user2: lol
user2: I CONFUSED THE TWO NAMES.
user1: I had seen Octavia Spencer on the preview but it did not seem like a huge role.  Do you know if she gets a lot of screen time?
user2: She gets a decent amount.
user2: I would says a main character for sure.
user1: I will have to see it.  
user1: Do you know when the movie was released?

user2: I think so.
user1: Is the movie still out at the theaters or is it available to stream?
user2: I don't have access to that information here.
user2: Sorry.
user1: That is okay. 
user2: I am sure you can look it up online easily.

user1: I will make it a point to watch it.  
user2: lol cool.
user2: Hope you enjoy it.
user2: Have a nice rest of your day.
user1: You, too. 

conversation:
user1: shape of water has Sally Hawkins and Michael shannon in it
user1: it is a fantasy drama 
user2: It might be interesting, sort of an spaceman/ human love affair thing
user1: the critics gave it pretty decent reviews
user2: Critics usually have a lot to say, much is not too interesting to me
user2: I wonder at why the alien wants to have a human female?
user1: the setting is 1962 i did not know the custodian  is mute
user2: her being a mute actually helps the plot
user2: Have you seen this film?
user1: i have not see it yet. have you?
user2: Nope
user2: Might be good, hard to tell
user1: i think i will enjoy it . will know more about it when they filp the page
user2: Foreign films are sometimes better than Hollywood films
user2: Dont have a lot more to add
user2: Her childhood sucked with her having her neck shot or cut or something
user1: so the cleaning lady finds the creature the government is hiding and they fall inlove.
user2: Ya
user1: yea she was found in a river with cuts in her neck. i am guessing that is why she cannnot speak
user2: Thats right
user1: i thought it was an alien but now it looks like some creature found in the waters?
user2: Made her sort of an outcast in common society so her falling in love with another outcast is natural
user2: I guess she found the critter herself? And was hiding it from the gov for a bit?
user1: and the creature can heal with touch.
user1: looks like the plan is to release it back to the ocean
user2: Of course there has to be some superpower angle
user2: what good is an alien that doesnt do anything fantastic? lol
user1: and the ofcource the relationship turns romantic
user2: turns herinto a fishwoman lol
user1: ah casue they are attacked durrign the escape
user2: got to have violence in these things too to balance the romance eh?
user1: i guess so. it might be boring if it was easy for them to live a peaceful life.
user1: i guess that would not make a good story .\
user2: It strikes me as having very foreign influences 
user2: Falls a bit short
user1: i still think i want to see it. i think the special effects will be beautiful. 
user1: have a great day
user2: but makes perfect simple sense to the unsophisticated audience

conversation:
user1: This looks like a great movie; I'd really like to see it.
user2: I agree! I think that its a weird love story that would actually make me feel a little connected
user1: Same, haha. I'm not usually into that kinda stuff, but I think the outside influences around all of it kinda get me more interested than a typical love story would
user2: I think that both of the people are handicapped in a way and thats probably why it works really well because they can understand how each other is feeling
user2: Oh yeah definitely
user2: Its kind of like a drama too so you don't have to be so into the love story haha
user1: That's an interesting point. I hadn't really thought about the whole handicapped in a way thing
user1: The government intrigue is what really hooked me, I think
user2: Yeah and the whole Russia soviet spy thing is really interesting
user1: I wonder if they went that direction because of current political turmoil
user2: Hmmm good thought, I mean I'm super interested because of that 
user1: Its interesting that elsa's best friends are also in some way kinda held back by personal things

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello have you seen the shape of water?
user2: No, have you?
user1: Yes, it's a fantasy/drama film, it's really good
user2: Yeah? Who directed it again?
user1: Guillermo Del Toro
user2: Do you like him as a director?
user1: Yes I do like him. But this is meant for the shape of water. 
user2: Yes, I know. Who stars in it?

conversation:
user1: hello :)
user2: Really? What is the main plot if the movie?
user1: In the shape Of Water ?
user2: I absolutely do. It is probably one of the best animated movies of all time
user1: Animated ?
user2: The shape of water I dont agree with those ratings
user1: You think those are too high ?
user2: Yes animated
user2: And yes I think the shape of water ratings are too high. Very odd and flimsy story line
user1: I wouldn't call The Shape Of Water an animated movie... there are decent CGIs but that's different. Movie was very artistic and I think it deserves the highest ratings. Plus it won an Oscar !

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hi, what movie is it ? I'm so excited!
user1: Hello. The name of the movie is The Shape of Water.
user2: OH cool, what's it about?
user1: Fantasy and drama film.
user2: yeah, who stars in it?
user1: Give me a second,please.
user1: Yes it starts with Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito.
user2: who else?
user1: She is a mute cleaner for a specter government laboratory.
user2: Government Laboratory! That sounds interesting. What kind of research do they do there?
user1: Yes. It does. Also Michael Shanon as Colonel Richard Strickland as a corrupt military official that is in charge of project study " asset".
user1: Set is in Baltimore in 1962.
user1: But wait there is more to the story.
user2: a period drama, neat!
user1: A mute cascading falls in love with captured humanoid amphibian creature.
user2: what?! Is that the subject of study in the laboratory?
user1: My screen froze for a minute, I apologize. Can you see my replies?
user2: i can
user2: it the amphibian creature the source of study in the laboratory?
user1: OK. Thank you. The subject is a captured humanoid amfphibian creature.
user2: do you know how they fall in love?
user1: Yes
user2: Is it kind of beautiful or just weird?
user1: Yes. A girl name Elisa found out about that creature brought from South America and desired to come around and keep it some company.
user1: After of several visits she falls in love with it.
user2: how did they communicate?
user1: Yes. Very weird circumstances.
user2: after they fell in love was the creature able to leave with the mute woman?
user1: Well that a good one.
user1: Because a girl was an orphaned child, a mute  who communicates through the sign language.
user2: This is odd, does the creature know American sign language as well?
user1: Well unfortunately, for that you will have towatch a movie for yourself.
user2: what?
user1: Yes. It is.

conversation:
user2: hey
user2: have you seen the shape of water?
user1: No i have not
user2: It came out in 2017
user1: The reviews are very good for this movie
user2: The genre of the movie is a fantasy type drama. 
user2: yes they were really good reviews.
user1: The Director was Guillermo del Toro
user2: It got a 92% on rotten tomatoes and average of 8.4. 
user1: Cinema Score was A
user2: Yeah  Guillermo del Toro did a great job.
user1: Sally Hawkins played Elisa
user2: Metacritic scored it 87 out of 100 and Cinema score gave it an A
user1: Elisa was an orphan child
user2: Yeah she was found in a rive with wound on her body, and she was mute so she had to communicate through sign language.
user1: Elisa lves alone
user1: lives
user2: She was a bit of a loner and lived on top of a theatre 
user1: She kept a creature in her bathtub
user2: yeah she comes in contact with this fish like creature because she was an employee for a secret government lab in Baltimore during the cold war.
user1: Elisa and a creature became involved with one another
user2: yeah she apparently had a think for fish
user1: Lol they even had sx
user1: sex
user2: yeah
user2: things escalated real quick
user1: The creature was to be recovered
user2: so pretty much this love slash fantasy drama starts to unravel because elisa falls for the fish man
user1: The creatures heath started deteroating
user2: yeah it kind has a beauty and the beast premise in a sense
user1: The creature was shot 
user2: ohh and i forgot to mention the fish dude has supernatural healing abilities. 

conversation:
user1: Wow, Shape of Water really is a deserving winner of best movie of the year! What do you think?
user2: Yeah, it's a really interesting premise.
user2: What do you think about the love story?
user1: Did you ever expect movie about a woman falling in love with a male mermaid would win best picture? I liked the love story.
user2: It's really surprising. What do you think about the portrayal of disability?
user1: To be honest I never even considered the aspect of disability.
user1: What did you think of the portrayal?
user2: It's easy for us to overlook if it doesn't affect us.  I think the representation in cinema is important. 
user1: That's true. There isn't very good representation in modern cinema
user2: Do you usually like fantasy movies like this?

conversation:
user2: Hello there, the movie document provided is about the new film out 'The Shape of Water' by Del Toro. Have you heard about this movie before?
user1: I think I have heard about it. Didn't it get a bunch of awards?
user2: Yeah it did, it's got really high ratings on many platforms too, even though the movie has some unconventional themes like inter-species relationships. I didn't expect a positive reception
user1: Huh inter-species relationships sounds interesting I guess it proves love has no bounds. Could you give me a bit more about the story line without giving away the whole thing? I really don't like when I'm told the whole movie before I see it.
user2: I get the same way, I'm even avoiding most trailers these days. The story is of a mute woman working as a janitor in a secret government lab. The movie is through and through a love story, if you enjoy those kinda movies you'll probably like this movie. The director is great at his craft.
user1: Sounds interesting and like something I will have to check out. I love love lol of course getting the hubby to watch probably won't happen. Thanks for the info :)
user2: Wouldn't watch it with any children around though, just a warning :). I've seen the film and I quite enjoyed my time with it, hard movie for me recommend  to friends though with it being a romance and me being a guy :P
user1: Well that just gave me leverage to get my hubby to watch. Proof his man card won't be ripped away lol
user2: Made by the same guy who made Hellboy, Pans labyrinth and pacific rim, not really love movies so it was pretty shocking to see him handle this kinda movie so well. I'm a big movie lover so I usually know all these useless facts about them 
user1: I'm the same way with music I can tell you all about a song and the lyrics stick with me forever but don't ask me who sings it or the title lol. Isn't there another movie or 2 you want to talk about?
user2: Yeah but I'm not entirely sure about how all this works. 
user1: The instructions said 3 movies and after three responses on to the next for a total of 15 responses which is what we needed for a minimum.
user1: sorry 5 responses
user2: I've got the document at the side, just the shape of water that's here. Tasks to tell you about the movie and convince you to watch or not watch it, we achieved that quite quickly. Says I will get the next movie automatically after "3 turns"
user1: well then guess they have something broke or this is really what they want to see how we react to something not working lol
user2: You never know lol. 
user1: Mine just says to make sure I get the title and info on the movie to make a decision at the feedback page.
user1: Your right I have done some studies where they say at the end thanks and we were really looking for xyz not abc  :)
user1: Is your finish conversation button clickable? Maybe you have to click it to go to the next one
user2: Ah yeah mine is grayed out.
user2: A new part just loaded into the document. Descriptions of scenes and stuff, wont talk about em though to now spoil the movie for you :P
user2: It changes the more we talk I think, still shape of water though
user1: hehe well you can give it a read maybe there's some more info that would be interesting to me and not spoil it :)
user2: Well she works cleaning up at the secret government place with her best friend. The story kicks off when a new subject is brought in.
user2: You can imagine what it is :D
user1: I bet an alien and man or at least in looks lol
user2: She starts taking time away from her work and her friend to spend time with it
user1: But of course that's how it goes and the more time they spend together the more she likes him and one thing leads to another.......
user2: ...and romance :D Yeah.
user2: The main character is totally mute though the movie, so there's a little bit of subtitles. Not too much though, the main character is quite funny in the movie working with her friend
user1: lol the different species and the government office sounds like something to help give it a new spin though. Of course I'm a big fan of the X-Files so I say its a government conspiracy and aliens are among us now lol. Ya, not being able to talk makes the whole communication thing a bit trickier I imagine then again it made it easy for the actress to learn here lines.
user2: Alotta sign language, her friend does some translating but they are a funny pair. Like if the mute girl swears off at someone in her sign language the other would just say "She said have a nice day".
user2: There's a little comedy in the movie, makes it more lightharted :)
user1: lol that sounds like a good match
user2: Finish convo is available now, looks like
user1: cool beans I'm ready if you are :) Thanks for the chat and have a great week
user2: you too

conversation:
user1: I really enjoyed the character arc of Colonel Richard Strickland
user2: Me too. Michael Shannon is a great actor.
user1: I also like how the "Monster"  showed exactly zero mercy to him at the end 
user2: I wouldn't refer to him as a 'monster'; rather, a captured humanoid amphibian creature.
user1: I wasn't sure it was the kind of movie that wins "best picture" when I watched it initially, I'm still not really sure how I feel about the movie as a whole
user1: Someone I know called it "The most wonderfully directed, beautiful-looking 'who cares' of all time"
user2: i think it was one of del Toro's most stunningly successful works
user1: To be fair I'm pretty sure I have not seen most of his other work
user1: the musical scene was pretty awesome
user2: we
user1: the movie was about to lose me but that won me right back
user2: well the shape of water has a tenderness to it uncommon to del toro films
user2: I thought it was interesting how Elisa communicates using sign language
user1: Oh I liked the symbolism of elisa bringing the aquatic creature egs
user1: *eggs
user1: kinda foreshadowing the eventual sharing of bodies
user2: yes, they form a close bond
user2: she also has a strong bond with Giles
user2: And also a strong bond with Zelda, her co-worker.
user1: Yeah they are all good friends
user1: I felt bad for the cat that got eaten
user2: I'm not sure about that
user2: Oh, I remember, the creature devours one of Giles' cats
user2: It slashes his arm and then runs away

conversation:
user2: What is the movie?
user1: The shape of water
user2: What is the Shape of Water about?
user1: Elisa is a mute, isolated woman who works as a cleaning lady in a hidden, high-security government laboratory in 1962 Baltimore. Her life changes forever when she discovers the lab's classified secret -- a mysterious, scaled creature from South America that lives in a water tank. As Elisa develops a unique bond with her new friend, she soon learns that its fate and very survival lies in the hands of a hostile government agent and a marine biologist.
user1: It's a love story.
user1: and a metaphor for something looked down upon,
user2: Looks like an interesting movie, what actors plays in the movie?
user1: 	Sally HawkinsMichael ShannonRichard JenkinsDoug JonesMichael StuhlbargOctavia Spencer..
user2: How does the movie end?
user1: At the canal, Elisa and Giles bid farewell to the creature, but Strickland arrives and attacks them all. Strickland knocks Giles down and shoots the creature and Elisa, who both appear to die. However, the creature heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the creature takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where, deep under water, he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, they open to reveal gills like his. In a closing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after" with the creature.
user1: That's a surprising question
user1: I never ask that about films I haven't seen,
user2: I like the movie dynamics and characters and the plot. Plus it won't spoil the movie for me so don't worry. Who directed the movie?
user1: Oh, and what a director he was, Guillermo del Toro. Love him.
user2: Me too. What was the movie made?
user1: What or when?
user1: Sorry, that phrasing is odd,
user2: Sorry When was the movie made. Typo on my part.
user1: Either way, it was released in 2017.
user2: Who was your favorite character in the movie? 
user1: Colonel Richard Strickland, Michael Shannon. I always find he completely absorbs the screen when he works.
user1: Earlier when I was it was a love story I mean;t it was more of a dream of love.
user2: How did the movie make you feel at the end. Where you crying, what were you feeling?  I am going to watch this movie tomorrow It seems rather enjoyable.
user2: A dream of love could be considered a love story.
user1: Personally, it didn't make me cry, it takes a lot.  It's a must-see, easily one of the most uncommon and unique films I've ever seen, I was entranced and accepted her decision. it felt appropriate
user1: But it does have fantasy elements. Like  "her"
user1: Just my opinion.

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: Hello
user1: How r u?
user2: I'm great, how are you?
user1: Fine, thanks.
user1: Did you like movie?
user2: Yes, I am a huge fan of it
user1: I thought it was pretty good
user1: What did you like about it?
user2: I really liked the depth of the actors and the intricacies of the plot. What di you like about it?
user1: Thought the acting was done well, especially Richard Jenkins.
user1: Movie reminded me of Splash, which I also liked.
user2: That's also a great film. The genre of this movie is also one of my favorites.
user1: Did you have a favorite scene?
user2: My favorite scene was when the creature was revealed.
user2: What was yours?
user1: I liked the sequence where the bathroom got flooded. Thought that was pretty creative.
user2: I agree, I think the whole movie was very creative. I think it requires a lot of thought and imagination to think of a plot like this.
user1: Yes, I agree.
user1: What other movies of this genre did you like?
user2: I like other Benecio Del Toro dramas. He's a great actor, don'
user2: **don't you think?
user2: Sorry, Guillermo del Toro
user1: I dont know too many other movies that he did besides Pan's Labyrinth
user1: That one was pretty weird as well.
user2: Most of his movies are really weird. He's always rated pretty well too. His ratings for this movie were really high.
user2: Speaking of weird, what did you think of the scene where the creature heals the character in the canal?
user1: Yeah I thought that was weird as well.
user1: Like can he heal or what? He somehow also gave her gills.
user1: I just found out that he also did Hellboy
user1: So yeah he does all weird movies.
user2: He must have a really fertile mind to be able to think of all these bizarre fantasy movies.... Healing a person and giving them gills... crazy stuff
user1: Yeah definitely
user1: He directed it.. did he write this movie as well?
user2: Yes, it was written by del toro and Vanessa Taylor.
user1: Thats cool

conversation:
user1: Do you like romance movies like this?
user2: Did it bother you that the movie featured a love story with a non-human being?
user1: It did not bother me and I thought it was a unique look at romance. 
user2: Sure. I have no problem with romance films, though normally not what I look for in a film. 
user2: Same for me. I was curious about it and was completely intrigued.
user1: I also am not usually a fan of movies that revolve around romance but I really liked the 'sci-fi' aspect of it, and am a fan of Guillermo del Toro
user2: I really liked the supporting cast, too.
user2: I don't have much experience with del Toro, but I'll be looking for his works in the future.
user1: What was your favorite moment of the film? For me, it was the ending. Very thought-provoking. 
user2: Favorite moment? Perhaps the getting to know each other. I liked how her muteness added to the relationship, rather than inhibited it.
user2: Did you find her muteness added to the storyline?
user2: The whole "difference isn't bad" was important. That seems key in a lot of sci-fi, of which I'm a fan.
user1: Yes, it made her different from the rest of society just like he was also different from other people. They were both outcasts in a way, which made their connection stronger since they could understand each other like no one else had ever tried. 
user2: The supporting cast were also somewhat outcast. The bad guy didn't fit either
user2: What other del Toro films would you recommend?
user1: I think all of them are very good. Which one of the supporting cast was your favorite?
user2: I really liked Giles, but Zelda was really good, too. I have decided I need to see more Octavia Spencer. Incidentally, seeing this movie started me seeing every movie and short nominated for Oscars. I thought Octavia should have taken best actress in a supporting role. I thought Shape of Water was best picture.
user2: What did you think about the look of the film? I loved the look and feel.
user1: The cinematography was great. The contrast between the dark and light in the scenes really made it more suspenseful and emotional. 
user1: What did you think of Sally Hawkins? I had never seen her in anything before. After watching, I think she is an amazing actress. 
user2: The Cold War sensibilities were spot on, too. We feared the other, then, too. The Red Menace. 
user2: Agreed. I loved her in that. She had my vote for Best Active in a Leading Role. She was able to convey so much emotion without words
user2: the guy that played the scientist was good. 
user1: Yes, he gave a great performance. I had never seen that actor in anything else before either. 
user2: Despite a romance with "a fish" what was least believable? I thought the filling up and swimming in the bathroom was a bit silly.
user2: He was also in Call Me by Your Name and, briefly, in The Post.
user1: Yes, that was definitely just for visual spectacle more than anything. I really liked Octavia Spencer's character but find it difficult to believe that she wasn't questioning her friend's relationship more than she did. 
user2: Maybe Octavia's character was sympathetic because her relationship was so frustrating.
user2: "You never say anything and now you won't shut up!" that was a great line.
user2: Did you find yourself a little embarrassed for liking it? It was kind of hard to "defend myself" for liking it.
user1: I wasn't embarrassed for liking it, but most of my friends also liked it. If they had disliked it, then maybe I would feel that way too. 
user2: I don't know anyone else who saw it. I'm in the Army and I was laughed at when I expressed how I thought it was a surefire win for best picture. 
user2: I saw it in a packed little (old) theater with a bunch of old couples, it seems, and we all applauded after. I was stunned at the unanimous outpouring of affection for the film.
user1: I think explaining the concept of the film to people makes it seem more outlandish or crazy than it really is, but when they actually watch the film, it's very easy to become emotionally invested in the characters. 
user2: I liked the healing capability the creature had. Though, as a bald guy, I never thought baldness needed curing!
user2: I agree. Far better to see it
user1: I felt like if people hadn't kept mistreating the creature, maybe the creature would have decided to use his powers for the good of society as a whole. But instead, the villain mistreated him to where he just wanted to do anything to avoid people at all. 
user2: The villain was horrible. He was so easy to hate. Mistreated the creature, his wife, the cleaning staff.
user1: He was terrible! I would like to hope that if humans did encounter another humanoid creature, we would have more compassion than that guy. 
user2: I was a Soldier in the Cold War, and I thought they conveyed that fear/hatred of the other pretty well. I thought we demonized the Russians so we could more easily hate them. He hated the creature and worked hard to justify his hatred.
user2: I am afraid that fear of difference is common. Or so it seems.
user2: I liked the rain in the movie, too. It seemed ever present and added so much texture to the film
user1: I guess a lot of humans already hate other humans quite a bit, so it wouldn't be that surprising of us to start hating the humanoids sadly. And I agree that the rain was a wonderful element of the film; it really kept the characters and audience connected to the water in some way at all times. 
user2: What did you think of the music? I thought it, too, was lovely.
user1: It helped to build the emotion of the film and also kept us in the time period. 
user2: While I'm enjoying our conversation, this HIT is taking a long time, isn't it?
user1: Yes... I thought the new paragraphs would be appearing much quicker. :-P 
user2: I just thought of this film in comparison to "The Little Mermaid". 

conversation:
user1: Hi, HOw are you doing today?
user2: Great, thank you
user2: The movie is called The Shape of Water, have you heard of it?
user1: I have heard of it.
user1: I really don't know anything about it
user2: It is an American Fantasy drama by director Guillermo del Toro
user1: Are there any big names in the movie?
user2: Not really, none I have heard of maybe Octavia Spencer
user2: Sally Hawkins plays Eilsa a mute cleaner
user1: Yeah, I have not heard of them either.
user1: What is the premise of the movie?
user2: The movie is set in Baltimore in 1962, and follows a mute custodian in a high government facility who falls in love with a humanoid
user2: who was captured amphibian creature
user1: sounds different 
user2: Yes, very alien
user2: Elisa was an orphaned child
user2: who was found in a river with wounds on her neck
user1: Did she grow up with a foster family?
user2: It never goes in further into her past, only that she has fallen for the alien creature
user2: She keeps him in her bathtub
user2: The movie has good ratings
user1: HOw did she get the creature?
user1: Doesn't anyone know the creature is missing?
user2: Yes, Strickland discovers he is missing 
user1: That is someone from the facility?
user2: Colonel Richard Strickland discovers him in her apartment
user2: The alien was eating a cat
user1: how the heck did she get it home w/o anyone stopping her?
user2: Not sure, but she plans to release the creature into a canal
user1: I'm guessing that becuase she was a cleaning person she had access to all areas.
user2: Probably
user1: This movie sounds a bit out there
user2: Yes, it does
user2: Will you watch it
user1: maybe 
user2: The creature health starts to fail towards the end

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user1: The Movie is The Shape of Water
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user2: What is it about?
user1: Do you like Fantasy and Drama?
user1: Its is base in 1962 it is based on a mute custodian at a government laboratory who falls in love
user1: She falls in love with a humanoid amphibian creature
user1: From what I understand the movie is quite mesmerizing
user2: It sounds interesting.
user2: Who was in the movie?
user1: Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito, the mute custodian
user1: Michael Shannon plays Colonel Richard Strickland, a corrupt military official
user1: Richard Jenkins plays Giles, Elisa's close friend and interpreter 
user1: Octavia Spencer plays Zelda, Elisa's co-worker
user2: They are all brilliant actors
user1: And Michael Stuhlbarg plays Dimitri the Soviet spy
user1: The movie has a rather high rating on Rotten Tomatoes at 92%
user1: Are you familiar with the director Guillermo Del Toro?
user2: No.  Tell me more.
user1: He is a world-class film artist, unfortunately I have not seen any of his other work.
user2: Is the movie credible? 
user2: I mean, there is an aquaman in it.
user1: I would say it is, it fantasy and drama. If you believe in mermaids, then you would have to believe that there can also be mermen.
user2: Apparently, a lot of critics believe in it
user1: What kind of movies do you like to watch?
user2: I like documentaries, but fantasy is ok.    Didn't this movie win an Oscar?
user1: It did win an Oscar
user2: You think I deserved it?
user1: Yes. Fantasy movies aren't the easiest to produce without the feeling that you reproducing something that has already been done.
user1: Its also take quite a bit of talent to act in water and an amphibious suit
user2: That is one way of looking at it.
user2: So, aquaman won an Oscar too?
user1: Not sure if the creature was awarded an Oscar too
user1: But I feel the movie has enough substance that it is worth watching
user2: Well, if it could win awards, that there is a lot of merit.
user2: So do they end up together?
user1: You'll have to watch and find out. I can't ruin movie.
user2: You can tell me.  For me, it is not what happens, but rather, HOW it happens
user1: So all in all its a story of forbidden love, of course they live "happily ever after"
user2: In the water, I am guessing
user1: Yes, that's where the creature escapes to get away from the police
user2: So she becomes a mermaid?
user1: Exactly, the creature has special powers that allows her to breathe under water
user2: What other powers it had?
user1: The ability to heal 
user1: Also it had the ability to give hair to Giles balding head
user2: Who is Giles now?
user1: Giles was the neighbor and Elisa's closest friend
user2: But aquaman did not have powers to make her talk?
user1: Sadly no, she has been mute since childhood
user2: Well, I guess if he could, then the movie would not have been so powerful
user1: Where language fails, love speaks
user2: How did they fall in love?  
user1: She starting visiting him in secret at the facility where he was being held, they formed a close bond
user2: Well, they were two "freaks" of sorts, so that is understandable
user2: they could relate to each other
user1: She ends up keeping him in her bathtub with the hopes of releasing him into the canal when it opened up to the ocean
user1: In those couple of days her an the creature become intimate
user2: They had sex?  She is not easy.  She kidnapped the man and then that. lol!
user1: Yes, they had sex in her bathroom. Apparently she was able to fill it with water.
user2: She took advantage of his vulnerability.  
user2: Did they both enjoy it?
user1: I imagine they did
user1: She was breaking the law, hiding him away in her bathtub
user1: So do you think you'll go see the movie?
user2: When it comes on Netflix
user1: Understandable
user2: My attention span is too short for the movie theatre
user2: I guess I have two more years to wait

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: Hello
user2: how are you?
user1: Seen any good movies recently
user1: I'm good
user2: I'm dying to see this The Shape of Water movie
user2: have you seen it yet?
user1: I haven't seen it yet
user1: but I hear really good things about it
user1: Who directed it?
user2: sounds very promising I watched the trailer on youtube
user2: Del Toro directed it
user1: I really hadn't heard of it before the Oscars
user2: it's a love story between a mute custodian and an amphibian-mermaid-like creature!
user2: Fantasy-drama
user2: came out in the fall of 2017
user1: Right
user1: a little different than most movies
user1: which is good
user1: at least it's not a cookie cutter movie
user2: yes, would be a nice break from all those super heroes movies and Marvel movies!
user1: definitely
user2: or all these dark and apocalyptic films!
user1: Any idea what other movies Del Toro has directed?
user2: This one is pretty dark, too, but I guess the love situation and the sort of happy ending makes it better
user2: I'm not sure, but I know he is a good director
user1: yeah, it sounds like it has an edge to it
user2: some people think this movie is on the strange side: my husband refuses to watch a human and a mermaid have sex, but I think it is different
user1: had to look up history
user1: ha
user1: that's funny
user1: I guess I'd have to watch it to make that decision
user1: but I wouldn't rule it out just because of that
user2: and this mermaid man is not exactly what you call handsome if you watch the trailer-more like an amphibian...
user2: but still, the story seems beautiful
user1: ah yes, that's right, the creature was a bit different
user1: right
user1: that's the main point I believe
user1: kind of a modern takeo n beauty and the beast
user1: take care

conversation:
user2: hi

user2: yes and it got 92% on rotten tomatoes 
user1: The lady custodian falls in love with a human amphibiod, interesting!
user2: do you usually watch movies based on the ratings ?
user1: No
user1: you?
user2: sometimes
user1: this scene 1 is pretty intense
user2: Sally Hawkins acting was outstanding 
user2: and she performed as a mute cleaner in a very professional way
user1: Wow
user1: I am intrigued by this story. I have not seen the movie
user2: I saw it and enjoyed it very much
user1: I have heard of Director Guillermo del Toro before but sounds like he is talented
user2: he did a really good work in that movie
user2: scene 2 is also wonderful 
user1: sounds cool
user1: scene 3 looks dramatic and action packed
user1: hmm it is set in Baltimore
user2: I didn't know that
user1: seems like an appropriate setting, near DC
user2: cool

user2: omg hahah wow that is a throw back
user1: shape of water,just started this week

conversation:
user1: Hello I think we have both the same inforation 
user2: Yep
user1: infromation 
user2: Looks like a great movie
user1: yep, i has a 92 rotten tomatos rating 
user1: and an A score
user2: Don't come across such feedback every day...
user1: it is a fantasy drama movie, are you into this kind of movies 
user1: ?
user2: Not one of my first picks but would gladly give this movie a chance, looking at the reviews
user1: me too
user1: do you know any of the cast of the movie 
user1: ?
user2: I am not familiar with the movie at all or with the cast
user1: me too, seeing that the movie takes place in the era of the cold war, I'm less intrested 
user2: This seems like a high action movie to me
user2: If it takes place in the cold war, then there has to be some scenes about spies
user2: or some sort of espinage
user1: and there seems to have some kind of romantic aspect 
user2: the project might be dircected at making new weapons against the soviet union
user2: There definatly is a romantic air around it
user2: just reading the into to it
user1: it seems like it 
user2: IDK why its called shape of water
user1: yeah that a weird name for a movie about a secret lab 
user2: Seems like a very odd movie
user2: I beleive the context is centred in a dark, gloomy place
user1: but then again it likes that the mysterious  creature  in the movie lives in water 
user1: which might be the reason for the name 
user2: Thats what I came to afetr reading paragraph #2
user1: the action part is all about escaping the lab 
user2: Seems like the failed experiment of a weopon research
user2: the character also seems Soveit to me
user2: by the name
user1: yeah 
user2: The last part really is weird
user2: the creature giving "CPR" to the lady
user1: yeah, as I read through the file I'm less interested in the movie 
user2: I wonder how the creature manged to learn sign language that fast
user2: I agree
user2: but the reviews were great
user1: thank you very much for great conversion 

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: hello
user2: have you seen shape of water
user1: yes I have
user2: oh cool because i havent
user1: would you like to watch it?
user2: im not sure
user2: was it worth it?
user1: it's enternaining
user1: less worse than what I thought
user2: ah what did you like most about it?
user1: idk, the photography I guess
user2: lol good answer
user2: whats it about
user1: a lady that cant speak
user1: falls in love with a lab-creature
user1: and by lab-creature I dont mean a grad student
user2: ohh well that took a interesting turb
user2: *turn
user1: I guess theres just so much you can say about a movie
user2: true, you said enough tho in my opinion
user2: idk why i choose this movie honestly
user1: lol
user2: i guess name sounded funny
user1: have you seen anything else by Del Toro?
user2: i think he is the guy who did pacific rim? if so then i can only think of that movie atm
user1: Pan's Labyrinth
user2: never seen
user1: it's cool
user1: kind of a creepy and dark fairy tale
user2: ahh and yeah that sounds like his go to style for movies
user2: well anyway good talk
user2: have a good one
user1: you too

conversation:
user1: Hey! Is it snowing where you are?
user2: No the snow just missed us
user2: Im in indiana
user1: Lucky!
user2: where are you
user1: I'm in NYC. What about you?
user2: Indiana, im from Chicago
user2: do you make good money doing Mturk?
user1: I see. I just saw that you had previously answered, my bad...
user2: its cool
user1: Decent money. Have you seen The Shape of Water?
user2: yup...it was ok
user2: what did you think
user1: I didn't see it and I'm worried that there will be spoilers in the information here.
user2: ill try not to
user1: I think the story looks very promising.
user2: the way it was shot gives you a gothem batman feel
user2: but slow and dramatic
user1: Ah? That sounds good, no?
user2: yes very good
user1: I just saw the trailer and it looked good.
user2: yes you should go watch it
user1: It's funny that in the information we're given they don't talk that much about the water man.
user2: lol, yes i see that
user1: It sound slike a great story.
user2: as you can see, it does give it all away
user2: Elisa was a mute
user1: Actually also like a reference to earlier horror movies like Creature of the Blue Lagoon, that sort of thing.
user1: I know... I'll try to forget about the spoilers later. Focus on something else.
user2: yes, blue lagoon, or Thing
user1: Yes. Did you find it scary?
user1: Or disgusting?
user2: the creature in the movie is actually the same character from Hell boy, if you have ever seen that
user2: No not scary or discqusting
user1: Is it!?!
user2: just interesting
user2: yes, the half man half fish guy
user1: In Hell Boy, the creature is very educated and nice and gentle, no?
user2: yes, its just a more serious spin on his character
user1: Was Del Toro involved in Hell Boy?
user2: no i dont thinks so
user1: That's intriguing.
user2: i take that back
user2: yes he was
user2: googled it
user1: And how did it look? There is not much in the document about the visuals.
user1: Aahh... That makes sense then.
user1: I love Del Toro.
user2: extremely good visually 
user2: like hell boy
user1: I'm definitely going to see it!
user1: Loved Hell Boy.
user2: me too
user1: Was nice talking to you! Have a great not snowy day.
user2: stay warm
user2: peace

conversation:
user1: Good morning!
user2: hi
user1: Have you seen the Shape of WateR?
user2: no
user2: how was it
user2: have you seen it
user1: I thought it was great.  A little bit of horror and a little bit of fantasy
user2: is it about that women who falls in love with the sea creature man
user1: Strangely enough yes!  Sally Hawkins falls in love with I guess you could say mermaid or merman?  
user2: haha merman
user2: yeah I saw the previews for it
user2: it looked like it could be interesting 
user2: did you like it
user2: hello
user1: I really did.  It had some parts that were a bit like "Okay don't need to see that" and some really gruesome parts but all in all it was really good.  I think it got really good reviews
user2: what parts did you not really want to see
user1: Mostly her and the merman having sex haha that was strange.  The gore I could deal with though.
user2: are you for real
user1: Yeah seriously.  They have a sex scene in there.
user2: u joling 
user1: It was disturbing
user2: eeewwww
user2: and what parts were gruesome 
user1: Just a little haha.  But if you can get past that without being freaked out it gets good.  
user1: Let's see.  Michael Shannon loses fingers because of the merman
user1: Then he goes on a murder spree at the end.
user2: nice
user2: yeah...maybe I will check it out
user1: And the merman eats one of the cats which is terrible.
user2: so you thought the murder spree was fine but eating the cat was crossing the line
user1: It's a good one to watch if you like something that is a bit out there.  People getting killed is different than innocent animals getting killed.  At least imo
user2: Yeah I like weird type films
user2: i love cats so Im with you
user1: :)  Pointless animal deaths bother me. But if you get past it then its a good movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
user2: yeah maybe I will check it out
user1: Gul del Toro normally does make strange movies but they are always really good.

conversation:
user1: It's interesting to see a mute character in a movie.
user1: Are you there? Still reading the document?
user2: It is, particularly in one which has received such a wide release. Do you generally watch movies which have received good reviews like this one?
user1: Well, I'm a bit wary when it's a raving review, sometimes movies get too much of a "hype".
user1: I go to the movies once a week, so generally I get to see most major releases.
user1: How about you?
user2: I feel that critical response is a good way to judge whether a movie is worth seeing, particularly since there are so many released these days
user2: Did you also find it interesting that the main characters were all marginalised in some way? (e.g. a mute, a closeted gay man and a black woman)
user1: Interesting point. It was definitely a specific "pick" of character.
user2: Is it a movie that you would find yourself watching again?
user1: Maybe if I'd decide to watch some more of the director's movies, but then I know only one more of his works, "Pan's Labyrinth".
user2: Did you feel that the period setting of the movie helped make the story more engaging? 
user1: The Cold War era setting definitely added to the tense feeling of the set. It's kind of sad to see that we're yet again entering some sort of "Cold War" phase with recent political events, do you agree?
user1: The scene described with the creature captured from a South American river reminds me of one of the old horror movies about a swamp creature.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello
user2: do you have movie info on your page
user1: Yes, about The Shape of Water.
user2: okay, we both see it then.  sometimes only one person does
user2: i've heard of the movie but not yet seen it
user1: A mute custodian falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature. interesting! I haven't seen it yet either.
user2: do you like fantasy stuff?
user1: Yes I do.
user2: I often do.  And I've like a few by this director, but not all of them.
user1: It looks like it has great ratings! I would like to see it.
user2: right.  the ratings by critics and audiences are both high
user2: first scene sounds intriguing, with the child found in a river
user1: I like that the main character is female and the creature she meats is the male. It seems like it might more commonly be the other way around.
user1: I wonder if that wound on her neck will relate to the creature later on.
user2: that's true.  it's usually a "mermaid"
user2: i wondered about the wounds, too
user2: do you like any of the actors?
user1: I don't think I'm familiar with any of them.
user2: new scene
user1: Wow she keeps him in a bathtub!
user2: haha
user1: He eats the cat as well.
user2: there's more to this movie than what i thought
user2: i thought it was just a love story
user1: I agree.
user2: last scene
user1: The creature can heal itself. It seems to be more and more of a fantasy movie.
user2: i wish they hadn't given away so many spoilers.  lol
user1: Haha I agree. Now we see the wounds on the neck came back into play.
user2: i'll probably rent this soon
user1: I think I will too.

conversation:
user1: hello ;)
user2: Hi
user1: I love sci-fi/fantasy romance movies, do You ?
user1: hello ?
user2: I like romance with nice endings. I feel like this shows it in a nice way, like how you can be in love with many things and sometimes how you should follow your heart, we me being a male. What is your gender, do you like this plot
user1: I'm male as well. Do You suspect already what title we're talking about ? I didn't say a name of the movie yet ;)
user2: We both have the same set of documents
user2: It says in tasks, :)
user2: Still, I like the scene when she meets the creature and how they interact
user1: in previous batches of this task only one person was seeing the document ;)  I guess something changed ;)
user1: sure, I like the fact that she is mentally handicapped and how she sees the world around her differently... 
user2: I feel like for me seeing different aspects of these different things can really change our perspective and how we treat others. This movie helped me see this.
user1: I agree. Plus I am a big fan of Guillermo del Toro's work. I think this one is one of his most powerful creations so far.
user2: I like how she forms a bond with the amphibian, which might be because she is mute and has a special way of communicating
user1: yes - she has a special way of seeing things and people and emotions. And she liked what she saw in that creature's eyes. She fall in love with it ;)
user2: This really shows me that she took the chance to communicate with the amphibian and that is really cool that they formed a bond. 
user1: Sure. Did You enjoy acting in this movie ?
user2: This shows that she's curious and people like this when curiosity as show in this film can be important. I feel like these are experienced actors and I feel like they put everything out there for the viewers to see.
user1: As much as I see Your point - I don't think it was pure curiosity that interested her in that creature. I think it was the "goodness" that she saw in it. "goodness" that we see less and less in humans these days.
user2: I also feel like with the new paragraph, I really like how it shows sometimes you have to just communicate with someone to see how they are. Like in the paragraph, he is startled and then he slashes his arm
user2: Still, once they calm him down they see that the amphibian means good and heals the man
user1: To the creature, this world is scary and he doesn't really understands it. that's why he was violent in the beginning.
user2: Yeah, sometimes you just got to get to know them, huh?
user1: Never met one so far :)
user2: I like how it is a nice ending. It is really cute how good of a heart the monster has
user2: I liked how it showed you should help others however you can
user1: Well ending was half good...  the creature left her and she was alone again ;)
user2: Giles conveyshis belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after" with the creature.
user2: Maybe they did?
user1: lol... maybe in part two... :)
user2: Do you generally watch movies with good or bad ratings
user1: I watch whatever plot interest me- I never look at the ratings. People that give those ratings sometimes don't know what they're talking about...
user1: Star Wars for example...
user1: rating great - movie garbage ( The Last Jedi )
user2: Yeah, well thanks for your time that was awesome, you are pretty cool!
user1: nice talking m8 ;)

user2: Hello, have you seen The Shape of Water? I did. Do you agree that it is Toro's most stunningly successful works?
user1: My husband and I go to see it last weekend. It was definitely mesmerizing. Unique! 
user1: I was unsure of watching it at first, hearing the words humanoid amphibian creature. I assumed it was nothing I would be interested in!
user2: It is really unique the love between then and all the surrounding events, I agree with you. Did you enjoyed Hawkins' performance?
user1: I think she was great, I really like her. I never would have imagined the love story that occurs.
user2: Exactly it is really surprising. Although all the tragedy the romance takes almost all the attention. 
user1: I dont always follow Rotten Tomatoes, but I definitely agree with the ratings for this movie
user2: Totally agree. I normally don't considering the ratings when selecting a movie, but for this one they are precise.
user1: It isn't so much like Del Toro's past work, the tender love story. But he did a great job
user2: Exactly. I also agree with the response that makes no sense trying to analyze how Del Toro does it. 
user1: Sally Hawkins' role is pretty amazing, so mysterious what happened to her as a baby.
user2: Exactly. Also it is amazing how Cold War period makes an incredible background for such kind of history don't you think?
user1: Yes, I loved the background and setting of the movie. Pretty unique for a newer movie these days. 
user2: Agree. Also Elisa's friends are very interesting and an essential part of the history. 
user1: They are an interesting group of friends, but a supportive group to have as friends I think! 
user1: I cant blame her for being curious about the creature at work, it seems a little far fetched at first
user2: Yes for sure. And considering his life it is normal the curiosity and also the courage to visit him in secret. 
user1: Given her background, I was surprised at her bravery trying to release him into the ocean. Not something I would have expected
user2: Exactly, and also a lot of bravery to keep him in her bathtub and taking care of him. Really surprising.
user1: Quite the task she took on! Then the neighbors cat and slashing his arm, I bet it got hard to keep up doing that.
user2: And I was imagining the risk of all the plan to be discovered by someone else, because all the confusion.
user1: Yeah very risky! I have to say, the romance between them was pretty predictable though. 
user2: At this moment yes. But even predictable it is still surprising in some way.
user1: Well yeah they were a pretty unlikely pair. It gets really intense for a while when they catch on to Elisa.
user2: For sure. The hunt was really breath taking. 
user1: The scenes where they were about to release him are intense. Thinking they both are dead.
user2: Yes and the police arriving also intensify the drama.
user1: I was wondering what his plans were with Elisa's body underwater
user2: Yes, I was wondering if it would be possible to have a happy end.
user1: Yes the movie was definitely well done, to have such an unusual and maybe unrealistic story line. 
user2: Yes, and the end of the history should be on the same level.
user1: My husband didn't care too much for the movie but I thought it was a good one
user2: I agree. It is really nice to see such creative history.
user1: Good talking to you about this movie.
user2: Thank you.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello, how are you doing today?
user1: I'm doing well. You?
user2: I am doing wonderful. Isn't this the movie that won best movie? Have you seen it?
user1: Yes. It is. I believe they won award or two.
user1: I have not seen this movie yet. Did you?
user2: Not yet. I am a fan of del Toro, but this movie seems a little too crazy haha.
user1: lol really? I see the plot is rather interesting. 
user1: The move is about a human falling in love with a humanoid creature. 
user2: Exactly. I think it would have been less funny if you will if it was something other than a fish 
user1: Maybe they found each other due to differences. the woman is mute and the creature... well not exactly the same as a human but had something special about it the woman accepted. It could be spin as heartwarming story like Titanic
user2: Do you usually like fantasy films?
user1: I'm not a big fan of them I like action,drama, horror or comedy films.
user2: Ok. So I take it back. From the first key scene its holding my attention so far. Since she was found in a river, I am curious if that is why she has this attraction towards him.
user1: Yeah that's what's I'm thinking too. Like I said earlier they had differences but it didn't matter to her.
user2: I am also curious to how corrupt the Colonel is working on something like this.
user1: He might want to do a experiment on the creature  and possibly destroy it. The mute lady and her friends will try to stop it from happening.
user1: The movie plot sounds good so far. I might watch the film. 
user1: It also had critical reviews so it's no surprise it won a Academy Award. I think it's something different too.
user2: yeah no kidding. I do find this to be pretty intriguing 
user2: So this creature has healing powers, or the power to make cells regenerate fast. 
user1: I forgot to ask earlier, but do you  like fantasy films?
user2: I don't really care for fantasy films. I get forced to watch them sometimes. I like comedy and thriller. 
user1: Cool. Sorry you are forced to watch them. lol
user2: Me too.
user2: hahaha
user1: lol Well it will be the first for both of us to genuinely like watching a fantasy film like the shape of water
user2: Absolutely. and ready this last key plot i feel like I have seen it lol
user2: But the ending sounds good and I would absolutely still see it.
user1: Same here. Maybe I will watch it soon like over the weekend
user2: Definitely in the near future.
user1: Come to think of it, is the movie Gremlins a fantasy film? It does involve a creature. If it is I love that movie
user2: I think is falls under fantasy horror type 
user2: Ive never seen it.
user1: Yeah you should check it out. It is definitely worth watching!
user2: It's been a while since it came out, correct?

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello
user2: the shape of water has a great ratings
user1: Does it? I haven't read into it much. 
user2: it got an average of 8.4 in rotten Tomatoes 
user1: That's not bad.  What's it about again?
user2: it is about a mute cleaner who was working in governmental laboratory and fell in love with a humanoid amphibian creature.
user1: Interesting.  I wonder if it's a government creation or something captured from the wild.  I would assume the wild.
user2: it was captured for governmental experiments 
user1: Is it a big name cast?
user2: Sally Hawkins played the role of the mute cleaner
user2: while Michael Shannon played the role of Colonel Richard Strickland,
user1: Is it primarily SciFi or a mix of some other genre as well/
user2: it is a mix of fantasy and drama
user2: and a bit of romance
user2: do you like romantic movies or Drama movies?
user1: Depends, some of them are a bit unrealistic.
user2: this one is a bit unrealistic for me
user2: as the cleaner would fall in love with humanoid creature 
user1: Maybe because it's part fantasy due to the creature, it makes the underlying flaws of romantic/dramas not so problematic.
user2: The second key scene explains everything
user2: when she transfer the creature to her apartment and keeps him in her bathtub 
user1: Somehow living in a bathtub doesn't sound like such a fantastic way to live.  
user1: Does the movie explain the creature's origin at all or is it just glossed over?
user2: the creature was captured form a south american river 
user2: but no more details were explained 
user1: Is the creature intelligent? Like a human or less than?
user2: it seemed intelligent and capable of loving a human back
user1: So it doesn't communicate at all?
user2: no, I guess the best part of the movie, is when he is not able to communicate and the cleaner was also mute 
user2: I think that's why she fell in love with it
user1: Hm, I wonder how they'd argue.
user2: haha
user2: i am not sure 
user1: Well it sounds interesting.  Is it an adaptation of a book by chance?
user2: I am not sure
user2: there was no information about that
user1: Okay, any other interesting details?  I don't want to cut the conversation shorter than is required. :)
user2: I guess that's it
user2: you should watch it 
user1: Okay then, I'll check it out.  Thanks for all the info.
user2: you are welcome :)
user2: have a great day. Bye!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello! Let's talk about Shape of Water.
user2: This film has high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and CinemaScore
user1: sure
user1: I watched it
user1: it was really good
user1: The story seems like it was heard before
user1: but it was good none the less
user1: Del Toro made a good movie
user2: I watched it, too. Lots of critics felt the film was masterful. 
user1: Creature is really nicely done
user2: I agree. The blend of fantasy and drama in the film was well done
user1: she acted really good as a def person 
user2: Sally Hawkins performance was great.
user1: to bad she didnt get the oscar
user2: I liked Octavia Spencer's character a lot, too
user2: I thought her performance helped keep the film from being too serious. She was good at providing comic relief while still having depth of character
user2: And Michael Shannon did a great job as Colonel Strickland. He played the character of the macho military man so well. He was despicable!
user1: I agree
user1: I love him as an actor
user1: he is a bit wierd
user1: but in the movie thats on the point
user2: Yes, exactly. I think they were all well-cast for their roles
user2: What do you think about the creature's healing powers?
user1: bathtub scene was nice
user1: they were godlike
user2: Yes, very whimsical 
user1: they are really in love you can see that, tho they are a wied pair :D
user2: Yes, it was weird, but romantic!
user2: Do you think that Elisa and the creature really lived happily ever after underwater?
user1: Yes when I saw the gills I think they did
user1: because she could then live underwater
user1: its hard to catch them in sea
user2: It seemed like that ending scene was coming from Giles' imagination 
user2: that he was hoping that it worked out that way, but doesn't really know
user2: True, they wouldn't get caught easily 
user1: I think its a happy ending
user1: everyone good survived after all
user2: What do you think happened to Giles and Zelda? They were just left behind at the dock where the creature just killed Strickland lol 
user1: I am sorry for the scientist
user2: If the police showed up and there was a dead guy and you said he got killed by a mystical creature, I don't think they'd believe you!
user1: was nice talking to you
user1: have fun
user2: thanks you too!

conversation:
user2: Good morning
user1: Hello, have you seen the shape of water?
user2: I have not seen it, how is it?
user1: It's really great. It's a Fantasy/Drama film 
user2: What is it about?
user1: It's about a mute woman who works as a custodian in a high security government lab and she forms a relationship with a captured amphibian creature
user2: Seems strange to me... Who is in it?
user1: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, and Richard Jenkins
user2: I have not heard of any of those actors/actresses lol
user2: What are the reviews like?
user1: They're a lot of people you may not know by name but they are in a lot of movies 
user1: The reviews across the board are good. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92%, Metacritic gave it an 87%, and Cinema Score gave it an A
user2: Wow, those really are good reviews.
user2: What else happens in the movie?

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you?
user1: Fine, and you?
user1: So we are talking about a movie?
user2: Yeah, we are! Have you watched The Shape of Water?
user1: Yes, I have. Have you seen it too?
user2: Yeah, I saw it and loved it. Did you like it?
user1: I did. It was well done.
user1: What was your favorite part of it?
user2: Yeah, it was great.
user2: I think for me is the scene where the creature and Elisa make love. It's incredibly weird and also romantic and also a complete impossibility that astounded me
user2: What about your favorite part?
user1: That was one of them. I also like the actor who was the opposition and how he was always eating green candies.
user1: I suppose the green candies some how symbolized the monster he was after.
user2: Yeah, Michael Shannon does an amazing job at showing who's really a monster
user1: I liked the overall feel of the movie, seemed to be set in the past although I don't remember if it was set in the past.
user2: Yeah, it's set in the Cold War. That's why the laboratory is a complete secret
user2: Is there something you don't like about the movie?
user1: Right, Russians etc. The lab set was very cool with the water tank etc.
user1: This creature was from the Amazon right?
user2: Yes, they state they captured it in the Amazon, and they even say some aboriginal cultures might worship itas a God
user1: No, I can't think of anything I did not like..
user1: Always reminded me of the Creature from the Black Lagoon, very cool.
user2: How many awards did The Shape of Water win?
user2: I mean Oscars
user1: I did not watch the Oscars, sorry, but I think it won some.
user1: I know this director has done some really good mysteries in the past. If anything, there could have been a little more mystery behind it.
user1: He could have also added more backstory about the creature. We could have gone to Brazil etc.
user1: Did you see "Splash" from the 80's?
user2: Not really. What's it about?
user1: I don't want to spoil it but it has a similar ending to this movie.
user2: Oh Ok. But is it also about a creature?
user1: Splash 1984 Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah. Daryl Hannah is a mermaid.
user2: How have I missed that? Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors!
user1: Ok, so if I was honest I'd say Guillermo borrowed a lot from Splash in order to make The Shape of Water

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi!

user1: Have you seen the 2017 American fantasy drama film "The Shape of Water"?

user1: I do, I usually prefer fantasy movies!
user2: The description of scene 1 is interesting
user1: I love the character of Elisa, I think her story is really touching and the way it develops is both sad and joyful at the same time.
user1: The fact that she keeps the creature in the bathtub, adding salt to the water in order to keep him alive is something, huh
user2: Yes. The govt laboratory would be an interesting place to work. 
user1: Definitely. 
user1: What did you think about the rating of the movie?
user2: On target
user1: And do you usually take in consideration rating before watching something?
user2: yes
user2: Does the document make you want to see the movie?
user1: It does, the trailer wasn't really enough for me.
user1: But it appears that the plot is really well thought. Each conflict looks very well designed. Like the one between Strickland and Elisa
user2: It sounds like you have seen the movie!
user1: I think the performance of the two actors is amazing and it deserves all the positive critical response.
user1: Well, I don't know...I was just interested in it.
user2: well I agree that their performance was good
user1: What about the ending? How do you think it was?
user2: Liked it.
user2: I don't know del Toro as a director.
user1: I liked the last scene where Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after"
user1: Critical response said that the movie has tenderness uncommon to his films. Apparently this is something positive.
user2: yes i thought it was. 
user1: All right then, I think we're done.

user2: I'm doing great, lets talk about a movie! :)

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: Hello
user1: I'm interested in a nice movie
user2: I have a good one to suggest. Have you seen The Shape of Water?
user1: Nope. Who's the leading cast?
user2: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are the leads in the film.
user1: Sounds interesting, what is the genre of this movie?
user2: It's a fantasy drama about a mute cleaning woman who falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature. 
user2: Sounds strange but they make it work.
user1: Is it an animation?
user2: No, it's not.
user2: The woman works in a government lab during the cold war.
user1: Any awards nominations for this cast?
user2: Yes but I'm not sure how many. It won some, too.
user1: Oh wow, do you have an idea who directed this?
user2: The lab has captured a creature who is a humanoid. She meets and feels for the creature because it has human-like feelings, etc.
user2: Guillermo del Toro
user2: It had a CinemaScore of A which is excellent.
user1: Oh cool, tell me more about the humanoid amphibian creature
user2: He was a creature captures from a South American River. 
user1: And is their relationship a taboo in the movie setting?
user2: The woman and her friends steal the creature and she keeps him in her bathtub to keep him alive.
user2: She wants to free him.
user2: Yes, I think it would be considered taboo.
user1: Ok, i see, what is the rating for this movie, is it suitable for a 10 year old ?
user2: No, I don't think so. I think it might be rated R but not absolutely sure. 
user2: The woman and the creature have sex in her bathroom.
user1: Any famous quote from the movie?
user2: Not that I can think of but Giles, her friend, does say that he believes Elisa, the woman, lives happily ever after with the creature.
user2: This is a very unusual love story, to say the least.
user1: Interesting - is it set in the future?
user2: No, it is set back during the Cold War.
user2: The government is ruthless and cares nothing about the poor creature they kept locked up.
user1: The creature is amphibious, so he needs to live in a special room?
user2: Yes, he needs to be kept in salt water.
user2: That's why she kept him in her bathtub when she freed him.
user1: Was the janitor in danger for falling for him?
user2: Yes, She fell in love with him.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hi have you heard about Shape of Water I totally recommend it?
user1: I have heard a few things.
user1: I know it involves a fish person
user1: is it a drama?
user2: Its about a mute custodian who falls in love with the fish person. So yes you could say its a fantasy drama.
user1: who plays the custodian?
user2: Sally Hawkins plays the mute cleaner Elisa Esposito.
user1: where do they meet?
user2: So she works for a secret government laboratory and the fish is one of the experiments.
user1: that sounds interesting
user1: does the fish stay in a tank?
user2: He is captured so he lives in the tank. 
user1: is the fish also mute?
user2: I don't want to spoil too much about the fish but I telling the relationship between the fish and Sally Hawkins is great and unlike any other. 
user1: is the movie funny?
user2: I do not get the sense there is any humor in the film but also Octavia Spencer has a big role and she is a great actress. 
user1: anyone else in it?
user2: Yes Richard Jenkins, Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg. 
user1: who directed it?
user2: It was directed By Guillermo del Toro and its sort of a tormented story with Elisa being an orphaned child trying to take care of the fish.
user1: did it win the academy award?
user2: It has a rotten tomatoes score 92% and a metacritic score 87/100
user1: is it on dvd yet?
user2: Yes it was relesed in 2017
user1: i think i will rent it
user1: how long is it?
user2: I am not sure but It a great story that takes place in 1962 which makes it fun to see how past life was like. 
user1: thanks
user1: did you see it in the theater?
user2: I did not see it in theater I saw it in my home and I thought it was elegant and mesmerizing.
user1: i will watch it
user1: ...
user2: Its a really sad story so I would have tissues I mean she has to visit the fish in secret. 

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hi
user2: I thought The Shape of Water was one of Del Toro's best works. What about you?
user1: Did you like the movie?
user1: Yes, his style really extended the story.
user2: I agree. He has a way with fantasy elements that really helped this story be truly beautiful.
user2: It has a very high rating on rotten tomatoes, too. I don't always expect that with movies in this genre.
user1: Sally Hawkins acting was phenomenally expressive.  Didn't feel her character was mentally handicapped.
user2: The characterization of her as such was definitely off the mark.
user1: I'm not sure which critic said that.  Misses the point.
user1: Might as well label Giles too.  
user2: haha. because he is closeted? 
user2: Whoever made that comment was certainly not well informed and not politically correct by any stretch.
user1: I think Octavia Spencer should look for more roles set in the early 60s.
user2: Do you think that the creature they find in the movie is supposed to be somehow connected to the cold war?
user1: Actually Del Toro does an incredible job showing working people.
user2: That's an excellent point.
user1: Yes, the Cold War invented the Russians, I kind of thought it also represented technology in general.
user2: That makes perfect sense.
user2: I really like that Eliza chose to keep the creature in her bathtub. 
user1: It was interesting that neither power treated the monster well.
user1: Yes the magical realism was truly magical ... easy to suspend disbelief.
user2: Yes. I think it was beautiful that the creature essentially had healing power.
user1: Del Toro does well with violence.
user1: The ending was suspenseful, without being over the top.
user2: What a powerful ending. Even though it was obviously a pure fantasy scenario, there was so much real emotion.
user2: He does do well with violence. I've noticed that in all of his movies.
user2: Del Toro is one of my favorite directors.
user1: Yes, happy endings usually feel fake.  This one felt great.
user2: Totally. It felt like what should have happened, rather than just a sappy pretend ending that was forced on the viewer.
user1: Mine too.  Evidently Hollywood is starting to agree.
user2: It took a while, but yes, finally.
user1: It really appeared to be filmed in Baltimore.  Installation looked so authentic.
user2: Do you know where it was actually filmed? 
user1: No.   Can you imagine soaking in that pool?
user2: :)
user1: Would make a great tourist draw. 
user2: That would be amazing! What a great idea!
user2: Haven't we completed the amount of discussion needed yet?
user1: Place looked like a cross between a nuclear power plant and an aquarium.  I think we hit all the points mentioned.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: what is the movie's name?
user2: Hi! It's the Shape of Water
user2: It stars Sally Hawkins
user2: Do you like movies in the fantasy or drama genres? 
user1: yes, I love fantasy ones
user1: how dramatic is it?
user1: too much drama feels unreal
user2: I suppose it's quite dramatic. It's about a mute woman in 1960s Baltimore.
user1: what does she do?
user2: She falls in love with a humanoid amphibian creature, that's pretty dramatic, right?
user1: seems so
user1: how did she fall in love with him?
user2: I am not sure how that happened, but the movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro.
user1: haven't heard about him. Did he direct any famous ones?
user2: I don't know.If you watch the movie, you should pay attention to the scene where the main character, Elisa, discovers the humanoid amphibian. 
user1: why so? anything special? 
user2: Yeah, once she discovers the amphibian, she starts meeting him in secret
user1: I see, how do they communicate?
user1: she is mute, right?
user1: can the guy talk?
user2: The film got a Rotten Tomatoes score of 92%, so I guess it's pretty good.
user2: Yeah, she's mute. I don't know if the amphibian can talk, but there are some other characters who can talk.
user2: I really liked the scene where Elisa keeps the creature in her bathtub, because I feel like she put a lot of work into keeping it alive, by adding salt to the water, it seems very caring.
user2: SO it sounds like the creature has some kind of special powers, when it touched Giles' (Elisa's neighbour) bald head, his hair grows back the next morning. When you watch the movie, you should definitely watch that scene.
user1: I see. So he has some kinds of healing power?
user1: I wonder if they kiss, he can heal her from being mute, lol
user2: Yes, of some sort. Then after he heal's Giles, he (the creature) and Elisa have sex in Elisa's bathroom.Maybe he could heal her of her muteness, that'd be pretty neat.
user1: Cool. Did the scientist conduct experiments on him? 
user2: Elisa was planning on releasing the creature into the wild, but his health starts deteriorating,  I found this part pretty sad
user2: They're trying to get away from the scientists. Elisa and Giles manage to get the creature to the canal to release him, but then the military official arrives and shoots Elisa and the creature.. they fall into the canal and the creature is able to heal himself and Elisa, so they live happily ever after. I like this part because it has a happy ending.
user1: I see. Normally films like this will have bad ending
user1: But where do they live?
user1: People will keep looking for him
user2: Underwater, he has gils, and when he touches Elisa's neck, she grows gils.
user2: I guess we can't know for sure if they live happily ever after.
