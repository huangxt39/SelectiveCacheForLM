wiki document:
cast:
Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, an immortal Amazon warrior who is the crown princess of Themyscira, and the daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus given to the Amazons to raise, and half-sister of Ares.
Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, an American pilot and the love interest of Diana.
Robin Wright as Antiope, the sister of Hippolyta, General of the Amazonian army, Diana's aunt and mentor.
Danny Huston as General Erich Ludendorff, an iron-fisted general of the German Army during World War I.

critical response:
Never prone to stewing in solitude, and taking more notes from Richard Donner than from Christopher Nolan, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman provides a welcome respite from DC's house style of grim darkness boisterous, earnest, sometimes sloppy, yet consistently entertaining with star Gal Gadot proving an inspired choice for this avatar of truth, justice, and the Amazonian way.
Wonder Woman is a war movie. Patty Jenkins' first and we hope not last entry into the DC Expanded Universe is primarily set  during World War I, but while the feature doesn't balk at war-time violence, it's the internal battles of its compelling  heroine that are most vital.
Diana's scenes of action are thrilling precisely because they're meant to stop war, not to foment it; the idea of a demi-god using love to fight war might sound goofy in the abstract, but Jenkins makes the concept work.

Patty Jenkins

description:
In present-day Paris, Diana Prince receives a photographic plate of herself and four men taken during World War I, prompting her to recall her past. Daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana was raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus to protect mankind. Hippolyta shares the Amazonian history with Diana, including how Ares, Zeus's son, became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who wounded Ares and forced his retreat. 
Initially forbidding Diana to train as a warrior, Hippolyta allows her sister Antiope to train Diana, only more rigorously than any other warrior. In 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by a German ship pursuing Trevor. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, and reveals that a war is consuming the outside world, and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook of the Spanish chief chemist Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas, under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the 'Godkiller'sword, the lasso, and her armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy Ares. 
Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the 'Godkiller'sword, he destroys it, then reveals Diana to be the 'Godkiller', as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the gas to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares'lightning into him, killing him. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Waynethanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve, and reaffirms her new mission to fight and give on the world's behalf.

conversation:
user1: how would have you rated this movie?
user1: from a scale from 0-100
user2: I'd give it a good strong nine. 
user1: 9 out of 10 or 100
user2: Sorry. Didn't see the chat had started. 9 out 10.
user2: 0-100, I'd give it a 97 or so.
user1: I would of gave it a 8 out of 10
user1: great
user1: are you a marvel fan?
user2: I am a fan of comic books. At various times I've read both marvel and DC. Although, MArvel does seem to make better movies.
user2: What did you think of the movie? What was wrong with it?
user1: I was never into comics but watching these movies makes me more of a fan.
user1: I don't think it was anything wrong with the movie. The action was awesome but I prefer other types of movies. 
user2: I will admit, Wonder Woman is the first DC Movie I"ve seen since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies. I do NOT like the new Superman movies. :)
user1: I have yet to see any of the superman movies to be honest.
user2: My wife had a huge crush on Christopher Reeve, from the Superman movies back in the 80's. Has basically said she would divorce me if I saw these new movies. :
user1: I wanted to see the wonder woman movie because its the only movie with a female superhero as the main character.
user1: haha. 
user2: Only female super hero... so far. :)
user2: What did you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
user1: She was amazing.
user1: You really felt that she embraced that role.
user2: I will admit she did a good job. She always seemed.... too small for the role. Maybe I'm just comparing it to the 70's TV show.
user1: I think she would be forever remember as wonder woman. As Christopher Reeves  will be Superman.
user1: She did seem small for the role but she knocked it out the park.
user1: 70 shows compared to shows now are very different
user1: due to technology
user2: Yes, she did. She did very well. The movie, and the star, surprised me with how good they were. Especailly after the mess of the Superman/Batman movie.
user1: I was told that the Super/Batman movie was trash.
user1: I only seen a few parts of it, but I was interested to finishes it .
user2: I have seen trailers and such, and a few bits here and there of Batman/Superman but can't make myself watch it.
user2: I really hope Wonder Woman is the start of some good superhero movies from DC>
user2: So, what'd you think of Steve Trevor? The love interest? 
user1: dreamy
user1: of coarse
user1: Chris Pine is a good actor and his handsome looks make it better.
user1: It was sad that he died at the end.
user1: What did you think of General Erich/Aries?
user2: I think he overdid it a bit. A little to over-the-top. I know Ares is a god and all but... I rolled my eyes everytime he showed up on screen.
user1: I agree, that's why I had to rated it an 8. 

conversation:
user2: ready when you are
user1: Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie with Gal Gadot. It's got a pretty high Rotten Tomatoes score, 96%?
user2: Wow that is a good score. Who plays the main character?
user2: I haven't seen it by the way.
user2: Is Gal Gadot the main character?
user1: Gal Gadot. I haven't seen her in anything before, but apparently she's "an inspired choice".
user1: To play Diana.
user2: Is the movie action packed?
user2: Do you know any of the supporting characters' names?
user1: Quite so. It's set during World War I and is describes as not demurring from depicting from war time violence
user2: Whats its rating as far as kids go?
user2: Is it PG-13?
user1: I'm not sure. You should check that out online for sure. It seems like a pretty good movie for a tomboy. Did you know the movie is directed by a woman? Patty Jenkin's the first woman to direct a live action theatrical movie.
user2: How did it do at the box office?
user1: I'm not sure. But based on the high scores, I'm sure it did well.
user1: And my fave guy, Chris Pine co-stars. He plays a pilot, how dreamy.
user2: he is dreamy. any other big stars?
user1: Robin Wright plays Antiope, her sister. 
user2: has she won any awards recently?
user1: I don't really pay attention to award shows, so that's not something I would know. I love Robin Wright though, I hope they include her in other Marvel Movies. I think she would have actually been a good Wonder Woman. 
user2: are there other marvel characters in the movie?
user1: Nope, but I do get Chris Pine confused for another Marvel Character though.

conversation:
user2: I wonder why there is a gap in the Rotton Tomatoes score and the Metacritic score for Wonder Woman
user1: hello! that is very strange, maybe they have different audiences, did you originally see this as a war movie? I guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies
user2: I do that too, I think of them both as different genres, even though Wonder Woman was set during World War 1.
user1: Yeah I could see them grouping it together, I just usually separate them, I enjoy the actors though, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are great, how did you feel about their choices?
user2: I thought the casting was great, even though this was the first time I ever heard of Gal Gadot.
user1: I was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a DC film haha, usually Marvel runs the place
user2: I agree. I think one of the reasons it was well received was because Wonder Woman was trying to end the war, instead of contributing to a growing conflict.
user1: yeah, a lot of the marvel movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go with it instead of going off an existing one. I enjoyed it though, It is interesting the difference in opinions though, I don't know if I would see a second one 
user2: I think if Patty Jenkins directs a sequel, it would be as good as the first one. She did a great job with this movie.
user1: thats true, if they can keep the cast and crew together I think the chances of it being a hit increase. I believe thats more then 3 exchanges we've had about the movie now
user2: The document just updated for me. One of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted, especially with how Princess Diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies. It is an interesting disconnect.
user1: Oh mine just updated too, sorry about that. I think thats interesting and a good period for the film, I think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing 
user2: I agree. Usually whenever Greek or Roman mythology is presented in a movie it is dense and opaque, but it was easily understood in Wonder Woman.
user1: Yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they're presented. It's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind
user2: The way Ares was punished was also interesting, with only Zeus able to wound him in the battle.
user1: I liked that it was only them left, zues and ares had to fight to save mankind, it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war
user2: I thought it was interesting that the American pilot crashed near south America, connecting World War 1 to the Amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion.
user1: yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations, the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of good side/bad side
user2: Especially with the Germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had, I think that ties very well into everyone's ingrained mortality. 
user1: I also like that Hippolyta allowed her sister to train Diana, giving her the extra she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors 
user2: I felt that was a very feminist-inspired scene, which I really enjoyed seeing in the film. That was a big dynamic in how the World War was almost exclusively fought by men, with the sole woman wanting to end it.
user1: that is a really interesting point that I haven't considered, I know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that
user1: I really didnt except Sir Patrick to Ares, its an interesting dynamic that really came out. 
user2: I thought the scene when Sir Patrick revealed himself as Ares also influenced that, where he wanted to use the Godkiller sword to destroy humanity, but Wonder Woman said no.
user1: yeah I really didn't except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense
user2: I think that was another big feminist point in the movie, in my opinion. The ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when Princess Diana emailed Bruce Wayne
user1: yeah, I think the dynamic between the all the characters fits really well, linking it all togheter, from diana and bruce, to diana and ares, and ares and zues
user2: The casting helped make the movie incredible, the charisma and chemistry between every character showed. The scene where Steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well I think.
user1: Steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too, providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role 
user2: His character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: HEy
user1: Whats up
user2: Just saw a movie based on a DC Comics character!
user1: Cool! Which character is it?
user2: Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot.
user2: Great action film, have you seen it?
user1: No! I really wanted to see it but didn't get a chance yet!
user1: Is it still in the theaters? I'll probably check it out once its available on iTunes
user2: Very entertaining and not the grim dark and sloppy film they sometimes have done.
user1: Nice! haha
user2: Basically a war flick. Gotta love a good Amazon princess movie.
user1: Have you heard anything about when its available on iTunes?
user2: More about her internal battles than the WWI battles. very engaging
user1: mm hmm I've seen the action scene only in batman vs superman
user2: She relies on love to stop war.
user1: is it as good as that scene? have you seen batman vs superman?
user2: Can't hold a good warrior woman down! They tried to forbid her from training but as it turns out, they needed her.
user2: Not sure why it got poor reviews. neat element of mystery too. She was raised on a hidden island for Amazon warrior women.
user2: I haven't seen that movie. sorry I can't compare
user2: sorry, I don't know when it's available on iTunes and missed that question earlier.
user2: Do you watch many movies that way?
user1: I prefer the theaters, but I have a new born so I can't really go to the theaters for a few months! lol
user1: Itunes are okay, but I'd rather watch things on netflix or amazon prime.
user1: Or even better, if direcTV plays them for free, I'll totally watch it
user2: I understand that. I really like the scene in the movie where she receives a photographic plate of herself and some gues from WWI which makes her recall her past. Adds some mystery.
user1: How old is wonderwomen anyways lol
user1: Has she been around for awhile?
user1: Would you say there was a lot of story ? or was it mostly action scenes?
user2: I have no idea how old she is!?! It was a great balance of action and storyline.
user1: haha 
user1: hope I can watch it soon!
user1: is there a part 2 to the movie?
user2: She has a cool "Godkiller" sword she tries to use to kill Ares but he ends up destroying it and making a big revelation to her. (I don't want to spoil the plot so not going to tell you).
user1: Would you watch it again?
user1: ?
user1: yeah please don't spoil it 
user1: lol
user2: Yes I would watch it again. Not sure about the part 2, I don't think so at least not yet.
user2: That Ares character likes to throw his influence around.

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hi
user2: u like to see movies
user1: Have you seen Wonder Woman?
user2: yes i saw
user1: I enjoy seeing movies in the theater
user1: I heard that Gal Gadot did a great job
user2: i enjoyed eith my child
user1: Are you a DC comics fan?
user2: yes
user2: little
user1: How was Chris Pine in the movie?
user2: ok i like
user1: Does Wonder Woman do many stunts in the movie?
user2: have u like to Logon
user2: yes
user2: wonder woman is 7.5 rating
user1: I thought the rating did not do justice to how well the movie did
user1: Oh I did not know that Robin Wright was in it too
user2: humm
user1: She is the general of the Amazonian army
user1: How long is this movie?
user2: yes i like her perfomance
user1: Does it show the run time?
user2: May 2017 its released
user1: I don't understand that
user1: I meant that the movie was released in 2017 or 2015 as per the info
user1: The year says 2015
user2: i said about wonder woman movie
user1: I remember seeing a lot of merchandise and toys about Wonder Woman in stores
user2: ohh k how is it
user1: Does this movie have anything to do with world war or is it a fictional concept?
user2: yesss
user1: So looks like the movie is set in Paris
user2: its wonderful location

conversation:
user1: Hi have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
user2: I have and I loved it! How did you like it?
user1: It was better than I was expecting. Looks like alot of people liked it. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 92% score
user2: Yes, 92% is a great score for the movie, especially with a CinemaScore of an A also. Everyone I know who watched it thought it was great.
user1: I think because it had something for everyone. Action and a beautiful woman for the guys and a strong female character for the gals.
user2: Indeed, plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed a comic book superhero movie.
user1: Ah I didn't catch that. That's right. It makes me want to see the rest of the upcoming DECU movies more
user2: The plot was great, it was about a Amazonian princess who leaves her home behind to try to solve the conflict in the "outside" world. Very action-packed.
user1: Yeah the scenery was great. And Chris Pine too.3.
user2: Of course, who wouldn't want Chris Pine as a love interest!
user1: The Greek mythology was a nice touch to the standard superhero formula
user2: The Greek mythology was great, but I thought it was a bit confusing.
user1: Yeah I'm sure that wasn't explained as well as it should have, but they probably needed to get to the bang bang scenes faster
user2: True, people went for the action for sure. I personally like movies with a bit more of a back story.
user1: Right, I wouldn't mind an extra 5-10 minutes with more detailed story about Ares and Zeus
user2: Yes, that and also about how Zeus met an Amazonian. 
user1: The training scenes were great with her mom the Queen though
user1: I mean her mom's sister, her auntie
user2: Oh for sure! I loved seeing the evolution of how she trained and how strong she got.
user1: I'm glad they made the lasso a strong weapon.
user2: Yes. I also liked the scene when Diana saves Steve when he crashes into the ocean. A woman saving a man in a movie for once.
user1: Yeah there was alot of feminine cheering in the theater for that scene
user2: I hated that her aunt died when the Germans invaded though.
user1: yeah that was sad, pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gravitas to WW's journey
user2: How did you like Sir Patrick?
user1: I was a little surprised by his reveal, but I wasn't paying much attention to everyone else outside of WW, CP and the scenery tbh
user2: I saw that coming. Too predictable that he was Ares I thought.
user1: right, but there's only so much they can do it's a huge movie designed for the masses, not for those with discriminating tastes ;)
user2: Haha, very true! I thought it was neat that they started the story by Diana reminiscing while looking at an old picture though!
user1: yeah the ending reminded me of Captn America with his story in the past and waking up to the modern day world
user2: Yes, but from different universes ;)
user1: Heh at this point it doesn't really matter unless you're really invested in either universe
user2: True. Can't wait till the next installment! 
user1: But with CP taking the bomber away to detonate is just like Captn America going to the Arctic to destroy HIS bomb
user1: yeah, im sure it'll be a great one
user2: For sure, many similarities. I have to say I liked Wonder Woman more so than Batman VS Superman.
user1: Hmmm wonder why this doc hasn't moved on. it's been awhile

conversation:
user1: hi , how are you ?
user1: did you like the movie wonder woman ?
user2: I am good. Thank you. How about you? How did you like the "Wonder woman movie"?
user1: i like the fact that has a lot of action 
user1: what about you ?
user2: I like it. I like it is telling the story of Princess Diana. It is interesting.
user1: yea and i like that chris pine is in it 
user1: what about the director ? 
user1: have u ever heard about her?
user2: Using love to fight war might sound goofy as stated but Jenkins makes the concept work
user2: Not really
user2: How many times did you see this movie
user1: yea me neither , but i guess this movie is a good presentaiton card of her career
user1: probably just 1
user1: i like all those movie about super heroes but i think i prefer other movies better than this on
user1: one 
user2: yeah that's true.
user1: i like though the accions scenes a lot
user1: they were good executed 
user2: It is a warner bros creation right?
user1: a princess trying to stop a war thats always good right ?
user1: yes it is 
user2: Diana was raised on the hidden island of themyscira. Intersting?
user1: but we should take into consideration the bad rating 
user1: very much so
user1: anythign related with history i love to watch
user2: I am not a big fan of a war movie to be honest
user2: Just the heroine's action are little bit thrilling
user1: i am only because sometimes the movie really stick to reality
user1: yea and the outfit 
user1: loved it
user2: American pilot crashes and he is rescued by the heroine which was very ordinary and normal. Same old story
user1: all this story takes place in the ancient worl
user1: dworls thats extremely interesting
user1: what about the actress ?
user1: did u think she was good ?
user2: I like her. Any way the main thing thing is she is leaving her home to end the conflict
user1: right
user2: Gal Gadot as Diana prince/wonder woman has done a good job
user1: that was quite a quest of her
user1: to try to help with a bunch of conflict
user2: right
user1: hmmm but what about the rating of rotten tomatoes
user1: ?
user2: I am not able to trust it completely
user1: i kinda do 
user2: It depend on the individual. I guess?
user1: i read a whole lot of reviews before i watch anything
user2: Thats actually a good thing to do
user1: if not most of the times is wasting time
user2: what do you think about destroying steve's lab scene?
user1: i like it 
user2: when Diana sends email to bruce, it was quite interesting
user2: especially in the present day
user2: Do you know about "Mustard gas" before this movie
user1: no , not really
user1: what about when sir patrick reveals himself as Ares?
user1: i liked that part a lot
user1: was quite unexpected

conversation:
user2: What did you think of Gal Gadots portrayal of Wonder Woman? 
user1: I thought she did a great job.
user1: What did you thinK?
user2: I agree! Loved it. 
user2: I thought she was a great choice.
user1: Me too!
user1: She was unknown to me before.
user1: Do you know if she was in anything before Wonder Woman?
user1: So, what else did you like?

conversation:
user2: Hello. 
user2: Wonder Woman has a really good rotten tomatoes score, which I always look up before watching any movies.
user1: That's cool! I understand this movie has Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. While not familiar with her before this I thought she did a great job as the Crown Princess of Themyscira.
user2: Yes, she did, and I really like that it is a war movie starring a strong female.
user2: Warner Bros. Pictures always makes pretty good movies.
user1: I do too. I also liked it was set during WW1. You don't see many movies in that time period. Danny Huston was really over the top, in the best way, as General Lundendorff. 
user1: I agree with that. I also am a big fan of DC Comics and this is one of the entries in their extended universe. I don't know if you saw it but ever since Diana's appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice I wanted to see more of her.
user2: That was pretty romantic when pilot Steve Trevor crashed offshore of the island and Diana Prince rescued him.  You certainly don't see females rescuing males very much in movies.
user2: I noticed too that the director is Patty Jenkins, which is a female.  That's kinda cool too.
user1: It was nice how the movie flipped the script and made the strong woman rescue the weaker male instead of the opposite you always see in movies. I think the critics responded to that too. There's a real sense of grounding about how war is bad but without beating you over the head with it. Ms Jenkins did that very well.
user2: The year is 2015, but it seems just like yesterday I was watching this movie in the theater.
user1: I agree with Richard Donner that this is a good break from the darkness I'm used to seeing in the DC universe. People die still, but without the grimness of other entries. Yeah! It's hard to believe it's been almost 3 years since this movie came out.
user2: That was pretty neat that Zeus created an island with all women to protect mankind.
user1: What did you think of the scene where Diana takes the picture with the four soldiers and how it ties into her larger history?
user1: It was a good idea. I also liked the concept of Ares, the God of War, getting jealous of humanity and trying to undo us.
user2: I liked all of the movie. It gave me chills watching it.  I see it received a CinemaScore of an A.  That's really good. 
user1: I was surprised the Metacritic score was only 76/100 though. I think was movie was stronger than that rating suggests, still I suppose some people will find fault with anything.
user2: I know it must have been hard for her to leave her home to end all of the conflict, but she knew she had to do it.
user1: That's true. What did you think about how the old world and the new clashed when the German Army ship landed at Themyscira? 
user2: That was awful when Antiope sacrificed herself to save Diana and was killed.
user1: I was just thinking along the same lines. It's a nice way of giving her purpose though since Steve's mission as an Allied Spy doesn't immediately mean anything for her or the other Amazons.
user2: It was chaotic and unexpected. Diana got serious though before she left and had herself armed.
user2: It was good of Diana's mother to let Antiope train her though or she would have been in a mess.
user1: That's true. I enjoy how her determination to defeat Ares and avenge her mother mirrors Steve's plan to make sure Isabel Maru, Spanish chemist, can't make a stronger form of mustard gas to use against the Allies.
user1: I loved how Sir Patrick turned out to be Ares! It looked like he was the only want that actually wanted peace in the earlier sections of the film when he's actually playing at politics to make the war even worse.
user2: I knew she wasn't going to give into Ares to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth.
user1: Me too. I thought it was a great twist to find out SHE was the Godkiller though and not her sword. It was good at underlining the message of believing in yourself.
user2: That was unreal when it showed her recalling memories of her experiences with Steve.
user2: She knew all humans had good within them.
user1: It was, and it was all the sadder when you see him fly that bomber high enough away to make sure the gas Maru had developed couldn't hurt anyone and then sacrifice himself by blowing up the plane.
user2: At least she had a photogenic plate of her and Steve. She had something to hold on to to remember him by.
user2: It all turned out good in the end. She kept on being herself and fighting and giving to the world as a whole.
user1: That's true and it was a nice build up to restoring her faith in humanity. I enjoyed seeing how she told Batman in the present day she'd help fight for the world's benefit again.
user2: Yes!
user2: I kinda thought it was sad when Ares killed all but Zeus. Made me feel sorry for him.
user1: I feel like Ares was probably corrupt like Lundendorff and Maru and couldn't see past his own anger. That's why he, like they, picked violence to solve their problems and to process their grief.
user2: I just noticed German Army is underlined in blue. Guess you can click on that and read more about the German Army during World War I.
user2: It was good the war came to an end and had a good ending though.
user1: Mm hmm, but I don't know what link, if any, that has to the task at hand besides background. In spite of the comedic moments in this at times this movie is certainly properly called a drama. Some of the scenes in 1918 are very intense.
user1: Yeah and I feel like the actions of Isabel Maru in making the nerve gas and the actions of Steve Trevor in stopping it from being used is a nice way to see the good and bad sides of humanity.
user2: Yeah, it does seem kind of weird for it to be labeled as a drama.
user2: It says Superhero underneath it though.

user2: The main character is Gal Gadot, but also stars  Chris Pine, Robin Wright and Danny Huston
user1: what is the movie about?
user2: No i think this movie is a stand alone piece that you wont need knoledge of other movies to understand it
user2: It is a war movie action movie
user1: Do you think this is a family movie for the kids
user2: Are you familiar with any of the actors in the movie?
user1: some of them
user2: I think its acceptable for a family to watch with children
user1: even though its about war
user1: what kind of color pallet  does it tend to use
user2: Yes they don't depict much of the war in the movie its more of theme then actually seeing the war
user1: so is it dark and cold or bright and action
user2: The movie tries to stop the war not be in it
user1: how can one person stop a war
user2: I believe the movie is a little bit of both. Bright for some scenes but dark for when things get gritty
user2: Well shes wonderwoman she has super powers
user1: so is it like a marvle movie
user2: Yes except its in The DC universe instead of Marvle 
user1: is it still out in theaters?
user2: I dont think so im pretty sure its out on Blu ray now

conversation:
user1: What island did Princess Diana grow up on?
user2: Thymycirca
user1: I thought Gal Gadot was fantastic as Wonder Woman, how would you rate her performance?
user2: I believe she did a fabolous job?
user1: Are you a fan of the other DC Comics movies?
user2: Chris pine was also a valuable asset in the movie dont you agree ?
user1: Yes, I really enjoyed him as Steve Trevor and thought he had great chemistry with Gal Gadot
user2: I love all dc comics movie, when i watch these movie its a distraction from everyday routine.
user2: I agree 
user1: I thought that the fight scenes in the movie were particularly well done.  Did you enjoy that aspect of the movie?
user2: Definitely, the quality and special effects blew me away
user2: I particularly enjoy watching female superheros roles being that they are not as common don't you agree?
user1: Yes, I think it's great that the superhero movies are featuring female characters as well as the male ones and I really enjoy that
user1: I thought the movie did a great job of filling in the back-story and giving us insight into Diana's history and motivations.  Did you find that interesting too?
user2: Yes, The movie really did a great job in proving viewers a detail explanation on her life.
user2: I really enjoyed the fact that she was fighting for peace.
user1: Yes, I particularly enjoyed the portrayal that love can conquer war, I like that the movie is based on values like that
user2: I enjoyed taking my niece and and nephew whom  are 10 and 13, uts a great family movie 
user1: Yes, it's a great movie to see with the whole family
user1: Did you have any reservations about them seeing it due to the World War I settings?
user2: No, i did like the contrast of recalling this time period if world war I  and going back to tge present time in Paris 
user1: I did too.  I also loved the updated versions of Diana's sword, lasso and armor.  I thought those were very well done in this movie.
user2: Fantastic!
user1: I thought it was very noble, but also very sad that Steve had to sacrifice himself to destroy the new mustard gas.  Did you like that resolution?
user2: Yes i was in tears, i believe his best performances 
user1: I also enjoyed the reference back to Bruce Wayne at the end of the movie.  I enjoy that all the DC Comics movies are so connected to each other.  Do you find that it enhances your enjoyment of the DC Comics movies when they reference each other?
user2: For sure, it makes it even more thrilling. In the other hand, i ike how they provide u recap at the beginning  just in case viewers are not  familiar with the movies 
user1: In the end, what I really enjoy is the underlying theme that people are still capable of being noble and good, and that there are those who are willing to fight to protect all that's good about humanity.  What do you like most about the movie overall?
user2: So all can enjoy the movie
user2: What I loved most is watching a movie about people fighting  for a purpose. Taking the movie back to world war 1 were there were truly noble  man 
user2: Not afraid to fight

conversation:
user1: I liked Gal Gadot in the new wonder woman movie. what did you think?

user1: I really like the opening scenes showing the Amazons on Themyscira
user1: having world war I as the backdrop was also interesting
user2: Diana and the daughter of  Hippolyta were very sensitive
user1: its like it was a war movie and a comic book hero movie at the same time!
user2: Really Diana was a worrior
user1: DC should really make more movies in the style of this one.
user1: I hope Patty Jenkins makes more movies
user1: what do you think?

conversation:
user1: What's the movie
user2: Good afternoon!
user1: Hello
user2: Wonder Woman. You seen it?
user1: Nope, I haven't
user1: Does it have good ratings?
user2: It’s action packed. Gal Gadot is great as a strong protagonist 
user1: Cool. What other characters are there?
user2: Sure does 92% on rotten tomatoes
user1: Wow that's pretty high
user2: Chris pine from Star Trek is Steve Trevor. A US pilot that meets Wonder Woman after he crash lands in a strange and amazing place
user1: I see
user1: Are there other superheroes in this movie?
user2: It’s part of the DC movie universe as a follow up to Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice
user1: Oh cool, cool.
user1: What time period does the movie take place in?
user2: No other super heroes but she’s all the movie needs anyway. Great direction by Patty Jenkins
user2: It’s a period piece set during WWI. A lot of fun costumes and set pieces too
user1: Ah I see
user1: Does Wonder Woman get involved in the war?
user2: in a way she does. She’s a goddess who seeks vengeance from the god of war and since this is a World War epic, there will be some meddling in others affairs
user1: So there's some mythology involved in this movie?
user2: It has a cinema score of A and it’s definitely worth watching if you like action adventure light comedy and drama
user1: That's a good rating
user1: Light comedy is nice
user2: Indeed. Wonder Woman is also known as Princess Diana. She’s immortal and this film will lead into more current time periods where she still kicks butt
user1: Very cool. I wonder if there will be sequels
user1: Has the movie won any awards?
user2: More than likely. Nothing is out until it’s out but this movie turned the numbers around for the studio as they had been trying to get a foothold in with their DC extended universes 
user1: That's good news

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: hello buddy, u ready?
user1: yep
user1: I didn't know WW's name was diana prince
user2: so the movie's name is wonder woman
user1: yes indeed
user2: got nothing to do with diana prince

user2: well done
user2: :)
user1: Do you like Gal Gadot in this
user2: seems u have seen the movie before right?
user2: nah!
user1: Not in full
user1: Not a christopher nolan type film eh
user2: oh well, they say it has a 92% rating which is good enough for curiosity sake
user1: its funny that 92% translates to average 7.6
user1: German army. Go figure, easy villains
user2: lets just say it crossed 5%..hahaha
user2: I wouldn't watch anything below 5
user1: Diana trained by Antiope
user1: just perusing this document
user2: Pity Diana died, do u think she would have agreed to such a plot?
user1: perhaps
user2: money right?
user1: Is Ares a greek god
user1: money
user2: lol yes!
user1: Set in Paris eh
user1: paris with german invaders
user1: better put wonder woman on the job
user2: but i think the script is not too practical though
user2: figment of someone's dirty imagination
user1: perhaps
user1: These names are weird
user1: Ludendorff
user1: Maru
user1: Bruce wayne in this??'
user2: I didnt see that yet in d script
user2: buddy we can finish..now...hahaha
user2: nice chatting with u matey
user2: lets go enjoy our $2
user2: hahaha
user1: oh ok

conversation:
user2: hello
user2: what do you think about wonder woman movie related to the other dc movies?
user1: hi
user1: well, aside from the obviously "centered around a heroin" I think it's otherwise typical
user1: show a little back story, enter human mortal love interest followed by conflict
user1: I haven't actually watched the film myself
user2: do you believe the love conquer all idea plausible for this kind of movie?
user2: related to the human condition?
user1: maybe it's more like, empathy
user2: not really..she destroyed the whole german army, then the god of war ares, and after that she say that love is the answer, not the war
user2: seems a bit redundant to me
user1: right lol
user1: she should have shown the germans how to love not kill them
user2: what is your idea about this kind of movie? is the heroine not very well represented related to the hero?
user2: x men used to have many heroines - mistique, storm, jane grey
user2: dc does not have many
user1: well, like I said, I haven't seen the actual movie myself. I'm only familiar with the comic books and justice league show and all that.
user1: yea, i agree with you about x-men (marvel) 
user1: even with wonder woman, she's like this patriot symbol, but she doesn't even come from Earth, much less know anything about the american people 
user1: so she's got her intelligence, her strength, kindness whatever. but what is she really after?
user2: did you see justice league?
user1: the tv show haha
user2: her main reason is to stop all wars on earth, after she lost her love in first movie
user2: you seen justice league?
user1: yea I've watched justice league
user2: there is even less info about her, it is just a pretty face to suport, when in fact she is in theory quite powerful
user1: right, but that's what I meant by bringing her in from Themyscira, not really knowing anything. 
user2: that is mostly for the show, i do not believe that plot that she is popping up in society and have no idea what is what
user1: sometimes she comes off as barbaric or uncivilized because she doesn't understand the human race
user1: maybe you're right
user1: did you watch the film?
user2: yes
user2: good enough, but they could do it better
user2: the batman series where on another level, but those late 3 are quite weak related to batman trology
user2: trilogy
user2: looks like this was more like an introduction to the start of justice league movie
user1: they've been making batman films since the 40's though haha
user1: probably what it was
user2: i refer to cristopher nolan ones, as he directed wonder women alse
user2: also
user1: oh i see
user2: batman begins and the other two
user2: ok nice to talk to you, seems that we finished

user1: wonder woman
user2: 7.5/10IMDb
user2: it is a boxoffice movie

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: Hello, I really enjoyed the movie.  It was the best DC movie that has been released in this cinematic universe.
user1: I also enjoyed Wonder Woman. What did you think of the casting of Gal Gadot?
user2: I think she is a hidden gem of actors out of almost no where.
user2: What do you think of the rest of the cast.  Especially Chris Pine?
user1: Chris Pine was alright. I've always been a big fan of Robin Wright
user2: Ya I feel like Chris Pine could have done better, but I did like Danny Huston's character a lot.
user2: What did you think about them setting it in World War 1 era?
user1: True.. I thought whomever played Doctor Poison was pretty effective at a mad scientist
user2: Agreed
user1: It was a good idea. People really get patriotic about a black and white good vs evil when it comes to the World Wars
user1: I was expecting it to get more Oscar nominations.. you know, more than zero
user2: Ya especially for Gal Gadot
user1: She was a shoo-in, I would have thought. Or Patty Jenkins
user2: I thought going with the angle of her being 100% innocent was a little over the top though, but I chalk that up to more writing/directing then acting.
user2: How did you feel about the twist of the villain?
user1: I mean, I think the whole idea was that she's been overly sheltered in a utopia her whole life
user1: It was good! I can honestly say I didn't see it coming. How about you?
user2: I felt the same.  That actor who played Ares I know, but I felt his roll as support was fair enough for his caliber.  It was a good setup.
user1: I think the lasso would be my favorite tool out of her collection. How about yourself?
user2: I felt the lasso was more gimmicky.  I believe the wrist bands and her use of them was pretty awesome.  How did you feel about her level of strength in the movie?  I always have had a problem with how strong DC characters are. 
user1: Haha, yeah, it's a hold over from the comics but it seems like it would be most useful in every day life. :P
user1: I mean, if she was training all day every day and that's all they did, plus she was part god.. it almost seems more reasonable than the other characters. At least more "realistic" in that sense than someone like Batman
user2: Ha, ya you got me their, I would love to have that lasso in the real world.  The wrist bands would be a good paper weight lol.  What about her outfit?  Do you feel like it was suited for combat?
user1: More so than previous portrayals of Wonder Woman.. haha. I liked her trenchcoat look the best, or the dress she snuck her sword under, strictly if we're talking fashion sense
user2: Ya i think the look was better played to modern times.  I think they were restricted to making it similar to the older models though
user1: Did you see Batman V Superman?
user2: I did.  I liked it more than I thought I would after most people said they thought it wasn't that good, but the ending fight, it all fell apart for me.  Wonder Woman was the best part of that movie.  What about for you?
user1: I haven't seen it. :( But now I feel like if I'm expecting just as badass a Wonder Woman movie, I'll be disappointed. Haha
user1: I usually write off these kind of movies as just sort of mindless action flicks because they all seem to blur together but Wonder Woman stood out to me
user2: She's great in it, but she's not in it much.  The majority of the movie is pretty good though,  I think you'll like it.
user2: Yes Wonder Woman was by far the best so far, for DC.
user2: I'm guessing you haven't seen Justice League then?
user1: No..
user1: Oh, looks like time is up. Cheers, it was nice talking to you
user2: Me neither.  I think I'll just wait for it to be digitally release
user2: You too.  Have a good one

conversation:
user2: This movie is phenomenal it has a 92% rating on rotten tomatoes. 
user1: Wow that's a high rating. What's it called?
user2: It's called Wonder Woman and she is born in an amazon island and goes off to end a conflict. Do you want know about the characters?
user1: Awesome! I'd love to know more about the characters!

user2: World War 1. Wanna know what prompts her to recall her past?
user1: Cool! Yes I do!
user2: In present day Paris, Diana receives a photographic plate of herself and four men taken during World War 1, prompting her to recall her past. Wanna know who she is the daughter of ?
user1: Who is she the daughter of?
user2: Daughter of Queen Hippolyta. Wanna know what island she was raised on?
user1: Sure where was she raised?
user2: On an island called Themyscira. Wanna know who trained Wonder Woman to become the force she is today?
user1: Yes! This movie sounds very interesting,  Does she fight in World War 1 too?
user2: Yes she does. Do you want to know how she meets her love interest?
user1: Yes I'd love to know that!
user2: She gets trained by Antiope. She meets her love interest when she is young and when rescuing American pilot captain, Steve Trevor when he his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. Do you want to know who sacrifices their self to save wonder woman?
user1: who sacrifices themselves for her?
user2: Antiope. Do you want to know what special weapons Wonder Woman has?
user1: Oh wow. Yes what weapons does she have?
user2: The weapons she has are "GodKiller" Sword, a lasso, and her armor. Do you want to know who her enemy is in this movie?
user1: Wow GodKiller sounds pretty intense. Yes who is her enemy?
user2: Sir Patrick aka Ares. Do you want to know what he tries to persuade Wonder woman to believe?
user1: Ares? Like the greek god?

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: This movie have good Cast
user1: I love movies based on DC Comics
user2: yES
user1: Do you like this kind of movies?
user2: I loved gal godot as diana.
user1: ?
user2: Some of them, I liked this one.
user2: I assume you saw it.
user2: It was so highly rated at 92% on rotten tomatoes.
user1: Yes and I like when Steve Trevor is rescued by her, one of my fav parts 
user2: Steve trevor was chris pines role, right?
user1: Exactly
user2: he was good.
user1: I like movies with Amazonian Warriors
user2: I just love the whole world and idea of these amazonian women created by zeus to protect mankind.
user1: Yeah and the Island Themyscira is cool
user2: The training is pretty cool too.
user2: I love the idea of the lasso and godkiller sword.
user1: When Antiope sacrifices himself to save her is cool
user2: I think you mean herself, and yes it is very touching.
user2: The chemist to me isabel maru was so creepy.
user2: I think the idea of deadly gas like the mustard gas is just very disturbing.
user1: Yes, is kind of creepy but for a movie is lethal and fast.
user2: I wonder if that is what director patty jenkins was goig for?
user2: going..
user1: Who knows.... we should take a looks to some of her work! haha
user2: We need the lasso  perhaps.
user1: When Sir. Patrick reveals himself as Ares...... oh boy!
user2: I liked Sir patrick as ares.
user2: Lol
user2: Ya
user1: "Goodkiller" sword..... what a think 
user2: I loved how it ended up being revelaed to be diana all  along.
user1: Do you think the rating of this movie is fare?
user2: I think so, do you not?
user1: Yes, i think so
user2: Well glad we agree. it was 7.6 /10 average.
user1: I would need a little bit more of special effects to have a better rating.
user2: I can't believe it came out in 2015.
user2: well 92% is really high.
user1: I agree
user1: I mean is a good movie, but no the best. 
user2: No then it would have been a 100% 
user2: But meta critc score of 76/100 is probably more accurate.
user1: Well It's a Warner Bros Picture......
user2: Fair enough
user2: well it's been nicely chatting
user1: for me  75/100
user2: Have a nice day.
user1: You too

conversation:
user2: Hi how are you doing today ?
user1: Great! How about you?
user2: Nice to hear. I am good as well. Thanks
user2: I recently watched the movie "Wonder Woman"
user1: Do you enjoy super hero movies?
user2: yes of course. I do watch super hero movies very often
user2: do you like such movies ?
user1: Its one of my least favorite genres. 
user2: oh is it ? But this one is great movie to watch. It was directed by the great director Patty Jenkins
user1:  I heard that Gal Gadot was just fantastic in this!
user1: The movie seemed to win praise from across all rating outlets!
user2: that's right. Gal acted as Diana Prince 
user2: Dianas
user1: I didn't realize Diana was the daughter of a queen!
user2:  Diana's scenes of action are thrilling in war scenes
user2: oh is it ? Infact Diana was the queen's daughter
user1: Jenkins does a high-quality job of making it all believable. 
user2: yes. He made this as superb movie. His hard work paid for him. It rated highly everywhere as you said
user1: Its interesting that Diana Prince was raised on the island where the Amazonian warriors were
user1: Its interesting when the Lasso of Hestia was used to interrogate Steve.
user2: yes true. Another interesting scene is that Diana rescues American pilot captain when his plane crashes off the Themyscrian coast
user2: There are lot of such interesting scenes in the movie which impressed audiances
user1: That Spanish chief Isabel Maru was sure up to no good with developing that mustard gas!
user2: You will definitely love this movie
user1: Everyone I know basically has seen it and I haven't heard a bad thing about it at all. It certainly has piqued my interest.
user1: Sounds exciting when Ares destroys the "Godkiller" sword!
user2: It got 76/100 in Metacritic Score
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92%! That sounds awesome.
user2: and also scored 92% on  Rotten Tomatoes rating
user1: Seems like a good thing that Diana realizes humans do have goodness within them.
user2: We also praise the other actors who played equally well
user2: Chris Pine played an American pilot role 
user1: When Diana emails Bryce Wayne, it sure seems like a nod to a future movie, doesn't it?
user2: yep. agree
user2: so nice to talking to you. Hope you will find sometime to watch this movie
user1: I would love to I think!

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you?
user2: Doing well, and yourself?
user1: I'm good thanks. Did you enjoy seeing Gal Gadot as a powerful Amazon Warrior?
user2: I did, I thought it was put together very well.
user2: what are your thoughts on the movie?
user1: So did I, I was glad to see Warner Brothers do it justice. I really enjoyed Gal's role, and Chris Pine did an awesome job as Steve Trevor as her love interest.
user2: Agreed, I have always liked their movies. I wonder if there will be another installment with her in it?
user1: I'm sure there will be. I think it was a pretty big success. I wasn't too impressed with her in Batman v Superman, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised. Did you think Patty Jenkins did a good job as a director or do you think they should replace her if they make another?
user2: I'm with you on that Batman V Superman. I really have not liked those personally in the series either. I think they will keep Patty around. It got pretty good ratings and I am sure it made a fair amount of money.
user1: You're right, 92% on Rotten Tomatoes is pretty rare for a superhero movie. I totally agree about the Batman Superman stuff. The actors don't even seem that into it. Who was your favorite character in Wonder Woman?
user2: I usually like the main characters the most so Gal Gadot really made me enjoy the movie. I was just about to ask you if you think any of the actors could of been replaced to make it better.
user1: Hmm, interesting question. I really don't know. It may be more of a writing issue than an acting issue. But, I think all the actors in Wonder Woman were really well picked. Even the people they got to play the gods were really good. What did you think of the amazon island where she grew up? Do you think they did a good job portraying that?
user2: I did, it set off the vibe really well in my opinion. It captured you to want to know more I think.
user2: The filming was really great there. I wonder how long it took them while they were filming
user1: I agree, it was a beautiful setting. I really liked the character that played her aunt and mentor. She did a great job in turning her into a rebellious warrior.
user1: Me too. I wish I could have been an extra on that set.
user2: I think it was a well timed movie release too for empowering women as well
user1: Definitely, they couldn't have timed it any better really. 
user1: I thought it was really cool how the movie was kind of a play back of the photo of her and her team during the war.
user2: yeah, it was really well thought out. Everything about how it was put together was really great
user1: Also, speaking of the empowerment point you made, I didn't really think about it but they completely reversed the roles of her and Chris Pine when she was the one that saves him from getting killed on the beach.
user2: yeah, I thought it was a fantastic idea to do that.
user1: Yea, even the lore stuff was on point. With her lasso and the Godkiller sword that she used to kill Ares.
user1: Danny Huston did a great job as the evil general as well. 
user2: yeah he did, especially before in that time period no one even knew what the German Army would become by the time WWII came around
user2: How well did the movie follow the comics? I never read any of those
user2: and I know A LOT of people get upset when the movie is not exactly like the comic, lol.
user1: I don't know either. I wasn't a wonder woman fan until this movie. I know the lasso is a big part of the comics.
user1: But, I also think she is supposed to have an invisible jet.
user1: And I'm not sure about the whole Ares thing. If she ever really fought him. Did you think Ares would really be the cause of all the war like she kept saying?
user2: yeah, I've always known more about the Marvel stuff rather than DC personally. I know they have similar structure so I always try to see action hero movies haha
user1: haha yea. To be honest, DC still can't hold a candle to Marvel. They still don't know how to loosen up and not take themselves so seriously.
user2: Yeah, I am assuming they try to refer to Ares like he was the greek one
user2: So, God of War, starts all war kind of thing i think, haha
user2: I agree with you on that about Marvel, haha.
user1: Yea. They kind of faked me out for a little while. I thought maybe she was just too naive to understand that war doesn't take a god.
user1: Oh we're done. Great talking with you.
user2: You too, have a nice day!
user1: Bye!
user2: o/

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hey
user2: we have to talk about the movie
user1: from the description it sounds like a pretty good movie
user1: good*
user2: Yes, it is a good and entertaining option

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: Have you seen Wonder Woman?
user2: Hi! I was reading about the movie Wonder Woman! Saw the Rotten Tomatoes score. It's very rare a movie receives a score that high (92%)!
user1: I think rotten tomatoes can be a bit biased with triple-A movies personally, however, I think it got a fair score. What did you think of the movie from 1 to 10?
user2: Definitely a 9! What about you? I never knew she was an Amazon Warrior!
user1: I agree with most of the critics with a 7 score. I think the movie was great, but I don't think it was immaculate. How do you think Gal Gadot did as Wonder Woman?
user2: I thought she did a great job. Loved Chris Pine as well (and I'm honestly not a big fan of his either). Patty Jenkins did a great job directing it!
user1: I didn't think Gadot would be able to pull off the role, but I was surprisingly wrong. I am not a fan of Pine either. As for the director she made a good impression considering I've never heard of her.
user1: I think the story setting was done properly, not too much deviation from the comic books which I liked a lot. What did you think of the story?
user2: Same here. I hadn't heard of her either. I liked ththe story. I honestly wasn't familiar with the comic but never would have guessed her backstory took place during a World War. What did you think of it - story wise!
user1: I thought it was properly done, and I would have rathered Wonder Woman be introduced in this movie instead of Batman VS Superman. I felt her character just took away from the movie, but in this one, I had no complaints.
user1: How did you like the action scenes?
user2: Agreed! I enjoyed them for the most part. The scene where Steve crashes onto the island shore was well done. How about you?
user1: I liked all the action scenes. They reminded me of Christoper Nolan's Batman action scenes. They were gritty, properly shot, etc. Since you've never read the comics, how did you perceive the origins of Diana? Being born of clay and living on an island of warrior women?
user2: So true! It was very informative and I learned a lot about the character that I didn't know previously. I also loved how they incorporated Ares and Zues into the story. Had no idea it dealt with gods. Did you know that beforehand?
user1: Yes, I knew the mythology behind the story, but really didn't pay attention to it in the movie. I was more absorbed in the story of the war. I always thought the idea of a "hidden" island out in the middle of nowhere was silly because eventually lots of people will find it. In addition to the gods being present just didn't seem right. I mean if I was a soldier in a war and see two gods fighting next to me I'm not gonna really be fighting anyone.
user1: How believable did you find the story or did you just ignore the impossible parts? 
user2: For most comic book films, I try to suspend disbelief so in terms of believability, I suppose for that realm it was believable enough. I do agree with your views. If I was a soldier surrounded by two gods, I wouldn't be fighting anyone either. 
user1: Also, the who was being "orchestrated" by Ares was a bit of a stretch. I think they would of been better off leaving the real reason the war happened in.
user1: What did you think of the supporting cast?
user2: I was a fan of Robin Wright beforehand  (or used to be) and thought her portrayal of Antiope was great. Wasn't familiar with Danny Huston but loved his performance. What about you?
user1: I think everyone did a good job overall. None of the actors seemed overbearing if that makes sense.
user1: What did you think of the villain Isabel Maru? I feel she was a bit forced, but the character was interesting enough to not be annoying.
user2: I agree. How did you like Isabel Maru?
user1: She ok, but not really memorable compared to everyone else.
user1: Now that I think about it, this conflict was over mustard gas which is a bit comical. 
user2: I thought she was unique in terms of the character but that's about it.
user2: What did you think of General Erich?
user1: Erich was good, he was believable in terms of a villain and wasn't over the top which is really important in my opinion.
user2: True. I loved the twist: Sir Patrick ended up being Ares. That was my favorite part in the film. What about you?
user1: I liked the beginning of the movie, to be honest, keeping true to wonder woman's backstory. I like movies that don't deviate from the real origins of the super hero.
user1: What did you think about Steve's sacrafice?
user2: It was sad but needed to be done in order to get rid of the poison gas. I loved how he made her realize humans do have good within.
user2: I'm glad Bruce Wayne was referenced in the film.
user1: Yeah, now that you mention it. I guess his death was needed to further the story. I think he could of just flown the thing over the ocean and crashed it but oh well.
user1: Yeah, all the superhero movies like to give a nod to each other it's pretty cool.
user1: Whelp, we made it stranger! Have a good day!
user2: I suppose that would have been the more rational thing to do.
user2: And same to you! I enjoyed it!
user1: Movies are never rational unfortunately
user1: lol have a good one.
user2: Truer words have never been spoken! Have a great day!

conversation:
user2: Hello! I think you should watch wonder woman!
user1: I have heard of it and am interested in what you think of it. Have you seen it
user2: Yes I have, Gal Gadot acts as Wonder Woman and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor!
user1: I really like Chris Pine but don't know the other actor. What has she been in. Do you know?
user2: I don't know, but she does a great performance. The films is about her character, Princess Diana / Wonder Woman and her scenes are thrilling according to critical response
user1: Sounds good. I guess I will try to see it. Thanks for the input.
user2: Great! You're welcome!
user1: thanks again for the info

conversation:
user2: Hi, Have you seen Wonder Woman Yet?
user1: I've seen parts, never the entire movie.
user1: What was your favorite part
user2: You should see it. It has Great Reviews.
user2: Almost any scene with Diana. She makes all the action Thrilling.
user1: I liked Wonder Woman's strength through out the movie. 
user1: Is Diana the same person as WW?
user2: Yes. Diana Prince is her name. An Immortal Amazon Warrior
user1: Ok, I thought so, but was not 100%
user1: The synopsis makes it sound like a great movie.
user2: Yes. It's Probably the Best DC Comic Movie. 
user2: One scene I did like was when Her mom explained the gods to her. 
user1: So the movie is set in war times?
user2: Yes. World War 1. 
user2: In an early scene we see a pic of her and 4 men from that time period
user2: Which was a present day scene.
user1: Oh, awesome! 
user2: Yep so we know she has been around a long time
user1: I have two boys and they like the other DC comics better
user1: Yeah, that is crazy!
user2: She was in Batman vs Superman. But her movie was much better.
user1: But if she's immortal, it does make sense. 
user2: She was awesome in that movie.
user1: So how does she wind up winning the battle?
user2: Yep. She does not know that though. Her mother wanted to keep her protected from war and violence. Even though that is there hertiage
user1: Oh, does she ever find out?
user2: She eventually does face Ares, who is like her brother technically
user2: She finds out right before she fights Ares what she truly is. 
user1: wow! Does she kill her brother?
user2: Ares explains they are gods, and she should join him
user1: Does she?
user2: She does end up killing him for the greater good of humanity. As she believes we are good people.
user1: Sounds like an amazing movie.

user2: Wait, I only saw the old one.
user2: Should I see the new one too?
user1: You should definitely see the new one! The document says it had 92% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: How are the roles played out when compared to the original? Is it pretty spot on?

user2: How are the action scenes?
user1: They're good, there is a good flashback battle scene with Ares and Zeus
user2: Do the characters stay true to their original stories?
user1: I think so, Diana is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus 
user1: The main plot is good too
user2: Did they do a good job with character outfits? What can you tell me about this plot?
user1: It takes place during world war 1 and Wonder Woman meets a stranded pilot who is a spy for the British
user2: Interesting. Does the ending match the original movie?
user1: He stole a notebook from a chemist who is trying to engineer deadly mustard gas. Diana goes with him to stop who she believes to be Ares and she takes the Godkiller sword, her lasso and her armor with her
user1: She uses the lasso several times to get the truth out of people
user2: Does she have any other weapons?
user1: She has the sword Godkiller, but when she tries to kill Ares with it he destroys it.
user2: Is that the ending?
user1: No, then she finds out that she is the real Godkiller because she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, She battles Zeus and eventually wins
user1: Oops, she battles Ares not Zeus
user2: Sounds pretty similar to the original. Any idea how much it cost to produce?
user1: I'm not sure, it must've been pretty expensive with all the battle scenes though!
user2: Any idea how much money it brought in?
user1: I don't know
user2: Probably a lot

user1: I would like to see it perhaps I like the fight vs good and evil
user2: Before she was Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, Diana meets an American pilot (Chris Pine) who tells her about the massive conflict that's raging in the outside world. Convinced that she can stop the threat, Diana leaves her home for the first time. Fighting alongside men in a war to end all wars, she finally discovers her full powers and true destiny.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: anybody there
user2: wonder women movie -director -patty jenkins- 2015 year
user2: wonder woman is based on the DC comics character of the same name.
user2: Wonder Woman is a 2015 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Patty Jenkins, with a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, and stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. 
user2: Development for a live action Wonder Woman feature film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman attached as producer and possible director
user2: In 2015, Patty Jenkins accepted an offer to direct Wonder Woman, based on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story co-written by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, Geoff Johns and Jason Fuchs.[109] Of this version, Gadot stated that,
user2: Earning a total of $103.3 million on its opening weekend, the film recorded a number of records: the biggest domestic opening of all time for a female director (surpassing previous record holder Fifty Shades of Grey by Sam Taylor-Johnson), the biggest DC Comics release without Batman or Superman (ahead of Constantine), the sixth-biggest non-sequel comic book superhero debut ever, as well as the sixth-biggest June debut weekend.
user2: Wonder Woman premiered in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. It received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for its performances (particularly those of Gadot and Pine), direction, action sequences, and musical score.
user2:  A sequel is set to be released on November 1, 2019 with Jenkins and Gadot reprising their roles as director and lead role respectively.
user2: The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. 
user2: The sister of Hippolyta, General of the Amazonian army, Diana's aunt and mentor.[17] On being cast for the film, Wright said, "It's two-fold because when Patty Jenkins called me, the director, it was a three-minute long conversation. She said, 'I'm doing a movie about Wonder Woman. Do you want to be her trainer?' And I was like, 'Yes. Of course.' And the general of the Amazonian army. 
user2: The Amazon Queen of Themyscira and Diana's mother.[36] On meeting the director for the role, Nielsen said, "Patty and I met in London, and we just hit it off from the get-go. We couldn't stop talking. What was supposed to be a one-hour meeting turned into a two-and-a-half-hour lunch and we just really got each other.
user2: In late 2013, Zack Snyder cast Gal Gadot in the role of Wonder Woman for the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice over Élodie Yung and Olga Kurylenko.[116][117][118][119] Some fans initially reacted to this choice by criticizing Gadot's appearance.
user2: Director Patty Jenkins[115] in response to the interview questions: "Let's talk a bit about Gal. You inherited her from Zack Snyder. Was it difficult to not get to choose your own Wonder Woman?" and "What is it about Gal that makes her such a good fit?"
user2: Wonder Woman has been the subject of a discussion regarding the appearance and representation of female power in general, and of female action heroes in particular.since her initial 1941 appearance in Sensation Comics, as she was created to document "the growth in the power of women", while wearing "a golden tiara, a red bustier, blue underpants and knee-high, red leather boots.
user2: finish
user2: . Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user2: The petition stated that "it is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls".[243][244][240] Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins responded to both the petition and to the U.N.'s decision by stating that she thinks "that that's sexist. 
user2: stop
user1: sorry
user1: for the late
user1: good bye

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello, did you enjoy Wonder Woman? I love watching superhero movies :) 
user1: I did. I think i was a great film. What did you think of the cast?
user2: They chose is very well. I think Gal Gadot was perfect as wonder woman. How about you? 
user1: I don't think anyone else could have pulled of as well as Gal Gadot. What did you think of Chris Pine as Steve Trevor?
user2: Great! I think he really suited Diana as his love interest! Their visuals really suit each other.
user1: Did you see her on Batman v Superman?
user2: I did not, but after this movie, I think I should go and watch it. 
user2: I think the ratings are pretty agreeable. I think 92% is really good
user1: I think the ratings are pretty good too. Although the average is too low for my taste.
user2: Agreed. The average needs to be above average. Do you remember the scene where Diana Prince receives the photo during World War I?
user1: I did. Great scene. Do you remember the name of the island Diana was raised in?
user2: Themyscira, right? Do you remember who Ares was unable to kill?
user1: Yes. Armes was unable to kill Zeus. Do you remember what the women in Themyscira called?
user2: Is it Amazonian warrior? I can't recall...
user1: Yes it is. ...is Wonder women from DC or Marvel comics?
user2: DC comics! Do you remember who forbids Diana to train as a warrior? 
user1: Was it Hippolyta? I'm not sure. 4
user1: Ignore the 4
user2: Yes, that's right! Do you remember how Diana met Steve?
user1: Steves plane crashes off the Themyscirian cost. Do you remember what country invaded the island?
user2: Yes! Germany, right? 
user2: Do you remember who Sir Patrick revealed himself as? 
user1: Yes, he reveals himself as Ares. What does he tell Diana?
user2: He gave humans ideas and inspirations and it is their decision to resort to violence. 
user2: Do you remember who becomes the "godkiller"?
user1: Diana.
user1: What was the name of the Laboratory Steve destroys?
user2: That's right. Maru's laboratory. I can't remember, but did Diana kill Maru or not?
user1: She spare him.
user1: spares him
user2: I  thought the saddest part was when Steve died...
user1: It was really sad

conversation:
user2: It is nothing like the TV show.
user2: The time period is more authentic, the 40',s fighting the Nazis.
user1: There is nothing in the document about the tv show
user1: What do you think about the information in the document
user1: ?
user2: It is blurry and very hard to read.
user2: Enlarging it does not help.
user1: Interesting I am not having any issues viewing it
user2: I like the actors.
user1: It got very high ratings. Not comparing it to another film or tv show do you think it deserved good ratings?
user2: It has same pretty good reviews
user1: What did you think of Gal Gadot's performance?
user2: She was in the old poicture that someone gave her.
user1: I don't understand what you mean.
user2: I guess she thought  it was not an issue back then, proving she's immortal
user2: Or at least long lived.
user2: It is the best DC entry into the superhero genre.
user2: So far.
user1: Do you think that had anything to do with the female director?
user2: Maybe. I was about to comment on that, but just the fact, not that it had an infuence over the story.
user2: Thinking about it, it seems probable.
user2: Gal Gadot preformed well. 
user2: She played it reserved and patiently deliberate.

user2: yes it looked amazing
user2: the cast was wonderful too
user1: Do you like superhero movies normally?
user2: yes but normally the marvel ones
user1: I agree about the cast! I thought Chris Pine was especially great and Gal made a fantastic Diana!
user2: yep the story was good also
user1: I loved that it was an origin story, especially after her debut in Batman v Superman!
user2: yes and i hope we see more wonder women movies
user2: and the reviews are good
user1: I agree! Especially with Patty Jenkins directing again.
user2: yes that makes for a soild movie
user1: I was really surprised by the rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It seems like everyone enjoys the movie!
user2: yes normally it does just okay
user1: I read the CinemaScore was an A. It seems like both critics and fans really enjoyed it!
user2: what do you think about the past for wonder woman
user1: Her past? I think she has a great origin story! I loved that they showed her growing up in Themyscira and how she became Wonder Woman! What was your favorite part?
user2: i guess the fight scenes
user1: You mean when Diana was training with Hippolyta? I thought it was fantastic to show her training and becoming stronger and how that shaped her into being the superhero she is now!
user2: yes it was really great
user1: I thought the scene where she rescued Steve was a great idea, as it showed a little more tenderness after all the fight training!
user2: yes i like that the war was going on in all of this it added tp the story
user1: I agree! I thought it was a great use of history to include the war and have Steve be a pilot!
user2: yes i agree
user1: I especially loved seeing Diana arm herself with the sword and the lasso, ready for battle! Such an iconic moment, I think.
user2: yes but i was sad that steve died
user1: It was so sad! But I think it really helped show Diana that humans have good in them and that she needed to do good, just like Steve did.
user2: yes that's true
user1: I think it was great they tied it into the end of Batman v Superman, where Bruce sent Diana the file containing the photo of her and Steve!
user2: yes that was cool
user2: i had fun talking bye

conversation:
user2: Hey there! What do you think about Gal Gadot as Diana Prince?
user1: are you talking about wonder woman?
user2: Yes, of course. What other Diana Prince is relevant?
user1: I like Gal Gadot in that movie, I thought she was good
user2: I thought the same, I think he was born for that role, although sometimes his tone bothers me a bit, it seems a bit rough and even boring.
user1: whose tone are you referencing?
user2: However, the movie itself is great. Pretty orchestrated and very well presented, better than any other DC before (of the last released, of course).
user1: I would go to see it again
user2: The tone of her voice.
user1: Got it.
user2: Which was your favorite scene?
user1: I thought the opening was really strong, when he discovers the amazons
user1: steve trevor's first contact with them
user2: That was great! I think mine was when she fought with Ares, what a show!
user1: yeah its definitely worth a second look
user2: Yes. It was a big step for DC in the film world. Since it came with fairly weak films (in many points).
user2: Hey there!

conversation:
user2: Hi!
user1: Hi what movie is it that you read about?
user2: Wonder Woman. I think Patty Jenkins did an amazing job directing this one. 
user1: Oh awesome I have been wanting to see that movie
user1: What is the storyline of the movie?
user2: It's a great take on the comic book. Gal Gadot is perfectly cast as Wonder Woman. 
user1: Nice. So the movie starts with how Wonder Woman became a superhearo?
user2: The storyline is basically that a pilot crashes onto the Amazon island and she rescues him. It's during WWII. 
user2: Yes, how she grew up on the Amazon Island and trained 
user1: nice. I can't wait to see it.Do you think there will be a sequal?
user2: Yes, definitely. 
user1: Cool. I like that it starts with how she came to be a superhero and where she came from etc. etc.
user2: It also tells the story of how the warrior women were created by Zeus to protect mankind. 
user1: Who did she save in the crash?
user2: She saved Steve Trevor a WWII pilot
user2: He was played by Chris Pine
user1: Oh so this took place during the war?
user1: so he was alone when he crashed?
user2: Yes, he was alone
user1: So is she pretty young when this happens?
user2: The Amazon women were going to kill him but she saved him
user2: Right, in the beginning of the movie she was just a little girl
user1: So they fall in love I assume
user1: nice
user2: He falls in love almost right away. She was a teenager when they met
user1: I like that I hate when you have to wait for sequals to find out how it came to be
user1: Wow so is he much older?
user2: I think by the ending the sequel to this one is going to be really good. 
user2: He's not that much older, probably around the same age. Soldiers were young during WWII
user1: I can't wait. I have been wanting to see it and now after talking to you I definately need to see it.

conversation:
user1: Hello there, I just watched Wonder Woman with Gal Gadot and agree with Rotten Tomatoes that it is very good.
user2: yes its superhero film
user2: women character is a super hero, i like this 
user1: Wonder Woman is the daughter of Zeus, but she was raised by Amazons to be a warrior.
user2: yes that's wounderfull
user1: I also think that it's a war movie and kind of makes you think about the internal battles that happen to people.
user2: yes, this is a battle move
user1: Did you like Chris Pine as the hero?
user2: may be, but i like the director patty jekins, what abt you
user1: I think she did a great job, especially since she's the first female director of a superhero movie.
user2: yes, i also think wounder full trying as a female director
user1: Diana Prince recieves a picture of herself from a long time ago with four men during WWI, which makes me wonder what the movie is saying about the possibility of time travel or other dimensions.
user2: it's second women theatrical film
user2: yes i agree that
user1: the movie is part of the DC extended universe, like batman vs. superman...do you think there will be a sequel to wonder woman?
user2: yes, that's equal to wounder women
user1: what do you think about wonder woman using love to stop war instead of being a superhero who fights violence with violence?
user2: is this comic book superhero film?
user1: yes, it is part of the Dc extended universe franchise
user2: i am not clear about that, tell about that
user2: film rating also good
user1: wonder woman is based on a comic book series by the same name, and this movie is the big screen version
user1: what do you think about the amazons forbidding diana to train as a warrior?
user2: people very much like compare to comic in big screen
user2: yes
user1: there villain is interesting because he wants to turn earth into paradise, but he wants to do that by killing all the humans
user2: that's awesome 
user2: i think we did enough discussion about this film
user1: the villains attempt to persuade diana to kill mankind fails because diana learned a lot from steve about the goodness of men
user1: we are not done with the task yet
user2: yes interesting
user2: tell me more about this film
user1: it's also cool that the photo of diana from WWI was actually sent by batman, to engage diana in helping mankind stop war

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user2: So how do you feel about this Wonder Woman movie?
user1: It is awesome. The best version so far. I love how Gal Gadot played the role. What about you?
user2: I never saw the movie, but the Rotten Tomatoes rating makes it look like a movie worth watching.
user1: It is. You should watch it. 
user2: I wonder if it is on Amazon Prime. I wish it told you on here. 
user1: The director is amazing too.
user2: Really? I feel so out of the movie loop.
user1: I am not sure but it probably is since its not a new movie
user2: I know Chris Pine anyway.. 
user1: Really? What do you think about him?
user2: Also pretty cool that they have a female director doing a Wonder Woman movie. He is pretty cool, would like to see more him, so more inclined to watch this. 
user1: Yeah they did a really good job, there are funny scene which is refreshing in this type of movies
user2: Oh cool, yea I heard that, but I don't see any mention of it in this article, they just keep saying it is a war movie.
user1: It is, but the way they portray it is a little funny, a bit of romance. Setting is in modern time and she is like walking with a big sword in the crowd like it is normal. Pretty funny
user2: lol that sounds pretty DC. I wonder how they procreated on Amazonia(?)
user1: I know right lol I thought about that too. The ratings is quite high, haven't seen such ratings for a superhero movie
user2: Yea, I wonder if it was better than the Batman v Superman movie she was in before this one.
user1: I kinda like this one better. 
user2: Hippolyta is quite a name. 
user2: It sounds like at least she had relations with a god(Zeus) which is how Diana was born. I guess maybe its Amazon god relations only type of island. 
user1: Could be. 
user1: I would love to see a movie of their story. 
user2: right? I bet it is online somewhere, but not if you have blocker set up..
user2: Oh geez, this came out in 2015, thats nuts. 
user1: yeah? it was shown 2017
user1: They probably started filming 2015?
user2: That would make more sense, but that is pretty misleading. 
user1: Yeah I had to search the internet to make sure lol because I remember watching it last year
user2: I am glad you did because I was just thinking I was going insane and that time was really going by quickly. 
user1: Lol yeah it got me confused too. Nice talking to you.
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: HELLO
user1: Hey there!
user2: I would love to talk about wonder woman the movie/
user2: The one starring gal godot.
user1: Great! What aspect would you like to discuss about this movie>
user2: Well did you know it was based on a Dc comic?
user1: I did! It is the fourth installment in the DC extended universe.
user2: Also the director is patty jenkins, adds to the woman power.
user1: I totally agree. 
user2: She was also the first female to direct a live-action comic book superhero movie.
user1: I definitely think having a woman director adds to the film.
user2: Yes. I agree.
user1: Did you like Chris Pine in the movie?
user2: I did like chris pine in it.
user2: Did you?
user1: Yes. I think his character as the love interest was valuable. 
user2: I  alsothought robin wright was great as Antiope.
user2: Chris pine's character's name was trevor , right?
user1: Chris Pine's character was named Steve Trevor, yes.
user2: Ah.thanks
user2: I think it woudl be fun to go to the hidden island of Themyscira, if only it were real.
user1: Yes, before it was invaded by the German ship.
user1: It was sad to see Antiope die to save Diana.
user2: Ya, with all the training they have the battle might have been a rush to be in though...
user2: Sacrifices like that are hard but heartfelt.
user2: But zeus did create them to protect human kind and she knew diana was the one to do it.
user2: The godkiller is a pretty powerful item.
user1: I agree that the training would be a rush. I thought the scenes of Antiope training Diana were very touching.
user2: I liked those too. I think the Amazonians are great.
user1: I thought it was great that Diana resisted Ares' temptations.
user2: Were you surprised by the reveal of sir patrick  to be Ares?
user1: I was quite surprised by that revelation.
user2: I liked that she turned ares own lightning against him.
user1: Although he claimed to only instill subtle ideas in humans, I think he did much more than that.
user2: Interesting.
user1: I like that it went back and forth from present to past as well.
user2: Well I certainly see how it got the high rating on rotten tomatoes... 92%  
user1: Definitely, me too. I think the acting and the directing were fantastic.
user2: Yes they employed some good techniques.
user2: Yay for patty jenkins!
user1: I think they definitely left it open for future movies to be made.
user1: Especially incorporating Bruce Wayne.
user2: Me too, the ending with gal/diana reaffirming her mission seems to set that up.
user1: Definitely.

user1: Bye!

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello
user1: Hello 
user1: Hi I have a great new movie for you to watch if  you like marvel movies.
user1: The film tells the story of Princess Diana, who grows up on the Amazon Island of Themyscira. 
user1: after an American pilot crashes offshore of the island is rescued by her he tells the amazons about the ongoing world war. 
user1: Are  you there
user1: Diana leaves her home in order to end the conflict.
user1: This is a drama super hero movie
user1: It was made in 2015
user1: This movie is the 4th installment in DC extended universe.
user1: The movie is called Wonder Woman

conversation:
user1: I think that you should see the new Wonder Woman movie if you haven't seen it yet. I don't even like superhero movies that much and It though that it was really good.
user1: It has gotten really great reviews. Including the ones featured on Rotten Tomatoes. 92% and average of 7.6. It is set during World War 1. Great period piece about super heroes.
user1: I hope that you give it a chance it has a great plot and doesn't seem too long. It is the perfect length and features some of the most interesting characters that I have seen in a superhero movie in years.
user2: Even though you don't watch superhero movies that much, would you rate this better than the other superhero movies you probably heard about?
user2: I will. I haven't watched it yet and was looking for movies with good ratings. 
user1: Honestly, I have seen almost every single one of the Marvel movies. I usually don't finish them because I find them long and basically all the same.
user1: It is much better than some of the other Marvel movies. I would say that it is better than most. I do like Gaurdians of the Galaxy. I would put it up there with that.
user1: It's really almost a war movie. Which is strange. It is also good to see a character that we haven't seen a million times. It is by far the best DC movie that they have made.
user2: I see. Most of the marvel movies turn out to have the same plot. 
user1: Correct. This has the normal villian plot but is executed on a better level.
user1: Are you still there? We need to speed this uo.
user1: Hello?
user2: Yes I'm still here. Do we just keep talking about the movie?
user1: Once we send so many messages, it will move on. The acting in this clip is also very good. 
user1: There are some great supporting performances.
user1: The faster your respond, the faster we can get this done.
user2: Yes the acting is very good! Especially Gal Gadot!
user1: I actually liked Chris Pine in this film. 
user1: I am usually not a fan of him.
user1: The action scenes are great as well.
user2: He was good too
user2: I actually just heard of Gal Gadot through wonder woman. 
user2: I didn't know she was also in Fast & Furious.
user1: Me too. I have never seen her in anything else. Besides her brief cameo in Batman v. Superman. She was in that for a minute or so.
user2: I never noticed her in that movie
user1: I haven't seen any of the Fast & Furious movies besides the first two.
user1: I know that Rotten Tomato scores are usually pretty accurate. This film scored really well on there.
user2: Thats true. I always use Rotten Tomato for rating purposes. 
user1: I though that the movie was going to be horrible. Like a female version of a Thor movie. I was suprised. They also show a ton of scenes from her homeland.
user1: The training scenes from her as a child are good too.
user1: I think people are actually calling this a war movie. The set design is great.
user1: Any Comments??
user1: You have to send me something to progress this along
user2: Oh I haven't watch those yet. I'll be sure to watch those late
user1: Even the user ratings are high for this film
user2: Fun fact: the person who wrote wonder women also invented the lie detector test
user1: Chris Pine plays the love interest.
user2: The original name was surprema  but the editor convinced the writer to change it to wonder woman
user1: Danny Huston plays General Ludendorff.
user1: Robin Wright plays Antiope. Dianas mentor.
user1: I only have a small amount of time left on the timer on MTurks. Please respond.
user1: Wonder Woman has a CinemaScore of A.
user2: Danny hutson plays iron-fisted general of the German Army during World War I
user1: Yes. he does.
user1: I love the training scenes of Diana when she was young.
user2: is that in the beginning of the movie?
user1: It is actually peppered throughout.

conversation:
user1: Wonder woman looks like a good movie!
user2: it certainly does
user2: I am pleased to know that it another DC Comics blockbuster

conversation:
user1: Hello, how are you today?
user2: I'm well
user1: Did you enjoy watching Wonder Woman?
user2: I did. I thought it was thrilling. 
user1: So did I. What was your favorite part?
user2: I liked how the action scenes dealt with stopping war, so while it might have seemed cheesy, they were able to pull it off. 
user2: Did you agree with the ratings for the movie?
user1: Yea, Gal Gadot and all the amazons on Themyscira did a really great job. It was very true to the comics.
user1: I think 92% is probably a bit crazy, but I agree with 7.6 from the audience scores
user1: What about you?
user2: Yes, I think 92% is quite high, but I have to realize my bias that I'm not a huge fan of comic book movies to begin with. But, it was very good as a superhero movie. 
user1: Yea same with me. I thought it was well done even though I'm not a huge comic book person. I really liked how the movie was all tied back to the photo of her and her team during the war.
user2: Did you have a favorite scene or scenes?
user1: I liked the scenes when she and chris pine were sharing moments with eachother. They were generally pretty funny. What about you?
user2: I enjoyed the beginning scenes of Amazonian island. 
user1: Yea those were beautiful. I really enjoyed the whole greek mythology theme.
user1: Were you expecting Ares to be the bad guy at the end?
user2: No, the whole Ares thing was new to me. Also, I didn't realize that she was created by Zeus. That wasn't really clear in the TV series with Linda Carter. 
user1: Yea, I had no idea about that part either. What did you think of Robin Wrights rols as the general of the Amazons? Do you think she pulled it off?
user2: Yes, she is fantastic and is tailor-made for that part. I though the whole Wonder Woman storyline took place during WWII not WWI - I wonder if this was just for the movie?
user2: Like, I thought I remember Nazis as being part of the original comic book, but the movie looks like it is set way earlier than that. 
user1: I'm not sure about that. Maybe they didn't want to make her too old? I have no idea. I liked the way the director portrayed the war scenes though. I'm usually not a fan of world war era movies. What did you think about Patty Jenkins as a director?
user2: Yes, that was impressive. I'm glad a female director was able to direct a female-oriented superhero film. What did you think of her directorial efforts?
user1: Yea I agree with that, I think a female was the best choice in being able to capture the feeling of an empowered female lead, especially in the current political climate. She did a great job. Do you think she will be back for the next one?
user2: Yes, I could see her being back. Usually when a franchise starts off really well, like this movie has, they don't like to mess with the formula. 
user1: Ah, good point. Were you able to figure out that Sir Patrick was actually the bad guy? I took me a long while.
user2: Yes, that was a nice plot twist and I didn't figure it out until it was revealed.
user1: Same, I'm glad she finally got to use the GodKiller sword. That would have been a let down if Ares never actually showed up.
user1: Did you think Chris Pine did a good job as the love interest in the movie?
user2: Yeah, the whole GodKiller sword seems like she was endowed with much greater powers than I realized.I'm okay with Chris Pine. His voice sort of wears on me, but I think he did a good job. What is your opinion of Chris Pine?
user1: Haha, I didn't really notice his voice, but I'm sure I will now. I thought he was funny. I really liked the actions scenes with him, especially the one when he went and stole that notebook from the evil scientist. Then flew away and barely escaped. 
user1: Oh, we're done. It's been a pleasure talking with you!
user2: BYE!!

conversation:
user2: Have you watched Wonder Woman?
user1: just now, I was excited that it was a period piece. 
user2: It was not upto  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
user1: Didn't see that. Wonder woman was also directed by a woman. First time in an action film.
user2: Yes Jenkins's role as director is marvellous
user1: The critics really liked it!
user2: But there were lot of negative criticism
user1: I didn't see many negative reviews
user1: Gal Gadot was a great choice as Wonder Woman.
user2: rotten tomatoes were 92%
user2: I think it washer second film
user1: 92% is good! 
user1: I can't remember why she didn't recall her past on Themyscira.
user2: The storyline was interesting
user1: DC has been making so many movies, all sort of interconnected.
user2: yes
user1: I loved the training scenes.
user1: She takes on the world with her lasso and sword!
user2: of course apt as a warrior
user2: Chris pine was also good in his role
user1: He has a good love interest for sure.
user1: Robin Wright was very convincing as well.
user2: she carried her sister role very well and also  as aunt
user1: I can't believe Antiope sacrificed heself.
user1: When she learned that she was the "godkiller" was crazy.
user2: it shows the love for Diana
user1: She saved the world them and seems ready to do it again!
user2: the revealing scene of Diana to be the Godkiller was nice
user1: She was Zeus' daughter.
user2: yes
user1: And the idea of inherent human corruption was compelling.
user2: conclusion was predicted
user1: Yet Diana still found the good in humans.
user2: thats why she spares Maru
user1: I was surprised when Sir Patrick ended up being Ares!
user2: The present day Diana was also great
user1: What if Diana had gone along with Ares to destroy mankind? Would have been a different movie for sure.
user2: yes I agree 
user1: Seems all set for a sequal or 5.
user2: yes she  has given us a clue by saying that her new mission to fight and give on the world's behalf
user1: I'm not huge on super hero movies, but Wonder Woman was different. Good.
user2: I am not of drama type but liked this 
user1: Steve sacrificing himself was sort of like a Jesus moment.
user2: The photographic plate played a role in recollecting her past
user1: I like when she sends the email thanks at the end.
user2: the scenes of action were thrilling
user1: I like the allegorical aspects of the film. The inherent corruption, the sacrifice for humanity, all that.
user2: the idea of demi-god using love to fight war might sound goofy but Jenkins makes the concept work.
user1: I didn't know that WW was in Batman v Superman.
user2: It was her first film
user1: Was that also Warner Brothers?
user2: yes distributed by them
user1: Danny Huston was a great villian. 
user2: but I loved Robin Wright as Antiope
user1: Would love work between a human and an Amazon warrior?
user2: not my taste but this was different
user1: Do you agree with the ratings?
user2: yes I do
user2: How about you
user1: I thought the metacritic rating was a little low. Probably super hero movie fatigue. 

conversation:
user2: wonder woman is a best movie done by gal gadot
user1: yeah i saw that movie
user1: worst villain scene in the movie
user2: she was looks beautiful than any other movie 
user1: yes i accepted this one. i like her.
user1: she works hard to acting to the movie
user2: hard work never fails. 
user1: this film going to another film was dawn of justice
user2: yeah she also play main role in justice league
user1: wonderful movie i ever seen 
user1: she acting well to be a good superhero
user2: do you like superhero movies?
user1: yes i like very much 
user2: which is the best superhero movie you seen?
user1: captain america civil war
user2: oh really
user2: that was my favorite movie
user1: me too
user1: DC comics produce more superhero movies like justice league
user1: gal gadot maybe acting main role in upcoming movie
user2: yeah i am waiting to watch her movies
user2: i love her very much
user1: okay we will talk about wonder woman 
user1: That movie was a huge hit in america
user2: yeah that was a blockbuster hit in all over the world
user1: okay wonderwoman character will be change to someone?
user1: do you like that?
user2: no i neveer support to change the character of wonderwoman
user2: gal gadot is more perfect to act as wonderwoman
user1: yes i agree with that
user2: yes it was more fun 
user1: and then we will talk about marvel movies
user1: nice to talking with you 
user2: thank you so much to give time to talk with you

conversation:
user1: Hello, it is so good to see that Gal Gadot was cast in this movie!
user2: I thought Gal Gadot really outdid herself for this. It was amazing!
user2: I didn't expect Robin Wright to be in the movie though but I'm glad she was. 
user1: It sure was.  It also the first time a female directed a live action comic book superhero movie.  I thought that was pretty cool.
user1: Yes, me too.  She is just lovely and a wonderful actress.  
user2: Do you think the critics were fair?
user1: Yes, and they were mostly positive.  I don't see how someone could say that it was sloppy, though...
user1: How about you?
user2: I agree. I think it was one of the most inspiring and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time.
user1: Me too!  I hope they make a sequel.
user2: I would buy them all!
user1: I missed how the Amazons were created by Zeus.
user2: Honestly I don't recall that story either. Another reason to watch it again!
user1: I enjoyed the love story aspect as well.
user2: I did too. I don't even recall seeing a face put to Zeus?
user1: No, I didn't either.   I thought we would see him.
user2: Do you usually watch Superhero movies?
user1: Yes but this was one of the best I've seen!
user1: It really was a lot less grim than I expected.  I also enjoyed the "fish out of water" aspect.
user2: Yeah it was interesting to me that they focused on the godlike aspects with her and Ares, but still kept it modern with the war.
user1: Definitely.  I liked learning more about her weaponry (the lasso and sword) as well!
user2: That lasso was one of my favorite things.
user1: What did you think about the chief chemist?  
user2: He was awful! He was just as bad as the general. How about you?
user1: Yes, but the villains were fun to watch, I thought.
user1: The training sequence in the beginning was cool too!
user2: It was fun to watch the war scenes during the climax of the movie. They did so great with the graphics
user2: Yeah the training scenes got me hyped for sure!
user1: Yes, they don't really bother me in such movies.
user1: It was also satisfying when Wonder Woman chose to help the humans even though she say that they could be so evil.
user1: *saw*
user2: I know she's supposed to exemplify everything a woman can be, but I couldn't help but notice her armor was hardly anything at all and still remained perfect haha
user1: Haha!  Well, take care.  It was nice chatting with you.
user2: Same to you!

conversation:
user1: hey there!
user2: Hi
user2: Our movie is Wonder Woman.
user1: oh that sounds fantastic
user1: the recent film?
user2: Apparently, she is an immortal Amazon warrior who is the crown princess of Themsycira  and the daughte r of Queen Hipplyta and Zeus
user2: Yes
user2: She was given to the Amazons to raise... and is the half-sister of Ares.
user1: those names are something. is she greek?
user2: Who knows....  I suppose that this just means that she is more immortal than us mere humans.
user2: Robin Wright is in the movie as well as Wonder Woman's (Diana's) aunt and mentor
user1: ok.....who is robin wright? i dont know anything shes in
user2: Have you seen House of Cards on Netflix?  She plays the main charachter's wife.
user2: She was also in a soap opera if I recall
user1: oh snap!
user1: i like it already. i take it this is an action film, being superheroes and all?
user2: Anyway, Diana/Wonder Woman saves a downed WWI pilot and then when she finds out about the world war, she goes to help fight
user2: Definitely... war movie
user1: fight the whole war by herself then?
user2: Maybe not completely, but definitely to help
user1: interesting. who plays wonder woman?
user2: Gal Gadot 
user2: Chris Pine is the american pilot and love interest of Diana/WW
user2: Danny Huston as a WWI general
user1: what a cast!
user1: stellar!
user2: I think that it will be a good one
user2: Apparently other "gods" show up in the movie as well
user2: And it looks like the movie takes place over a number of years or at least has a major flashback in it
user1: sounds pretty cool. wonder woman is....DC?
user2: yes
user2: Patty Jenkin's is the director
user1: never heard of them. what have they done?
user2: Any other questions?
user2: haha.... no clue...   
user2: I have heard of some of their names

user2: but do not know specifically

conversation:
user1: Hi there!
user2: Hello mate.
user1: Do you know of any good movies to watch?
user2: I actually just watched this a couple months ago and fell in love with it!
user2: Wonder Woman
user1: Cool. What's it about?
user2: Woman empowerment
user2: Did you read the description!
user1: No, I don't know much about it.
user2: It should be on the left side ?
user1: No, I think only one person gets to read about it. You tell me about it. 
user1: All I have is the conversation box.
user1: I like empowerment. Tell me more.
user2: Well there's this island of woman and they're closed off from the rest of the world
user1: No men?
user2: and then some bad guys get through the barrier and attack them
user2: no men
user2: all women, they're called the Amazons
user2: they're big and they are warriors
user1: I bet they are bad asses. 
user2: haha
user1: What's next? I assume there are some guys eventually.
user2: Well there's a little girl who ends up being wonder woman she was just born with special power
user2: because her dad was a god
user1: Ok, so she has like magic powers?
user2: She's a super hero
user2: Have you never heard of Wonder Woman?
user1: Excellent.
user1: Just playing the game. :)
user2: She basically fights bad guys when she's older 
user2: this isn't a game
user1: Are there other super heroes in the movie?
user2: no
user2: it's called wonder woman and she's the only one
user1: Do you like the actors in the movie? 
user2: I like Gal Gadot!
user2: she's hot
user1: Ha! I guess she's Wonder Woman?
user2: haha
user2: You should watch it
user1: I think I will! Thanks!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi!  The movie is Wonder Woman.  
user1: Where did you got the movie name but I couldn't see any movie name
user2: I believe in this discussion, you don't see the document.  I'm supposed to read it and convince you to watch it based on information in the document.  
user2: Patty Jenkins was the director.  I was glad to see that they picked a woman director for the film.
user1: Okay so it's your own creation
user1: Who is the music director 
user2: It doesn't say on the document anything about the music.  That's a shame.
user2: The critics only scored this movie 76/100?  What do they know?  This movie deserves better than a "C".
user1: May be but it's a complete movie and I'm interested to know more about the other technicians worked in this movie too
user1: Movie Name is AVATAR
user2: I had another Wonder Woman document pop up.
user1: 3D - Directed by James Cameron 
user1: I haven't got any pop up
user2: That's the first James Cameron film I remember watching.  It blew me away in the theater.
user1: I watched 12 times in Theater and many times at TV - One of my best collections...
user1: Starring Sam Worthington 
user2: I used to own it back with HD DVDGal Gadot p
user2: sorry
user2: I used to own it back when HD DVD'S still existed
user2: I got another Wonder Woman document
user1: Also the musician is James Horner 
user1: I never watch Wonder Woman 
user2: It says on here that Wonder Woman is the fourth installment in the SC Extended Universe.  I hadn't heard that before.  I've heard of James Horner.
user2: It's one of the better movies in the Avengers series.
user1: May be But I like Spider Man & Avengers I & II
user2: Most of the movie is set in 1918, so the clothing and sets are beautiful.  Some of it is filmed on an island.
user1: I believe it's a Marvel Series... Not Avenger Series.. 
user1: Am I correct if i'm not wrong 
user2: Yes, she's part of the Justice League.  Your right.  So basically, it's giving me a run down of all key scenes from the movie.
user1: Thank you.. 
user1: So now i'm eagerly waiting for the Avatar 2 
user1: I love more fictional movies.. 
user1: But I didn't get the chance to watch Wonder Woman 
user2: I didn't know they were making a second one.  That is exciting.  Image how amazing this one will look.  It's been over 20 years, right?   
user1: Next in my list was X-Man
user1: I could see see the Finish Conversation
user2: I love the X-Men movies too.  I don't know what they are going to do about Wolverine's character.  I'm not sure I can accept anyone other than Hugh Jackman in that rold.
user2: role
user1: I'm a great fan of Hugh Jackman.......... and loved his movies... Real Steel , Most Probably Van Helsing
user2: Maybe they will make him younger.  I absolutely love him too.  I hear the Greatest Showman is really good too.
user1: I believe we both can watch Hugh Jackman Movies... 
user1: Shall we finish our Conversation.. 
user1: It' is more than 20 minutes now.. 
user2: ok.  I wasn't sure how this was supposed to work.   Nice talking to you.
user1: Nice talking to you too
user1: same here bit confused... 
user1: Bah bye... have a great day
user2: I'm reading through the directions again
user2: you too

conversation:
user1: Where's the document??
user2: i got it
user1: Okay, sorry!  What's the movie name?
user2: It's about wonder woman the latest movie
user2: With Gal Gadot
user1: Oh cool.  What were the reviews like for it?  Was it any good?
user2: I thought it was okay, but i wouldn't watch it again.
user1: Why not?
user2: I wouldn't spend money to see it in theaters because it's just not that exciting
user1: Ahh.  Who else was in it besides Gal Gadot?
user2: Its like a boring super hero movie most of the time
user2: Christ pine is the other lead the guy who played kirk in star trek
user1: Oh cool I like him.  What was the premise of the movie?
user2: I dont like him as an actor either
user2: It's about the beginnings of wonder woman and how she left her island and got involved in the world of normal man
user2: there are very few action scenes
user2: mostly boring
user2: and the last boss is pretty underwhelming
user1: Interesting. Who was the last boss?
user2: I can't remember his name but he is like pretending to be a good guy through the movie until the end 
user2: it was a pretty lame fight
user1: Was the movie very long?
user2: about two hours i think so stardard
user1: Okay, that's not too bad.  Was it as good as The Avengers?
user2: lol no. Avengers is way better
user2: Wonder woman is a super hero movie that is more like a drama than a super hero movie
user1: Oh, well that sucks.  Was Batman in it?
user2: like i said it was okay, but totally skippable
user2: I can't remember if at the end he has a small part after the credits, but for the most part no
user2: he wouldn't have made the movie better i think
user1: Good, Ben Affleck was a terrible Batman and would've brought the movie down even more.
user2: yeah i don't like him as batman either
user1: Was Superman in it?
user2: no
user1: Were any other superheroes in it?  Or was it just Wonder Woman?
user2: Just wonder woman running around with her crush and some other guys in the middle of a war
user1: Haha.  Were there any other big name actors in it?
user2: No just the two leads and the main boss. and i don't consider pine a big name either
user1: True, Gal Gadot and Pine really aren't huge actors.
user2: After star trek fast and furious edition i don't like pine.

user2: While development for the film began in 1996, Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before wrapping up on May 9, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of the birth of the creator, William Moulton Marston. Additional filming took place in November 2016.
user2: The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war.

user1: hello
user2: Hi!  I was just reading about the movie Wonder Woman.  Sounds like it got some decent reviews too!  Do you like these kinds of super hero movies?
user1: Yes in general I do, and having a women protagonist sounds very interesting
user2: I haven't watched too many of this type, but I like the background tying in with Diana Prince being immortal and an Amazon warrior.  Do you think you will go to see it?
user1: I don't know. You said there were reviews what did they say?
user2: Well, Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 92%.
user1: that's pretty good, who are the stars in it
user2: Gal Gadot is Diana Prince and Chris Pine is Steve Trevor - the American Pilot.  Robin WRight plays Antiope and Danny Huston is General Erich Ludendorff a general of the German Army during World War I.
user1: I don't know any of them lol. Is it in theaters right now
user2: It came out in 2015, but I thought I just started seeing the commercials for it.  Did you know that the Director is Patty Jenkins who is the first female director of a live-action comic book hero movie.
user2: Apparently, the background of the movie starts with Diana Prince talking with her mother, Queen Hippolyta.  Have you ever heard of her?
user1: Well that's interesting Ill have to go see it just because its got a female director
user2: I never knew that Wonder Woman was an Amazon Princess did you?
user1: ya the only strong female leads have to be born of the gods because normal women are weak
user2: Wow.  I've never heard of a hidden island of Themyscira.  Did you know that Zues lives there?
user1: oh wow I did not. I wonder if she is related to thor
user2: Apparantly Zues has a son named Ares who is jealous of mankind and destroys everything, except Zeus.
user1: so wonder woman is gonna have to fight a god!
user2: Well, Ares is her half brother, but he does sound pretty rotten.
user1: sounds pretty interesting ill probably see it at some point
user2: Oh, and also there is the Queen's sister, Antiope, who trains Wonder Woman to be fiercer than any other warrior.  She rescues Chris Pine, the American pilot who crashes off of the island of Themyscira!
user1: after reading all that would you go watch it?
user2: Oh yea, and there is more excitement - the Amazons kills the crew of a ship that lands on the island all the while it was really Ares who was controlling what was going on!
user1: so Ares is the enemy
user2: Yep.  Now don't forget there has to be a love interest - Wonder Woman and the pilot Steve.  Then Ares decides to be an earthly character, Sir Patrick, and convince Diana to destroy mankind.  But she's not buying that at all.
user2: She also has this neat sword called the "Godkiller" sword to fight Ares with.
user1: ooooh a loove interest
user2: Of course, or else women probably wouldn't go see it.
user1: right lol
user2: There are a few other characters of World War I who are involved in experiments and laboratories and making "mustard gas" to destroy people.
user2: Doesn't it all sound exciting?
user1: so exciting cant wait!
user2: Now Wonder Woman is all geared up for fighting for mankind and all that stuff!

user2: Yeah it wasn't that good. It could of been way better. Hopefully part 2 is better this year
user1: I HOPE SO, DC JUST CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER LIKE MARVEL

conversation:
user2: What did you think of the topic?
user2: Did you see Wonder Woman?
user2: Are you a comic reader?
user1: I'm not sure about that, but did you agree with the ratings those sites gave the movie?
user2: I like Gal Gadot I saw her on the Jimmy Fallon Late Show
user1: I thought she was pretty good in Wonder Woman. 
user2: 92 is a pretty good score
user1: Yeah. Interesting though that it got a 92% but only got an average of 7.6 on RT. I guess most people liked it, but they didn't like it all that strongly. So, a crowd-pleaser, I guess?
user2: I am not familiar with the Metacritic score are you?
user1: Yeah, it's 76/100. 
user2: I have heard of the Cinema score before she got an A
user1: Yeah. Seems like Patty Jenkins did a pretty good job. 
user2: I am a big Chris Pine fan
user1: Yeah. What'd you think of the bit where Ares killed all those gods?
user2: I also like the Marvel Movie series ... my favorite is Thor
user1: Interesting. Do you like superhero movies generally?
user2: pretty awesome I like how they intertwined Zeus into it
user2: yes I especially like Thor and Ironman
user2: Those kind of movie tend to give a little natural adrenline rush
user1: What did you think about how they set the movie as a flashback Diana has while she's looking at a picture?
user2: very cool
user2: Sometimes I get the plots mixed up between Area Zeus
user1: Same. What did you think of the costume design when she gets the Wonder Woman armor?
user2: Looks like the new Director Patty Jenkins is really on top with the robe robe arrangements
user2: What did you think about the Amazons killing the crew
user1: I dunno, I feel like it was good on its own but it looked a little strange surrounded by folks from WWI. 
user1: Seemed pretty brutal. 
user1: How about the bit where Antiope dies?
user1: Hello?
user1: Are you there? I'm going to have to abort otherwise. 

conversation:
user1: Hi, I love this movie
user2: Yes, I agree
user1: Gal Gadot did amazing
user2: It is a great movie based on DC Comics
user1: Indeed. I love the costumes in it
user2: She is very talented
user1: She is, she literally is Wonder Woman
user1: It's cool that it was a female director. I didn't realize that
user2: Wonder woman is a war movie. It is good to see a female in this role
user1: Very. I love Steve Trevor too
user2: He is very talented!
user1: And cute haha. Very good acting!
user2: She is recalling her past - good touch!
user1: Yes, I loved how the movie showed the Amazon people
user2: The Amazonian warrior women - cool!
user1: Yep! Good choice of actresses
user2: 92% of people seem to like it
user1: That's a really good amount!
user2: Captain Steve Trevor - interesting plot
user1: Indeed. They were funny and good together
user2: Hippolyts  is also an interesting character
user1: She is. I don't think there was a bad thing about this movie
user1: I love the old photograph of Diana in Paris with the guys
user2: It is very nostalgic
user1: Yep...I love historical movies and this was sorta like one
user2: Sir Patrick - revelation is a good twist in the plot
user1: Yea, a huge plot twist! I did not see it coming
user2: Using Ludendorf and Maru in the process - neat
user1: Very. I'm so sad that Steve died :( 
user2: Yes, that was so sad!

conversation:
user1: I don't see anything about a movie
user2: I’m exactly certain if I can say the title. It did not say, but it is woman wonder, and rotten tomatos gives it 92%. I have only seen bits and pieces of it 
user2: Not exactly certain* sorry, typo
user2: It is based on dc comics so if you like those you may like this 
user2: Starts out on her journey as a little girl to become a superhero 
user2: It is a war movie set In World War One 
user2: Are you there?

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi!
user1: What movie are we talking about?
user2: Wonder Woman
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Yes I have. In the theater. It was a great movie! Are you a fan of DC comics?
user1: I like a lot of their characters, but I'm not a fan of some of the more recent DC movies.
user1: Are you still there?

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you seen the Wonder Woman movie? 
user2: yes I have .it was a good drama superhero movie. 
user1: Yep. Confirmed by the fact that it scored a 92% on rotten tomatoes 
user2: I think chris pine played a good steve trevor an american pilot. he potrays that old timey look
user1: Yeah, and he and Gal Gadot, as wonder woman, have good screen chemistry I thought.
user2: i thought that the fact that it was directed by a female -which is rare- made it even better than other action movies.
user1: Yeah, the first female director of a live-action theatrical comic book superhero movie and it's one of the best of all hopefully will mean more female directors in the future. Plus her name is Patty! Not a lot of women named patty anymore, let alone movie directors.
user2: I also liked how the movie was based in the world war 1 era. it gives a sense of history and fantasy of what could have been?
user1: Yeah, I just wonder how or if they are going to explain the rise of Hitler and WWII because it seems like at the end of the movie she's ended war but maybe they might go down an alternate timeline? Could be interesting
user1:  One critic says this about the movie which I agree with 100%, "taking more notes from Richard Donner thanfrom Christopher Nolan, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman provides a welcome respitefrom DC's house style of grim darkness—boisterous, earnest, sometimes sloppy, yetconsistently entertaining." It felt like what the other DC comic movies in the DCEU (extended universe) should feel like
user2: I am looking forward to seeing other sequels and see how they bring in diana's family from themyscira. I am sure it would be interesting to see how the convey zeus and queen hippolyta in the coming movies.
user1: That could be really interesting, dive deeper into the mythology of Wonder Woman. Maybe bring them into the modern era? Also,  I wonder if Patty Jenkins is going to stay on to direct all the upcoming sequels or if she moves on to other works. 
user2: I think the overall demi god potrays are good. I feel like if patty stayed on she would find some interesting actors and actresses to take on these heroic roles.
user1: There's a movie about the fight between all the gods and Ares but that wouldn't be a wonder woman movie, or at least, I don't know how you would get her to be in it (unless you somehow used time travel which would probably be a bad decision.) 
user1: Do you think with the vast positive reception the wonder woman movie got that the sequel can live up to the first? What do you think the rating on rotten tomatoes would be for the sequel?
user2: Time travel would probably mess up the story line. To me the part where steve trevor crashes on the island was a little loopy. But i suppose in another dimension it wouldn't be so far fetched. 
user2: I feel like the rotten tomatoes score would most likely stay the same. If it did go any higher I would say it would go to 95%
user1: Yeah, Steve and Diana's meeting for the first time wasn't handled great, but that's always a tough thing to write in movies. Add in that Diana lives on a hidden island created by zeus and I'm not sure if you can have them meet in a non-loopy way. 
user2: How do you feel about the critics review. I felt that the word sloppy from one critic was a little harsh.
user2: The scene where ludendorff is trying to create a deadly gas is a good portrayal of how intense the war was back then. 
user1: I thought it was pretty accurate. But all superhero movies have a bit of sloppy to them, I think. The way ares is handled at the end and some of the stuff with the German general Ludendoriff wasn't great
user1: I liked the spanish chief chemist Maru a lot. She was a great comic book type villain. Sad backstory that makes her sympathetic but also a psychopath who you root against. 
user1: I also thought she was played by winona ryder for the longest time, lol
user2: there was a sad part where antiope sacrifices herself for diana. that would be interesting if there was a way to bring her back in some elaborate comeback story.
user2: It was a good scene though when the german ship invaded the island trying to get trevor. there was a lot of action and it was awesome to see women take control. 
user1: yeah, I could see them doing that with Antiope, and it being based on greek mythology where that type of story happens often. I thought showing diana's lasso in only a small part of the movie was a pretty cool trick. I expect we'll see more of her lasso of hestia in the upcoming movies
user2: I am more of a action movie enthusiast so when i saw it was drama I was a little concerned if I would like it. 
user1: yeah, but it's a DC comics based movie. Drama is only to set up the action set pieces (but the drama was still nicely handled I thought). 
user1: Although somewhat expected, I thought making Diana the "godkiller" was a good way to tell the audience just how powerful wonder woman really is. 
user1: Also, it was a nice reveal that the old guy using a cane was the bad guy (god ares) the whole time. 
user2: That is true. I thought it was a little crazy when sir patrick revealed himself as ares. It gave the movie a thriller vibe. It also made you wonder if that is going to be a theme in the next movies
user1: And if bruce wayne/batman is going to be in the future movies (possible love interest?)
user2: I liked how it also cut to the present day and showing diana emailing batman. I feel like there will be chemistry there.
user1: Definitely. Also a nice tribute to her first love and the friends she remembers who helped shape who she was with the plate he gives her. 
user2: It was interesting to see that throughout the decades she still remains the same and doesn't seem to age. I feel like that is going to be interesting in terms of casting in future movies.
user2: It was a little heartbreaking though that her love interest steve died. I feel like they invested so much in the character to just kill him off like that. 
user1: His death is what 'creates wonder woman' so I think it was necessary. And it's why I think the sequel will be in the future (or present day) but maybe they'll do something crazy and have steve come back but this time, he's evil!) (I hope not.)
user2: But i guess there was a silver lining when diana killed ares in the end. it was sort of like payback for creating war on humans and leaving them to act that way. 

conversation:
user2: have you seen wonderwoman?
user1: yea have you?
user2: yes. it is a good movie. i see it has a 7.6 rating out of 10
user1: thats a perfect rating
user1: its an average superhero movie
user2: yes, its pretty new also. 2015 it says. i dont watch many movies but this one was good enough to catch my attention
user1: it actually came out in 2017. idk whay it says 2015
user1: rotten tomatoes reviews are skewed depending on the genre
user2: oh really? good to know! warner bros did a good job with it i think
user1: yea this is the best dc/warner bros live action superhero movie to date
user1: they botched the superman and new batman remakes
user2: yeah, i wasnt able to get enough into those ones to watch the whole thing for either. a movie must really grab me to get me to watch all of it
user1: thats the same for me. 
user2: i like how they did the back story for her in the movie
user1: thats true. it was cool seeing the island where the amazons stay and how she came up
user1: i felt they should not have killed off the love interest so quickly
user2: i think that is lacking in a lot of other superhero movies. a good back story
user2: yes, i agree. it was to quick
user1: yea dc tends to rush backstories like they did in supermans movie
user1: it was nice seeing robin wright play another character other than the one in house of cards though
user2: true. i like how it was a woman saving a man. not enough movies portray that either.
user2: woman superheros are the bees knees
user2: i dont think she got to use the godkiller sword enough in the movie. 
user2: do you agree?
user1: right but at least the accentuated the rope of truth
user1: and woman superheroes are not as fun....
user2: i disagree about that. you must be a man, lol
user1: if marvel came out with a femine hero i wouldnt watch it. only dc 
user1: because its hard to take them as seriously
user1: unless theyre powers are cool
user2: i like how the movie kept you wondering who was who throughout and you didnt really know what was going on till the very end
user1: i like the fact they incorporated ares as the villain
user2: it was deffinately a really good ending
user1: yea that was the best part
user1: the cinematics at the ending was cool too
user2: there is good in all of us humans
user2: i agree. i thknk i need to watch it again after talking about it so much
user1: i know i dont
user2: lol. yeah, you seem like an expert and have seen it enough
user1: and thats so cliche
user2: ive only seen it once and it was a while ago
user1: i used to like superhero movies until marvel saturated the media with corny stuff
user2: there are a ton of superhero movies out there.. most not so good
user1: and i used to be into comics when i was a kid
user2: oh. yeah that helps

user1: It is very interesting. It seems there's also some scenes where Diana recalls her past.
user2: Is there a lot of action, moderate action, little action in the movie?
user1: There seems to be a lot of action in the movie given that Wonder woman joins Steve to join the war.
user2: Is steve a super hero too, or not?
user1: It says he's an American pilot fighting in World War I.
user2: So the time frame of this movie is during world war 1, correct?
user1: Yes
user2: Does wonder woman fall in love in this movie, or not, or hard to say?

user1: It says she has trained to be an Amazonian warrior. She has a "Godkiller" sword and a lasso she uses when fighting.
user1: She believes that Ares is responsible for the war and sets off to defeat Ares.
user2: Do you know the movie sales of this movie, by any chance?
user2: box office gross, i mean to be exact.
user1: No, I'm not aware of the total sales it has made.

user2: Wonder Woman
user2: Gal Gadot plays Diana Prince/Wonder Woman
user1: What genre is it?
user2: Drama, Superhero
user1: How long is it?
user2: I am not sure about that
user2: It is the 2nd live action film for the Wonder Woman character though
user1: Interesting, would I be able to follow the plot without seeing the first movie?
user2: It appears that you are able to; yes. The film follows Wonder Woman as she grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira. 
user2: A pilot named Steve Trevor crashes on her island and Wonder woman rescues him. So you don't need that first movie to pick up the plot from the beginning
user1: Interesting
user1: Are other superheros in the movie?
user2: I don't know about superheros. There is though Robin Wright who plays Antiope and she is the general of the Amazonia army and she is Wonder Woman's early mentor
user2: The main lead male character is Chris Pine 
user1: Cool, is there a lot of actions scenes or is it more politics?
user2: Well according to critical responses someone considers it "a war movie"
user2: There is definitely a lot of action in the movie
user1: Sounds like my kind of movie.
user2: It got 92% on Rotten Tomatoes so a lot of people like it
user1: What is it rated?
user2: It got a CinemaScore of A
user1: Awesome
user2: I'm not sure if it is rated R or not
user2: It got a metacritic score of 76/100
user1: I like fast paced action filled movies. This sounds like a movie I would like to watch.
user2: Awesome! Yeah initially Diana (Wonder Woman) is forbidden to train as a warrior
user2: The Hippolyta lets her sister Atiope train the future Wonder Woman. Then the action starts!
user1: Interesting, I liked her appearance in the other superhero movies.
user1: Is it all in English or other languages spoken?
user2: I haven't seen her other movies. I do know Patty Jenkins directed and captured Gal Gadot's appearance
user2: From what I see all the descriptions of the movie are in English, so I assume it was shot in English
user1: she appears in batman vs superman, great action scenes.
user1: Perfect, I will be adding this to my to watch que. Thanks!
user2: Thank you!

conversation:
user2: Hey there! Have you seen Wonder Woman?
user1: I have seen wounder woman its an awesome movie
user1: have you ?
user2: I have! I didn't realize that it was the 4th installment of the DC universe movies
user1: me either I love how dc conects all their movies just like their comic books 
user2: I agree. I love the actress Robin Wright and was happy to see her in another role.
user1: the director really surprised me as far as comic movies go that really could have been a flop but the did really well in their presentation.Rovin wright was awesome as general and wonder womans trainer
user2: I totally agree with the Critic's score of an "A" for the movie. Do you?
user1: The score was awesome I went and seen it in theaters and bought a copy to go in my collection of blue ray discs
user1: I wounder if they will continue wonder woman in any future movies
user2: I bet they will! You know how they did the different cross overs with Captain America
user2: With such good review from everyone, I have a good feeling they will make more 
user1: yeah I personally think that dc is a little better than marvel at weaving the story lines together...like marvel is havving to catch up 
user2: Can we talk about Gal Gadot?! I would love to meet her in real life. 
user1: I like how they included the mythology in the movie 
user1: yeah gal gadot is a great actress and hot, has she been in anything else....like ads or sitcoms?
user1: I wonder if dc will get around to making the hero's effect the wars we have been in for years? instead of the world war 2 era
user1: the ww1 pic that batman was holding.....wounder how long before those two join up or tangle?
user2: Im not sure!
user2: I would love to see more sequels. I know that this was Gal's first major role. 
user1: yes me to 
user2: I saw her do "Mean Texts" with I think Jimmy Kimmel and it was really funny
user2: The names and places in the movie were some big words! I guess that adds to the mythicalness of it
user1: the 2nd scene they just updated; i liked how she thought the sword was the godkiller but it turned out to be her that was the godkiller ....i kinda hope they keep that aspect where her sword gets destoryed  because otherwise it wouldnt make a lot of sense
user1: a lot of the words seem to stem from the mythology they used 
user2: I liked how they gave background about her sword and lasso
user2: So is she immortal
user1: her v ares was the old movie cliche of good vrs evil but they did it well 
user1: dang how long is this thing lol
user2: HAHA!
user1: what did you think of the final fght scene with ares
user2: I think it was really good! 
user2: I really like the end where she emailed Bruce Wayne
user2: That was a cool twist
user1: yeah thats got to be a setup to a comming movie
user1: can you remeber is this survey suppose to just complete and advance for a completion code ?
user2: I think we completed it! Have a good night :)

conversation:
user1: Chris Pine was an interesting choice for this movie
user2: He would play a good role with his acting skills
user1: True. How do you feel about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman? 
user2: Gal Gadot is a good choice for Wonder Woman! She has such a good talent! Your opinion?
user1: I had never heard about her before this movie, but I liked her in it
user1: It's interesting that some critics are describing it as a war movie
user1: Have you seen this movie? 

conversation:
user1: hello lets talk about this great movie
user1: i love Patty Jenkins as the director
user2: Absolutely. I do as well.  I was a big fan of this film, as were most critics.  How do you feel about the movie, overall?
user1: i think it was one of the best super hero films
user1: and I love the actors
user2: I agree.  It's pretty amazing that Patty is the first female director of a super hero film, focusing on women as the main stars, and it's gotten such great acclaim.
user1: yes taht all makes the movie so much better
user2: I also think that the time travel aspect is interesting.
user1: yeah the plot was intresting
user2: I hope that they choose to make additional films focusing on Wonder Woman.
user2: She seems to be a fan favorite.
user2: And they certainly did a wonderful job with her first feature film.
user1: yes it was better than batman v super man
user1: what do you think about the first key scene
user2: I thought that it was a fun way to present her character.  Showing that she is timeless and potentially immortal.
user2: Showing a very old photo with her looking identical to her present-day self.
user1: yes that was very intresting
user2: What do you think about the lore surrounding Wonder Woman?
user2: Her lineage, family, that sort of thing?
user1: I think that the war subplot was great
user1: and her family seems great
user1: from a plot point of view
user2: I absolutely agree.  I also really enjoyed Steve Trevor flying cross-dimension and his eventual capture by the Amazons.  It was a fun way to portray his escape from the Germans.
user1: yes 
user2: I also think that it's interesting that they have the German Army as an enemy, but also have a god as a greater antagonist.
user1: yes the war made it very good 
user2: What did you think of the magical weaponry in the movie?
user1: i think it was cool
user1: it was sad that  steve had to die
user2: I agree.  But it made the scene very tense and climactic, which was good for the film overall.
user1: yes I love it 
user1: I really hope that we can get a second movie
user2: I do too.  I think that it would do well for the DC franchise.
user2: Wonder Woman had great growth through the film.
user1: yes they have not had a good time with some of their other movies
user1: yes she was great
user1: thanks for the talk about the movie
user2: And her choice to spare Maru at the end, leading her to be the person that she is today is pretty wonderful.
user2: Thank you, I had a great time.
user1: bye 

conversation:
user1: Hi. Have you seen this movie? What did you think of it?
user2: Yes, I've seen the movie. I thought that it was better than all the other recent DC movies, but to be honest, I don't know if it deserved a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. What about you?
user1: I did like it better than the other DC movies. Not as Dark and dismal as they always are. It also had a bit more humor, which was refreshing, but i think that was the casting of Pine more than anything
user1: I honestly have never understood rotten tomatoes percentages, half the time i agree, half the time i don't
user1: personally i still prefer Marvel to DC
user2: I agree. Rotten Tomatoes definitely seems to be biased towards certain movies from what I see. And yes, Marvel is WAY better. But back to Wonder Woman, what did you think of Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman?
user1: It was definitely a stretch from Linda Carter... but if i separate the show from the movie, I liked her.
user1: nice to see strength and curves for once and not just sex
user2: Yeah totally. I was afraid that it was going to be all just sexy shots of Wonder Woman who happens to also fight, but they did a pretty good job of making it not about sexiness at all.
user2: I don't know why previous movies with female superheroes couldn't do this way beforehand.
user1: I have to admit,I liked the twist at the end of who the villain really was. I totally missed that.
user1: Casting there was really good too.  He was not your typical Strong type of villain either.
user2: Haha yeah .I didn't like the villain too much though. He was too underplayed.
user2: I didn't really read the comics, but was Wonder Woman always the daughter of Zeus? Or was that unique only to the film universe?
user1: the notes say that she is the half sibling of Ares and daughter of Hippolyta and Zues.. i do not remember that being in the tv show, but i did not read the comics either.  
user1: I only remember she was an Amazonian.
user2: Yeah that's what I thought too. I guess it doesn't really matter about her origins too much
user2: but what I didn't like was how Ares still held onto his British appearance and accent even after revealing himself to be Ares. That really took me out of the movie.
user1: With a lot of these genres, i find it is easier to separate film from comic and TV. there are too many differences to know what is conon sometimes.
user2: That's true.
user1: I kind of liked it... making it how even a God could be an everyman.   but i see your point.  he was almost "too" normal when fighting her.
user2: Another thing that I didn't understand was why they initially refused to train Diana when everyone knew that she was the daughter of Zeus and literally the only person on earth who could stop Ares.
user2: On an island full of fierce warrior culture, why would they not want to utilize the best weapon they have against their fight to keep earth safe?
user1: i was frustrated with Hippolyta's refusal for Antiope to train her/... i mean, you are a warrior race of badass women. teach the daughter of zeus to protect herself because you KNOW something is goig to happen some day. it just HAS to. it always does. lol
user1: and my typing just went haywire. sorry about that
user2: Haha no worries. And yeah seriously!
user1: especially when on a "hidden" island with only fog to really hid you?
user1: like someone, some day isn't going to go in there... and does.
user2: You know another thing I kind of didn't understand? On an island full of women, did they just start out with a set number that kept dwindling down as amazon warriors died off? Or was there some way that they were able to keep their population growing or at least stable?
user1: i think they age more slowly..... if they don't all have gods blood in them they have something
user1: demigods maybe?
user2: Hah makes sense. So if Ares main goal is to cause the destruction of human life, why doesn't he just use his powers to kill everyone himself? Seems like no modern technology at that time posed a threat to him.
user1: never really thought about it.
user2: Ares could single handedly wipe out everyone by himself if he wanted.
user1: because ares is the god of war. but he does not start it himself
user1: he manipulates man to start it amongst themselves
user1: kind of like loki is trickery and manipulates .. ares seems much the same way.
user1: the sheet says "although he hassubtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in theprocess, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt."
user2: Just seems really inefficient considering the abilities that Ares already has haha
user1: i agree. but every depiction i have ever seen of ares is the same way... even in Xena.. lol
user2: That's true. Oh man Xena brings back memories.
user2: I would much rather see a Xena movie than a DC movie LOL
user1: i would totally watch Xena if it was on Netflix
user1: before any DC movie
user2: Heck yeah! Wait, was Xena also a Amazon princess of some kind or was she just a warrior princess?
user2: I forget... been so long....
user1: just Warrior Princess... there was episode where it was thought that Ares was her father, but it was never proven
user1: Xena and Hercules. now that brings me back to my teenage years. 
user1: so much better than the current batman and superman combined
user1: wonder woman could fit in with them though.
user2: True that! By the way, didn't Steve's decision to sacrifice himself by flying that plane at the end of Wonder Woman totally remind you of Steve's decision to sacrifice himself by flying that plane at the end of Captain America?
user1: she had the body and accent. lol
user2: Yeah I agree.
user1: Chris Pine... Chris Evans.... lets throw Chris Pratt into it too and Star Lords decision to sacrifice himself by throwing himself into space to save Gamora....it's all the same hero gimmick.
user2: Seriously... these writers have got to come up with some original ideas for a change....
user1: Yes!
user1: How long were we supposed to chat in here?
user2: I don't know. But we should have seen the 4th paragraph by now but it's still not showing...
user1: it has been 33 minutes and the document says "Wonder WomanThis is the end of document." at the top
user1: i think we can probably finish now
user2: I think so too.Well it's been a pleasure chatting with you.
user1: you too. maybe they will make a Xena movie
user2: Fingers crossed! =)

conversation:
user2: Hello! 
user1: hey
user1: hello?
user1: Is anyone there?

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hey, have you seen Wonder Woman?
user2: Are you there?
user1: no
user1: male
user2: Are you a fan of Super Hero movies?
user1: yes
user1: super man
user2: I think you will really like this movie. Wonder Woman appeared following the Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice movie. The actress is Gal Gadot. Are you familiar with her?
user1: yes
user2: Oh nice, well in this film, she plays as Diana Prince. She's an Amazon warrior who leaves her homeland to help fight during World War I
user1:  She's an Amazon warrior who leaves her homeland to help fight during World War
user2: Yes :)
user1: yes
user2: It's cool because it has a whole demi-god twist as Wonder Woman has to fight Ares in the setting of WWI
user1: t's cool because it has a whole demi-god twist as Wonder Woman has to fight Ares in the setting of WWI
user2: Are you just copying me lol
user1: yes i like it

conversation:
user2: Okay, sounds like a good movie
user1: Hi! I never knew that Wonder Woman told the story of Princess Diana that grew up on the Amazon island of Themyscira
user1: I really like movies where Patty Jenkins is the director. How about you?
user2: yeah, and I knew she was sort of special, but not that she was related to ares, makes sense for a warrior
user2: Not sure I know her other movies. But she seems good
user1: I just never thought of Wonder Woman as a war movie
user2: Nor me, but set in WWII, I guess it is here. Usually it's more regular super hero stuff for wonder woman I thought
user1: I agree, more like a Superman, Batman type of movie. I may just have to watch this movie.
user2: Yeah. I want to see it. Sounds exciting with good action
user1: I agree
user2: I don't know if I've seen Gal Gadot in anything else, but sounds like she does a good job here
user1: Yes it does! I think it is neat that the American pilot that crashes is rescued by her.
user2: Yeah. Nice to see a woman doing the rescuing
user1: Its nice to see a movie that is not about blood and guts. This sounds  like a good clean movie
user2: Have you see the the Batman v superman movie that's mentioned?
user1: No I have not, but it sure does sound like a good movie too
user2: Yeah, 
user1: I think it is crazy that she was trained to be a warrior and especially to be trained by her sister
user2: Well, I guess if your half brother is the god of war, you're pretty much required to be a warrior
user1: Ha! I guess so!  That is a good point! The rating on this movie is a little above normal. I wish it was a little higher like maybe an 8
user2: It got pretty good reveiws though, I don't know if you get many rated 8 or higher
user1: I did not realize that this was a second live action theatrical film. Did you?
user2: No.  I didn't realize wonder woman was in the another marvel film
user1: I hope Patty Jenkins gets to play more war movies.
user2: Ah, so Ares was responsible for ww2, sounds like a fun mix
user1: it sounds like it wil be action packed for sure
user2: guess it's ww1? and the baddies sound pretty typical, trying to make really bad weapons
user1: yes it does. 

conversation:
user2: What was the name of the woman who played Wonder Woman?
user1: Gal Gadot
user1: As diana prince
user1: Fun fact she also was in the isrealian army
user1: Did really good on the reviews
user1: rotten tomatoes scored a 92
user1: have you seen it?
user2: That's right!  A woman directed it too.
user2: A 92?  Surprised it wasn't higher...I've seen it 4 or 5 times.
user1: wow
user1: I think the great cast it had helped that a lot
user2: I always get the "Chris" actors mixed up...which Chris has the male lead?
user1: chris pine?
user1: one who played in star trek
user1: another good actor
user2: That's him.  The love interest.
user1: ha
user2: Didn't Batman send her the photograph plate?
user1: I mean you seen the movie 5 times do i really need to go over the synopis?
user1: yes
user1: I never watched the new one
user1: justic league
user2: Not a fan of the actor who played Ares.
user1: were you surpised by the ending?
user1: I like the actor,, but playing that part didn't fit him
user1: wrong role for him
user2: That's what I meant.  Yeah, that ended the love interest part right there and then.
user2: Was Wonder Woman in Batman vs Superman?
user1: yeah briefly
user2: They said it was her 2nd appearance but I don't remember her.  Heck, I don't even remember Superman dying.
user1: Superman died at the end by that big blob
user1: well technically he can't die
user1: but you get the point
user2: How would you feel if your brother or sister trained your child to fight Gods against your wishes?
user2: Sir Patrick was that guys name.
user1: I mean she was meant to fight
user1: That was fear holding her mom back
user1: Ye sir patrick
user2: The death of the Chris Pine character is what saved us all in the end...from the bomb and from ourselves.
user1: yeah kinda ruined it for me
user2: Diana realized humans have good in them and that led to the big finish.
user1: Yup 
user1: well good day
user2: Same.  New one coming out soon.
user2: Come back!  I don't think we're done!  I was surprised Sir Patrick was the bad guy and it wasn't Ludendorf.

user2: it a dc concept
user1: yep

user1: and the lasso of truth
user1: the story of the "Godkiller" sword was cool- when Diana was young
user2: is this type of real story
user1: no

user2: u 2

conversation:
user2: hello!
user1: Greetings!
user1: So, what's this movie all about?
user2: Im not 100% because I have never seen it. But from the document I see on the left it looks like its about a super woman
user2: her name is wonder woman
user1: Ah, who stars in that again? I forget her name.
user2: Gal Gadot is the star of the movie and she plays Diana Prince also known as wonder woman in the movie
user1: Ah, she is absolutely stunning. A wonderful actress. And then there's that guy from Star Trek in it, right?
user2: not that I believe 
user2: have you ever seen the movie?
user1: I've wanted to see it.
user1: Who is it directed by?

conversation:
user1: I thought the cast was great!
user2: Gal Gadot was just incredible! And I normally love Chris Pine in anything.
user1: I agree. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine had AMAZING chemistry
user1: Haven't seen any of Patty Jenkins previous films, but I would be interested after seeing this.
user2: That was really important that they have good chemistry. The whole movie pivoted around Steve drawing Diana out into man's world and guiding her through it.
user2: Yes her direction was just wonderful. It was so intensely empowering to see her use love and peace so formidably and through a female super hero finally.
user1: She did seem like the perfect director to take on a strong female super hero film.
user2: I haven't seen her previous films, but I'm definitely on board after this piece.
user1: Great to finally see a DC film score big with critics and fans.
user1: I also thought the action scenes were top notch.
user2: And finally a female superhero lead. Marvel hasn't given us that yet.
user1: Let's hope DC continues the trend! Great seeing something different for once.
user2: Amazing too how they managed to include all these Greek myth elements without getting too cheesy.
user1: I was surprised they kept it to mostly just montages of the Amazon mythology
user2: Plus using the entire island of Themyscira. The whole background somehow didn't seem ridiculous, even though it should have.
user1: Yes, I thought the Amazon tribe was very interesting. Good use of cgi
user2: It was super empowering to see all these woman in such a thriving and powerful society. Robin Wright was wildly inspiring.
user1: I was worried after Batman vs. Superman, but this movie proved me wrong with it's strong cast and storytelling 
user2: I was worried too. I really enjoyed setting it in WWI, and keeping it from being too gritty.
user1: The great score helped a lot as well
user1: Good pacing also, didn't feel like it dragged
user2: The two villains on top of the natural progression of World War I kept it really fresh. General Erich Ludendorff going rogue made it just a storm of problems to address. It was intense.
user1: I agree, intense is a good word. Especially the battles.
user2: The battles were incredible. I was shocked over how on the edge of my seat I was for the German beach invasion of Themyscira
user1: The special effects really mad them even more memorable. I liked the mix of practical and cgi.
user2: The special effects in the fight between Ares and DIana were incredible in the final fight.
user1: Oh yes, the climactic showdown between Wonder Woman and Ares was great!
user2: I was really upset when Steve sacrificed himself. I really wanted them to continue, because I enjoyed their dynamic so much!
user1: I can totally understand that haha
user2: I loved the character before the movie, so really the whole thing was just a wonderful ride for me.
user1: Agreed. Nice chat. Goodbye!
user2: Thanks! It was nice!

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello!!
user1: Have you ever seen Wonder Woman the movie?
user2: I have not yet, have you?
user1: Yeah, it was a pretty awesome movie!
user2: Is it the one from 2017?
user1: The 2015 one, the film tells the story of Princess Diana who grows up on the islad of Themyscira.
user2: Oh I don't know if I ever heard of that one. Is it that one where Diana is a zombie?
user1: Yeah, I think so.
user1: There is a pilot that crashes a plane on the island and Diana rescued him.
user2: Diana is such a sweet heart. Does it have a happy ending?
user1: He tells her about the world war and she leaves her home to try to end the conflict.
user2: This is Diana, the Princess of Wales we are talking about, right?
user1: Wonder woman--an imortal amazon warriror who is crowned princess of themyscira. Her real name is Diana
user2: Does immortal mean she can't eat pie?
user1: They set this one during world warI so it's like wonder woman is a war movie. 
user1: Hmm, good question! lol
user2: War, war never changes, how many pies are in the movie?
user1: 0
user1: it was thrilling!
user2: Darn, I sure do like pies. Maybe I will watch it. Can I rent it at Blockbuster?
user1: She wasn't meant to stop the war, but to love to fight the war. 
user1: I'm not sure. We haven't had a Blockbuster here in years
user2: Oh sorry, I've been in a coma for some time. So she's a fighter, not a lover?
user1: It's a great movie. Wonder Womans sister trains her for the war
user2: What did Diana do before she was trained to fight? please say bake pies...
user1: She arms herself with the godkiller sword and her armor before leaving with steve (the piolet) to go find and destroy Ares. 
user2: Is this movie available in 4D?
user1: Doubtful!
user2: Good, those make my nose hurt.
user1: She winds up sparing Maru and kills him. 
user2: How tall is Maru? 
user1: Then she is reaffirmed into her new mission to fight on the world's behalf
user2: Do you like pie?
user1: She is average size
user2: so 3ft tall?
user1: I love like chocolate silk pie. 
user1: Something like that! 
user2: Do you want to watch this movie with me, and eat pie?
user1: Thanks for chatting with me. I'm going to end the conversation 
user2: lol ok
user1: Maybe! hit me up if your ever in IN =)

conversation:
user1: I can't believe it's been so long since Wonder Woman came out! have you seen the movie?
user1: I think Gal Gadot is beautiful and strong, and it's worth seeing the movie just for her performance!
user2: No, I haven't seen it yet but I have been interested in giving it a try
user1: It's apparently a spin from her appearance in 2016's Batman v Superman
user2: So I'll probably need to watch Batman v Superman first then
user2: Does the movie have a good plot?
user2: Would it be something intended for children?
user1: IT seems interesting. It's about a princess (wonder woman) living int he Amazon who saves Steve Trevor (an american)
user1: It's set in WW1 which is interesting too.
user1: I think it may be a little violent for children.
user1: Did you know that it's the first super hero movie to be directed by a woman?
user2: No I didn't
user1: Yes. It was directed by Patty Jenkins
user2: Well I think that would make it even better
user1: Definitely! 
user2: About how long does the movie last?
user1: IT got great reviews too. 92% on Rotten Tomatoes
user1: I'm not sure how long the movie is. The plot seems a little complex though so it probably isn't short
user1: It also has some allusions to Greek Mythology (Zeus) 
user2: I'll have to check the critics then, I always like to check comments before viewing a movie
user1: Me too. Metacritic has it at 76/100
user1: and CinemaScore is A
user2: I love a movie with greek mythology
user2: Are there any other well known actors that play in it
user1: Chris Pine is the male protaganist. He is the American solider rescued by Wonder Woman in the beginning
user1: And Robin Wright plays Antiope, another Greek mythology character
user2: So it seems to be a lot of women in this one. 
user2: i think that would make for a great spin off to show the strong women super heroes
user1: Definitely. It looks like the Greek God Ares is the villan  
user1: He apparently wants to destroy mankind and tries to recruit Wonder Woman to help him do it
user1: Because he wants things to go back to "paradise"
user2: so do you believer this movie will keep me entertained all the way through
user1: I think so. There's definitely a lot going on. And it seems like there are some pretty epic battle scenes which are always cool.
user1: Wonder Woman at some point has a weapon called a "Godkiller" sword lol
user2: it's not too much going on is it? movies that jump around too much tend to make me lose interest
user1: It doesn't seem like TOO much. Just enough to keep you engaged. There's even a reference to Bruce Wayne near the end
user2: So you think its going to lead up to another story line? maybe another sequel
user1: Oh definitely. Apparently she is thanking him via email for a gift he sent her, and reaffirming her mission to fight for the world.

conversation:
user1: Do you like superhero movies, you should watch Wonder Woman. 
user2: I actually love superhero movies. Are you talking about the new Wonder Woman movie?
user1: Yes, the one with Gal Gadot. Patty Jenkins did great as director. 
user2: Really? What is about other than Wonder Woman?
user1: I'm not sure. I really liked Diana's action scenes and how she used love to fight war. 
user2: Wait, who is Diana?
user1: Diana Prince is Wonder Woman. I really liked the scenes on her home islanad of Themyscria. 
user2: What is her home island like?
user1: It is a hidden island, home to the Amazononinwarrior 
user2: Also, since this is a superhero movie who is the main villain in the movie?
user1: Ares became jealous of humanity and wants to kill all of mankind. 
user2: Where is Ares from?
user1: I'm not sure. Do you like these kinds of movies? I especially enjoyed the scenes between Steve and Diana, like when she used the Lasso of Hestia. 
user2: I do like these types of movies, but who is Steve?
user1: Did you watch this movie? Steve is the American Pilot that crashed on Diana's island. 
user2: No I didn't
user2: i am trying to decide if I want to watch it.
user2: This movie seems to have a lot going on, how long is it?
user1: I can't remember. It is pretty straight forward. Diana took the Godkiller sword to defeat Ares, that was fun. 
user2: Sounds like there is plenty of action in this movie. Are there any cameos from other superheros?
user1: Well the movie is mostly about Diana versus Ares. That battle was intense. The scene with Steve saving the world was sad too. 
user2: How does Steve save the world?
user1: He takes a plane full of gas into high altitude so that it detonates without killing people, sacrificing himself. 
user2: What's the relationship between Steve and Wonder Woman?
user1: His death gave her a lot of grief and caused her to use her rage on Ares. She saw good in him. Obviously she liked him a lot. 
user2: I was wondering if it was romantic or not
user1: This movie is more about the story of Wonder Woman. 

conversation:
user2: Hey, how's it going?
user1: Hey, I'm good
user1: You?
user2: I am great. Thanks for asking.
user2: I wanted you to share some information with me about the movie
user1: So this task asks us to talk about a movie. Have you seen Wonder Woman?
user2: No I haven't.
user2: Give me some info. I'm trying to decide if I want to watch it.
user1: Want to share why not? There were a lot of commercials about it.
user2: I havent
user2:  I habent
user2:  I haven't seen the commercials
user2: Sorry, my typing is a bit off. lol
user1: Ahh got it. No worries lol. Well, it stars Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. And it also has Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Danny Huston.
user1: You probably don't know everyone on that list but Gadot and Pine are pretty famous
user2: Oh okay. I don't think I've heard about these actors and actresses. 
user2: Did you like it?
user2: Would you recommend I see this movie with kids? 
user1: The movie is basically her origin story as to how she grew up in Amazonia (island blocked off from all radar) and then left to the real world with a soldier to rid it of evil. Her ancestory spoke of a evil being that she thinks came alive again to start the new world war. 
user2: Sounds pretty interesting I'd say
user1: Yeah, I thought it was the best movie DC made thus far. And definitely watch with the kids. It shows that women can be just as strong and fierce as men. Sends a great message and has a lot of action. 
user2: Cool. I might plan that to be the next outing then. 
user1: Marvel (Avengers and Iron Man and stuff) have made a ton but DC hasn't made a lot of good movies. This is one of the better ones lol. 
user1: I don't think its in the theater anymore. Look into grabbing a DVD
user2: Oh okay. I thought it was something new, shows how much I go out to theaters or know whats going on in it.
user2: But anyway, I may look into renting this movie
user2: Story line seems like it will keep my attention.
user1: Haha no biggie. There are more important things in live
user1: life*
user2: Yes
user1: Definitely will. 
user1: Don;t know if you know rating services but Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 7.6/10
user1: Which is a seriously good score these days
user1: Metacritic give it a 76/100 and it got an A by Cinemascore
user2: Oh great. Sounds like a must see.
user2: Do you think all the people in the cast worked well together?
user2: worked*
user1: I think they did alright. They definitely did a good job of casting for each individual role but I guess their work together as a gorup could have been better.
user1: Have you seen other superhero movies?
user2: Oh okay. I've seen Superman...
user2: But great chatting with ya...
user1: Lol well, the CGI is horrible. Only downside
user1: You too!

conversation:
user1: I like the movie, pretty good plot 
user1: Superhero movies are my favorite, what about you?
user2: I am okay. My grand kids like to watch them so I watch with them.
user1: My husband got me stuck to them.
user2: So, any particular movie do you like?
user1: I like the Batman, all of them. How about you?
user2: We like Wonder Woman.  I have three grand daughters.
user1: Awww, I like Wonder Woman too. 
user2: I like to watch superhero movies.  I do not want to take life too seriously.
user1: I know what you mean, if you do you'll just end up getting hurt in the long run. It takes your mid off of everyday things too.
user2: Totally agree.
user1: Do you and your grand daughters watch any other super hero movies?
user2: We watched Batman movie in the past.
user1: I think that Rotten Tomatoes gave Wonder Woman a great review
user2: Yes.  I will watch it again.
user1: So will I, I will probably watch it with my niece and nephews next time.
user2: Boys will like it too.  When they are small they are less biased.
user1: Very true, it's when they grow up that you have to worry about.
user2: Do you watch movies at home?
user1: Yes, I would rather watch them at because it cost too much to go to the theater anymore.
user2: I used to like to go to movie theaters.  However, with various news about shootings, I decide not to.
user1: I don't blame you there, you can't trust anyone. Also sad that you can't go out and have fun with the grand kids without watching over your shoulder.
user2: I only bring one or two kids out.  I do not trust strangers anymore.  
user1: I don't blame you, this world is becoming a scary place. One reason why I choose not to have kids.
user2: Are things getting bad or are they same but we know more due to the internet?
user1: Very true. They never tell anything good that is going on, only the bad things.
user2: It says that we must reply 12X but the finish conversation is still grayed out even though I already did 12.
user1: I have no idea.
user1: I never did this type of survey before.
user2: Is your button still inactive?
user1: I can finish now.
user2: Mine is active now.  Thank you!
user2: Bye

conversation:
user1: The movie is "Wonder Woman".  based on the character from the DC comics.
user2: Hi - I was not given the name of the movie- do you know the name?
user2: Oh there it is, never mind.
user1: So, she is an immortal Amazon warrior..
user2: LOL....many so!
user1: The movie itself is a war movie and is set during WWI.
user2: Have you seen Wonder woman?
user2: Oh I see, that sounds pretty serious.
user1: I haven't, but by the looks of this paragragh, it sounds great!
user1: Apparently, it isn't as dark as it sounds and is brighter than the regular style of DC movies.
user2: I have seen my share of war movies....not my favorite by any means, but it is interesting to learn about history.
user1: So, apparently, it is set in Paris.
user1: or starts with a setting in Paris.
user1: Where Diana receives a plate with a photograph of herself and four men.  The photo having been taken during WWI.
user2: Ahh, I like Paris - been there several times - perfect setting for a movie consedering the historical buildings of Paris.
user1: Agreed!  Who wouldn't love Paris!!  So, the plate forces her to recall her past.
user2: Definitely sounds like an interesting movie - I will need to check it out.
user1: And apparently, Dianna was born on a hidden island, the daughter of a Queen and raised on this hidden island inhabited by the Amazonian warrior women,
user1: Also, it seems the movie itself will include much of the history, mythology and gods and goddesses and such.
user2: Really....? That explains the title.
user1: Exactly.
user1: so originally, Dianna is forbidden to train as a warrior
user1: She eventually convinces her mother to allow her sister to train her.  
user2: I see, I wonder why....diffirent time I suppose.
user1: Later, as a young woman, she rescues an American pilot after his plane crashes.
user2: Clever girl - good for her!
user1: right!
user1: So, soon following, as would be expected, the island is invaded by bad guys looking for the pilot.
user2: Well - she certainly lives up to her Wonder Woman title.
user1: She definitely does!!
user1: But, we wouldn't have expected anything different from Wonder Woman, right?
user2: Are you sure you haven't seen this movie - you sure know a lot about it:)
user2: True - Wonder Woman has a reputation to maintain.
user1: HA!  Well, I haven't.  
user1: And I'm definitely trying to avoid too many spoilers from these paragraphs!
user1: Both for myself and for you!
user2: Smile .....I appreciate that.
user1: So, it sounds like there are great battle scenes and heroic action scenes!
user1: Probably TONS of beautiful Amazon women!
user2: Absolutely - definitely a movie with loads of action. 
user1: Not to mention, it received a 92% : 7.6/10 from Rotten tomatoes 
user1: And a Cinema Score of "A"
user2: Is that right.....makes sense just from the description alone. 
user1: I thought so too!
user1: So, I didn't realize this movie has been out since 2015.
user2: Who plays Wonder Woman - do you know?
user1: Gal Gadot
user2: Hahaha.....seriously 2015?? OMG, I don't go to the movies much, nor keep up with the latest.
user1: Apparently, I don't either. Interestingly enough, it falls in the "Drama" genre...  I would have called it an "Action" from the description.
user2: But, I think I will rent this movie - sounds like it will be time well spend.
user1: I agree!  
user1: I'm going to do the same!
user1: Who wouldn't love a movie about a demi-god using love to fight war!  
user2: They should make another category that includes both Drama and Action.
user1: Agreed!  Should be called Action Filled Drama!

conversation:
user1: Hi
user1: What movie did you watch?
user2: The movie is Wonder Woman
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: Oh, what did you like about it?
user1: No, but i've heard a lot about it.
user1: I would like to see it
user2: Since I can only go off the document: I like that it had a female director. I like Wonder Woman as a character as well.
user2: Do you like superhero movies?
user1: I love superhero movies. Could you tell there was a green screen?
user1: Great to see females portrayed on the big screen
user2: I am not sure. Do you care about rotten tomatoes or metacritic scores?
user2: I agree
user1: What are the rotten tomato scores like for Wonder Woman?
user2: It was 92%, fairly high.
user1: That's impressive. How about metacritic?
user2: 76/100
user1: Good to know. Do you know how much Wonder Woman scored at the box office opening night?
user2: I'm not sure. There is this interesting scene where Diana takes a picture of herself with the other main characters. I liked that scene because it made the ending more emotional
user1: Adding emotion for the audience is a good way to gain viewers, too.
user1: Do you expect a part 2?
user2: I don't really know but I sure hope so. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were excellent as the leads
user1: Oh Chris Pine is a great actor, I hope there will be a second one too!
user2: I like how Diana was interested in Chris Pine's character but it wasn't the main point of the story, instead it was just a factor that made it more interesting
user2: Did you know Sir Patrick was in the movie as the villain?
user1: That sounds cool, adds more depth to the movie. I don't like when superhero moves are all about romance. it takes away from things
user1: I didn't know that! 
user2: I agree!
user1: Sounds like a great cast, i'd love to see the movie
user2: Yes, the way they revealed him to be the villain was surprising and caught me off guard.
user2: You should see it for sure!
user1: I am surprised too. I think i'm going to take my friend to see Wonder Woman!
user2: That's great! You will all definitely enjoy it.
user1: Thanks for all the details :)
user2: No problem. Thanks for listening!

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hi
user2: So it looks like Wonder Woman scored well on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Seems to have some positive reviews also
user2: Yes.  I seem to agree with the reviews about the action being thrilling and precise. 
user1: And it has the first female director of a live-action comic book hero movie
user2: Thats awesome.  Looks like Patty Jenkins is getting a lot of praise for her directing of this film
user1: And a second for Wonder Woman herself
user2: How did you like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
user1: I think we have to discuss based on the info in the document only. Perhaps this is outside the scope?
user1: What did you think of the plot of the story?
user2: eh.  Says imagine you just watched the movie.  Gal Gadot is listed in the cast.  Think it should be alright.
user2: I liked the plot.  The world war 1 setting worked well for the film.
user1: I would agree that Gal Gadot was an "inspired choice" as one of the reviewers said.
user2: I also liked the supporting role of Chris Pine and Danny Huston.  Thought they were great casting choices.
user1: I agree. Seems like a remote place in the story plot if they have to be told of the ongoing World War
user2: Ya.  I was aware of Wonder Woman before the film, but learned a lot about her backstory after watching the movie.
user2: I was unaware of her relation to Zeus.
user1: And that she currently lives in Paris - seems this movie happens in flashback to her past
user2: That was much needed.  It says Wonder Woman made her debut in 2016 Batman v. Superman but only had a small role.
user1: Looking at the story plot and the complex relationships that they want you to keep track of it seems like they are setting up for sequel that they want you to come back for.
user2: I'm sure.  DC needs to make more movies like Wonder Woman to gain more popularity.
user1: I'll bet Diana and Steve fall for each other there - seems almost deliberate that they didn't have that this time.
user2: Maybe not :)  I forgot that Steve sacrificed himself in the plan with the gas.
user2: plane*
user1: The time-span seems huge. She rescues him in World War 1 (1918). And then they say present-day Paris (almost 100 years later?) and she is now emailing too.
user2: Ya, its nice that she's a God and lives for a long time.  Can work with many different time frames.
user2: I hope that Patty Jenkins directs the next film as well
user1: True but is she supposed to have lost her divine powers? The beginning and end are very human.
user1: I hope so too. 
user2: It will be interesting to see where the sequel goes especially since Justice League just came out not too long ago.
user1: Let's wait and see

conversation:
user2: Good morning!
user1: SO what did you think of the movie?  I thought it was pretty cool that they started it during World War 1.
user2: I have not seen Wonder Woman yet, I am typically not a fan of superhero films. But the story does look very interesting.
user1: It's supposed to be very good.  Gal Godot did a great job, and the critics are giving it great reviews.
user2: It does have solid reviews, from what I did see.
user1: I didn't like how the other DC movies were so dark and grim.  Wonder Woman did a good job staying truer to how the comics started.
user2: Which DC movies have a dark and grim tone?
user1: Pretty much all of the other movies based on the DC universe.
user2: I see. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is good to see that this movie took a different angle.
user1: Yeah.  It was alot more fun than the others.  Not so serious, but with a lot of action.
user2: It is a war movie, but it is not serious? Sounds sort of contradictory, do you agree?
user1: Sort of.  It's not exactly a war movie, it's a comic book story thats set mostly in the time of World War 1.
user2: oh, that makes much more sense then. Sorry for the confusion.
user1: No problem.  The part during World War 1 is only part of the story.  It then fast forwards to present day times
user2: Sort of a flash back thing, I understand.
user1: well, kind of.  The movie starts on the amazon island where Wonder Woman lives.  AN airplane crashes, and the pilot tells her about the war that's raging around the world.  She leaves the island to stop the war, but then I guess she never goes home because the amazons send someone to teach her all about the amazonian history 60 years later in Paris.
user2: She probably got hooked up with the pilot... Know what I mean?
user1: Probably.  Everyone's calling him her love interest.  He's probably the first man she's ever seen, since she lived on an Amazon island
user2: You are absolutely right.
user1: I liked the fact that they included her magic lasso in the movie.  That was always an important part of Wonder WOman's character
user2: I remember that from the old TV show with Lynda Carter. I probably just showed my age a little... :)
user1: Yeah, maybe a little.  BUt I think Gal Godot did a great job in the movie, and I was thrilled to see Robin Wright had a large part too.
user2: Wright is a solid actress, in everything I see her in, I am impressed.
user1: It's sad that both her character and Steve Trevor died in the movie.  Rather emotional.
user2: Well, those kinds of deaths in the movie are designed to be impactful; so, in a way, they succeeded.
user1: yeah.  They did a good job driving the plot forward, giving WOnder Woman reason to do what she did.  She left the island, and she spared humanity because she had found good in STeve.
user2: She was inspired by his actions, yes?
user1: yes.  And her love for him too, I bet.  He sacrificed himself to save everyone else.
user2: Makes total sense to me.

user2: PLEASE TALK ABOUT WONDER WOMEN MOVIE..OTHERWISE OUT HAS REJECTED 
user1:  she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior.
user2: Before she was Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise
user2: HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE
user1: VERY MUCH
user2: WHEN  YOU SEE THIS MOVIE
user1: YES SURE I CAN SEE THIS MOVIE
user2: OK PLICE EXPLINE
user1: When I visited the set of Wonder Woman, I noted that I had two major concerns about the film. I didn’t go into them because they could be considered spoilers, but since the film has been released, I’ll go into what they are. The first is the way the movie begins. The movie essentially has three prologues: Diana at the Louvre, Diana as a child, and the story of how the Amazonians came to be. It’s all necessary exposition, and director Patty Jenkins handles it wonderfully. The movie never feels like it’s dragging, and you become more invested in Diana’s world the more you learn.My other concern was Ares. While on the edit bay visit we were told that David Thewlis was playing a British politician named Sir Patrick Morgan, word had leaked that he was actually Ares. I was worried that this was an unnecessary twist since Morgan’s job—advocating for the armistice—would seem to be at cross-purposes with Ares’ true goal, which is perpetual war.
user2: OK
user2: When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, Diana, an Amazonian warrior in training, leaves home to fight a war, discovering her full powers and true destiny.
user1: OK
user1: TELL ABOUT THE STORY MODULATION
user2: Wonder Woman is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Patty Jenkins, with a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, and stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. Wonder Woman is the second live action theatrical film featuring the titular character, following her debut in 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[5] Jenkins's role as director makes her the first female director of a live-action, theatrically released comic book superhero film.[6] The film tells the story of Diana Prince, who grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira. After American pilot Steve Trevor (Pine) crashes offshore of the island and is rescued by her, he tells the Amazons about the ongoing World War. Diana then leaves her home in order to end the conflict.While development for the film began in 1996, Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before wrapping up on May 9, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of the birth of the creator, William Moulton Marston. Additional filming took place in November 2016.Wonder Woman premiered in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. It received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for its performances (particularly those of Gadot and Pine), direction, action sequences, and musical score.[7] The film set numerous box office records;[8] it is the fifth-highest-grossing superhero film domestically and 20th-highest-grossing film in the United States. It grossed over $821 million worldwide, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 2017. It also helped the DCEU to push past $3 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the fourteenth-highest-grossing film franchise of all time. As of October 2017, Rotten Tomatoes has listed the movie as No. 1 on its list of the "50 Best Superhero Movies of All Time",[9][note 1] and the American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 Movies of the Year.[10] The film received three nominations at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, winning Best Action Movie. A sequel is set to be released on November 1, 2019 with Jenkins and Gadot reprising their roles as director and lead role respectively

conversation:
user2: good movie
user1: Really?
user1: What was the name of the movie?

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hi! The movie is Wonder Woman!
user1: OK, yes I watched that opening weekend.
user2: I still haven't seen it haha. 
user2: But I love Gal Gadot!
user1: Yeah, she was a different kind of wonder woman from the original TV show.
user2: I heard the original made a cameo, but I could be wrong
user1: I wasn't expecting a foreign accent. I honestly don't remember if she made an appearance.
user1: If she did, it was a small cameo I guess.
user2: She's from Israel!
user1: Wasn't expecting the movie to go into Greek Mythology too.. kinda cool to tie that in with the DC universe
user2: Yeah I can't wait to watch it when I have a spare few hours LOL. 
user2: It was given a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which I guess is good
user1: Overall it was well received, and critics thought it was better than the other DC movies.
user1: I tend to disagree though and liked Man of Steel and Justice League.
user2: Yeah it looks really good, possibly better than Man of Steel.
user1: Wonder woman takes place way in the past and im not a big fan of movies from that setting.
user1: But the whole movie isnt in that time, so I guess that helped.
user2: yeah that's what I'm reading lol. I prefer present day, also
user1: Plus the casting for the villian was god awful.. felt like a joke really 
user2: But Chris Pine, though. 
user1: People in the theater (including myself) laughed when we saw some parts that probably weren't mean to be funny.
user2: I'll have to grab my popcorn and Reeses before I watch it. I tend to laugh at stuff that shouldn't be laughed at, also 
user1: Oh yeah you'll get a kick out of some things then.. im like, is this even trying to be a serious movie?
user2: Are you into other super hero movies in the DC universe?
user1: Yeah, I've seen them all so far I believe.
user1: You?
user2: Yeah a few. I'm not so keen on Batman. 
user1: Yeah, I have mixed feelings about that too. 
user1: I don't think that they should have even made a Batman v Superman movie. Honestly, Batman shouldn't even have had a chance
user2: But Wonder Woman seems like a really good movie, it's just hard to watch it when I have a 3 year old running around
user1: Oh yeah, I know all about the sacrifices made for our kids!
user2: Do you watch movies even if they get a bad review?
user1: Fortunatly, my parents are involved in my little girl's lives and relish the opportunity to spend time with them.
user1: Yeah, definitely. If I liked the preview to something, I'll go see it regardless of how it was reviewed.
user1: I just care about the reviews on movies that I was on the fence about.
user2: My husband will too. He doesn't care
user1: OK Well I think I'll wrap things up here.. was nice talking to you!

conversation:
user1: Hey there!  What did you think of Wonder Woman?
user2: I thought it was great! it was amazing getting to see WW in the big screen after all this time
user1: Agreed.  I really enjoyed how they made a great backstory out of it.
user2: Right? And Steve Trevor was hilarious in the film.
user1: I thought Chris Pine played him well, about as good as could be expected.
user2: Definitely. I also think that his assistant in the film was played well.
user1: I was excited to see that Patty Jenkins, the director, won accolades as many female directors don't get the credit they deserve.
user2: Yes, I thought she did a marvelous job, and also I'm happy that she's getting more opportunities to showcase her directing skills.
user1: What did you think of the special effects?
user2: They were ok. On some occasions you could clearly see that they weren't very well done.
user1: Yeah, I did observe that especially in the finale at the airbase.
user2: What did you think about the plot twist regarding Ares?
user1: Loved it.  I didn't suspect a thing!
user2: It was great! I thought that his outfit looked identical to the comic book counterpart.
user1: They did a good job of masking the secret especially because the Germans were so mean in the movie.
user2: Yes! I was surprised when I learned that the main villain of almost the entire film was based on a real life character.
user1: The only part of the movie I would have changed would have been to focus a bit more when she was a child.
user2: I would've loved to have seen more of Robin Wright training her as a child.
user1: Agreed, key part of the movie that could have been improved.
user2: Where you doubtful at the beginning before watching the movie?
user1: Very much, but the good reviews pushed me forward.
user2: I can't wait for the sequel!
user1: Me as well, should be exciting!
user2: I also heard that Chris Pine is returning, so that should be interesting.
user1: Agreed, will be a step in the right direction.
user2: It's also fantastic that the film sorta leads into Justice League in the beggining.
user1: Since they want to complete that whole story arc, made total sense to me.
user2: Yeah, and that "cameo" by Bruce Wayne was pretty exciting as well.

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hi
user1: So, what genre is the movie?
user2: Have you watched the movie directed by Patty Jenkins
user2: It's Marvel Superhero
user2: based movie
user1: Never heard of her
user1: Oh, is it Spiderman?
user2: The main character is a women
user2: woman*
user2: I apologize it is DC Comics
user2: not Marvel
user2: Chris Pine and Gal Gadot acted in this movie
user2: Wonder Woman, it is. Have you watched it?
user1: Oh, Wonder Woman. 
user2: Yes
user1: No, never seen it
user1: I saw the Justice League though so I know of her
user2: You must watch it if you like superhero movies
user2: You will love it. 
user1: Who does Chris Pine play?
user2: Steve Trevor
user2: Steve Trevor, an American Pilot and love interest of Diana
user1: Interesting.
user1: Who is the villan?
user2: When you watch the movie, not the scene which is set in present day Paris
user2: Danny Huston
user2: He plays the character of General Erich
user2: Jenkin is the first female director of a comic book superhero film, you must give this a try
user2: She is really good at it
user1: Cool. So it takes place in France.
user2: Do you generally watch movies with (good) ratings? 
user1: Yes
user2: The performance of Gal Gadot was stellar
user2: Great to hear that
user2: What is "good" rating accordingto you
user2: This movie has a rating of 7.6 / 10 on imdb
user2: And a metacritic score of 76/100
user1: Anything higher than 7 on imdb
user2: That's wonderful. So, this meets your criteria
user1: That's really good!
user2: Yes it is
user1: I'll give it a try.

user1: Who starred in the movie?
user2: Robert downey

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: Hello
user1: What would you like to talk about?
user2: Did you like the movie of wonder woman?
user1: I did not see it.  Did you?
user2: I haven't yet, but apparently it has a lot of mythological references like zeus and the god of war Ares so I'd be very interested in it. The main character grows up in an amazon island, would you be interested in watching it?
user1: That sounds very interesting.  I didn't realize it had all of those aspects involved in the plot.
user2: The main lead is Gal Gadot who was said to be a very inspiring choice to play the lead of wonder woman. She had previously debuted in Batman vs Superman
user1: Oh that's cool.  I haven't seen Batman vs Superman either.  I'm glad that she has gotten this role.
user2: What do you think about movies in the superhero genre?
user1: I normally do not go out of my way to see them but if they come on television and my husband is watching it, I will usually watch it.  I end up liking them when I do see them but never seek them out.
user2: Apparently Diana, Wonder Woman uses the concept of love to fight off against war. That seems fairly unique to superhero movies which are usually just about action. Do you prefer more black and white movies, or morally gray ones?
user1: That is a very unique approach to fighting against war, especially in super hero movies.  I love black and white movies.
user2: The setting is in World War 1 as well so if you're a fan of history you might just end up loving the backdrop for it
user1: Oh I didn't realize that.  You're teaching me quite a bit about the structure of this movie.  It sounds very interesting.
user1: From what you've said they have found a way to merge world history with mythology.
user2: They have, it's fascinating cause mythology and history are linked together closely and if you think about, the superheros in the movie genre are like modern mythology
user1: You make a very good point that I hadn't yet considered.
user2: One of the scenes I love from what I've read of the movie is when Diana looks at a world war 1 picture of her and her friends reminiscing at the past
user2: it must suck to be immortal and see people die like her
user1: Ha!  I would hate to be immortal because of that very reason.  Everyone you know dies.  That must suck.
user2: In the movie it's Ares who betrays the other Gods, it's refreshing in a sense because in greek mythology our modern culture always paints everything as being Hades's fault
user1: Oh, a change of perspective and focus for mythology.  I like it.  
user2: The male lead of the story sacrifices himself by piloting a bomber set to destroy, it makes for a really tragic ending you don't see people actually die in most superhero movies. A lot of people seem to agree that they liked it, it got a 92% average on rotten tomatoes
user1: Do you know how the Ares part folds into the plot and his relationship with Wonder Woman?
user1: Oh wow a 92%?  That is very rare for a Rotten Tomatoes score.  
user2: Apparently the character playing Ares has been implanting subtle ideas into humans throughout history encouraging warfare and the only way to kill him was with a godkiller weapon that turns out it was Wonder Woman
user1: I like how that is worked in.  
user2: Especially because Ares is the God of War and it's nice to see that theme being implemented
user1: I agree.  Implemented in a creative way too.
user2: The movie takes place in Themyscrian which I believe is where the amazon island resides. It's refreshing to see a superhero movies take on a majority female cast 
user1: I agree.  Most female roles in super hero movies tend to be minor, supporting parts.  Even though being a "super hero" is not something one can achieve conventionally, it is a good representation for young girls to see.  Seeing other girls or women in powerful positions allows them to realize that they also have potential.
user2: Goodbye it was nice talking!

conversation:
user1: So what is the difference between Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic?
user2: I have no idea. So what do you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
user1: I thought she did a perfect job, great choice. What about you?
user1: feel free to speed it up
user2: I thought so too, she was an inspired choice for this role.
user2: I’m trying to read about the movie!

conversation:
user2: Do you enjoy super hero movies?
user1: have you seen the movie?
user2: I have not, but it's on my list
user1: yes i do.  i especially liked this one.
user1: the woman who directed it, patty jenkins, also directed monster
user2: oh that was good, I hope to see the movie soon
user1: who is your favorite superhero
user2: Ummm....I have always like Superman, mostly because I loved the show Smallville when I was younger lol
user2: Who is your favorite?
user1: i like superwoman
user2: I don't think I know that character, I actually am not really familiar with comic books.
user2: How did you like the wonder woman portrayal by Gal Gadot?  I've heard that she was great in it.
user1: she did a great job.  i was very impressed
user1: robin wright was great too
user2: I didn't realize the movie was set during World War 1, I love history so that makes it more interesting to me.
user1: oh yes lots of history
user2: Is the movie very violent?
user1: in parts, but it is tastefully done i thought
user2: I don't see what it is rated, do you think it would be appropriate for a young teen?
user2: I'm always looking for fun movies to watch with my kids
user1: yes i think so, there aren't any sex scenes or anything
user1: i would be ok taking my young teen to see it
user2: It looks like it has some pretty great themes, of self sacrifice and love of family, good vs. evil.  All the things that are good about superhero movies.
user2: lol, I love that they add other D.C. characters in that is fun
user2: It is also interesting that it ends back in modern times
user1: yes it is, i don't really know the difference between dc and marvel
user2: me either
user1: do you like the hulk?
user2: I can't say that he is one of my favorites, but he can be entertaining
user1: i think he is one of the underappreciated super heros

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello! Ever got the chance to see the Wonder Woman movie?
user1: yeah, you?
user1: Its a really good one
user2: Yeah. I really liked it as well. I love Gal Gadot's performance
user1: O yes. and also chris pine was great and hilarious 
user1: Have you seen it more than once?
user2: No actually. Have you?
user1: Nah just once, I thought you did because you seem to like it
user1: Do you think there would be a second part
user2: I should to be honest. Have you seen the other recent DC films like Batman v Superman 
user1: movies like that usually do
user2: Yah. They released new of a sequel
user1: nah
user1: i havent seen that one
user1: i didnt even know that came out
user1: lol
user2: Whoops! I meant they are planning for its sequel. Would you see it?
user1: oh umm.. i need to see the trailer and then I would decide
user1: What about black panther
user1: it comes out this weekend are you seeing it
user2: Oh I am down for that film. Already have my tickets!
user1: lmao
user1: i know
user1: that movie would make so much money this weekend
user2: Oh yeah! I believe its the last installment before the Avenger's Infinity War
user1: wow you know a lot of this marvel dc stuff
user1: why do you like this movie wonder woman?
user2: Lol! I follow the superhero stuff. The film received a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. To me its a good super hero film regardless of whether its a man or woman. 
user2: What did you like about the film?
user1: lol, i know when I saw they were finally making a female main lead, I was pretty excited, plus I like action films and fictional movies
user2: Exactly and they did it justice. I also like the setting of it being in World War  1
user1: I know, am not really into war movies, but this one managed to not make it so depressing with all the action and stuff
user2: It really did. It would great seeing them do the Amazon setting. 
user1: Oh yeah
user1: what other kinds of movies do you like
user2: I like Sci-Fi and Adventure films. Like Star Wars or Mad Max 
user2: Yourself?
user1: I like adventure films too, fantasy; something like harry potter, lord of the rings. and comedy too
user2: Lord of the Rings is my favorite. Thank you for this conversation!

conversation:
user1: Hi
user1: How are you
user2: Hi, I'm good, I hope you are too. 
user2: Do you like Superhero movies?
user1: yes Thank you
user1: yes to some extent
user1: what about you
user2: I love them. Have you heard of Wonder Woman?
user1: yes
user1: about Princess Diana?
user2: Did you know that it has 92% on Rotten Tomatoes?
user2: Yup, that's the one!
user1: really? That's interesting to know
user2: It was directed by Patty Jenkins, who was inspired by Richard Donner and Christopher Nolan movies.
user1: I think the movie is a thriller
user1: yes
user2: The movie is not a thriller, it's a Superhero Drama set during the backdrop of World War 1
user1: okay.
user1: Diana leaves her home to end all the wars right?
user1: what is the name of that pilot who gets crashed and rescued by her
user2: Yes, she does. She leaves because she wants to hunt down the god Ares and stop him
user2: The pilot is Steve Trevor and he is played by Chris Pine
user1: okay. What do you think about the reviews
user2: I think that the reviews are accurate. One of them mentions that the action is thrilling and that the character of Diana is compelling, which I'm inclined to agree with
user1: that's true
user2: Yup. Plus the Metacritic score and Cinemascore (76/100 and A, respectively) back up the claims positive praise
user1: quite interesting
user2: The climax of the movie is quite thrilling as well
user1: right
user1: what is the general's name of the german army
user1: he has played a good role
user2: That would be General Erich Ludendorff played by Danny Huston
user1: okay.
user1: It was nice talking to you.have a great day! bye

conversation:
user2: Hello did you get to see the Movie Wonderwoman that was produced in 2015?
user1: NO i havent, can you tell me a little about the movie?
user2: Well its based on a character from DC Comics and has a bit of greek mythology like Ares.
user1: Did you like the movie? 
user2: I love the move and I think you should go and watch it because if you seen Batman Vs Superman, it connects to them through the DC universe.  The Film is a bout a Princess Diana, who grows up on an Amazon island and starts discover herself a bit on that island.
user1: Is there a lot of action in the movie? 
user2: Yes you get to see Wonderwoman trying to help men stop the worldwar but she things the war is started by the God Ares, god of war.  Diana leaves the island to go help stop the war.
user1: does the movie depict alot of violence or sexuality? 
user2: Is much more of a woman who is a demi god that uses love to fight a way, and it actually it does sound funny but the director Patty Jenkins makes it work.
user1: what is your favorite scene in the movie? Does it show the importance of the plot?
user1: where is the movie filmed?
user2: my favorite scene in the movie is when Princess Diana receives a photographic plate of he and the four men that she teams up with during the way, it was near the end and it gave her a good recall of the past.
user1: how did the movie make you feel? 
user2: The movie felt good it is nice to see a woman having powers, and fighting evil man during World war 1
user1: are there any religious ties or beliefs? 
user2: The movie has a tie to to the Greek Mythology Zeus and Ares, in the movie it explained a bit on how Amazonian warriors were created by Zeus to protect mankind.  
user1: did it meet your expectations?
user1: did you like the ending?
user1: why would you recommend the movie?
user1: Is this your type of genre of movie?
user2: It does meets my expectations because it goes into details about Princess Diana origins,  Diana was created and Zeus also had a son name Ares, and it tells how Ares was jealous by humanity and try to destroy humans.
user1: Did you see the movie in a theater?
user1: Ares sounds like a bad person!
user2: The ending was great because you get to see Wonder Woman fight Ares and you get to see the full potential of Wonder Woman at the end.
user1: what do you think could have been changed? what didn't you like?
user2: Genre is Drama and superhero so yes its my kind of movie.  I saw the movie at home with my wife and son.  
user1: Did your wife like the movie?
user2: so let me tell you the rest of the plot that you might like
user1: ok
user2: Ares appears near the end and tells Diana he had given humans ideas and inspirations.  he did not corrupt humans intentionally they chose that path.  It was humans that had resort to violence and got corrupted
user1: that sounds like a great movie!
user2: it is and there is more, because Diana thinks she has to kill Ares with a sword that was named the God Killer, but the sword is not the god killer, cause Ares breaks it
user1: WOW! That is alot of action!

user1: I do sometimes
user1: they can be subjective but its hard to go against over 90 percent
user2: I feel the same way, when the rating are in the 60- 80 range on RT it's kind of a toss up huh?
user1: yeah it can be
user1: Its usually just best to go see a movie regardless, reviews are so subjective
user2: Yeah, I like to form my own opinion. It' hard to let yourself enjoy a movie sometimes when you see it had bad reviews, almost like it poisoned your mind against it.
user2: *it's

user1: I absolutely love Gal Gadot as an actress. She is beautiful
user2: hi 
user1: hello

conversation:
user2: Hey
user2: What movie are you reading about?
user1: This movie is wonder Woman. 
user2: Nice. What kind of reviews did it get?
user2: What is the story about?
user1: There were good reviews. For instance, one review said the movie provides a welcome respire from DC's house style of grim darkness
user2: That's cool. So it stands out from movies in the past.
user2: Do you know what kind of themes the movie touches on?
user1: It's about a princess, Diana, who grows up on an island. A pilot crashes on an island and she rescues him. The pilot tells her about the wars going on and Diana leaves home to help end the war. 
user1: It's drama and superhero. It touches on themes of courage
user1: What do you think so far?
user1: About the movie?
user2: Diana sounds very noble
user1: Is it something you will be interested in watching?
user1: yes she is very noble and brave
user2: Yes I like that it's a DC movie with a female lead
user1: Me too.
user1: Have you watched the trailer yet?

conversation:
user1: hiii
user2: Hai. the movie is about wonder women
user2: did you saw the movie?
user1: yes i saw that movie

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hey have you seen Wonder Woman yet?
user1: Not yet. Is it worth seeing?
user2: Honestly when it first came out i was kinda Leary about seeing it but when i did i thought it was pretty good Rotten tomatoes gave it a 92 i think
user1: That sounds decent. What did you like about it?
user2: Because they didn't make it to sexually like they did when they did the movie cat woman  They focused on the super hero and what she could do and didn't make it into a chick flick because she was a woman 
user1: Did you have a favorite scene?
user2: Not really without giving the movie away since you haven't seen it 
user1: Is there a lot of action?
user2: To be honest it kind of starts off slow but picks up after the first 25 minutes after that its action packed 
user1: Is it funny like Marvel movies or more dark like DC?
user2: Ummm no there is not much humor that i remember 
user1: Should I watch it before Justice League?
user2: yes because it kind of ties into that movies 
user1: I thought it might. 
user2: Yes it all ties in just like the batman vs superman movie before it 
user1: I didn't like the Batman vs Superman. Will I still like Wonder woman?
user2: it depends what didn't you like about Batman vs Superman 
user1: The entire plot seemed stupid. If they would have just talked to each other they could have avoided half the movie
user2: That is true well there is no stupid plots in Wonder Woman so i think you would like it 
user1: Maybe I will try to check it out. 
user2: yes please do you wont regret it 
user1: Anything else I should know before I do?
user2: how much do you know about wonder woman now?
user1: Not much, just that she has a whip of truth
user1: Well I think I know enough for now. Thanks
user2: your welcome 

conversation:
user1: Hi--what is the movie about?
user2: The movie is Wonder Woman.
user1: Oh, I absolutely love wonder Woman from years ago.
user2: It is based on a DC comic book, about a woman with super powers.
user1: I really like action movies like those.
user2: Yes, she leaves the island that she grew up on to save the world.
user1: Who stars in it?
user2: Gal Gadot stars in the movie.
user1: Is it like a comic book or is it live action?
user2: It is a live action flick, based on a comic book.
user1: It really sounds like a fun flick.  Is it an all female main cast?
user2: No, It has a diverse cast of men and women.
user1: I like that--it makes the movie more interesting for all.
user2: Yes the cast is very good.  I like the actors: Godot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Danny Huston.
user1: I like Robin Wright.  I think she's the President in House of Cards but I'm not sure.
user2: Yes I believe so, she has a small but crucial part in this movie.
user1: I know my granddaughter saw it and loved it, so now I'm going to have to see it too.
user2: Yes, it is an action flick, so if you love those then you will like this.
user1: I wonder if it's available to stream?  I don't get to the movies as often as I'd like but this movie seems worth it to me.
user2: When I say action I mean superhero, it is technically a drama.  I do not know if you can stream it yet.
user1: I really hope it's available soon.  I don't think it's in theaters right now.
user2: It is too old to be in theaters I think.
user1: I hope I like it as much as I did the older Wonder woman movies.
user2: You might.  In this one we meet her mother Hippplyta.  She is Queen of the Amazons.
user1: Wow, that sounds exciting.  What else happens?
user2: Wonder woman leaves the Amazon Island after she learns of the War (WW1).
user1: World War 1 I guess it reaches back into history quite a bit.
user2: Yes it takes place during the war.
user1: I wonder why they chose that era?
user2: I am not sure, but it works.
user1: I guess we can finish now--and thank you
user2: thanks

conversation:
user2: Hello, today I would like to introduce to you the movie Wonder Woman.
user1: Good Afternoon what did you think about the wonder woman movie? Have you ever seen any other DC Comics movies?
user1: Thank you. This is the first Patty Jenkins movie's I've seen
user2: In my opinion Wonder Woman was the best DC comics live action movie they have done to date. 
user2: I don't know about Cris Pine playing Steve Trevor, though.
user1: My favorite part is when Steve Trevor crashes
user1: Me either. I also did not know Danny Huston was the General
user2: What did you think about Gal Gadot playing Wonder woman
user1: I think it was a great choice in actors honestly
user1: I wouldnt consider this a war movie though as the critics do
user2: I think so too, the critics always have something to say about everything, though
user2: It did score high on Rotten tomatoes thoug 
user2: a 92% is a decent score
user1: Definitely but I dont agree with the metacritic score of 76. I think it should have definitely been higher
user2: True, the story did have a few holes but altogether it was a good depiction of Wonder Woman.
user1: I agree. What do you think about the last critics comment?
user1: Do you think Jenkins made that concept work?
user2: I think that it is a bit cliché to say love defeats all but in retrospect it does work. and in the movie it did
user2: except for Trevor dying
user1: What about the end? I still dont get how Diana leaving her home solved the war
user1: Yea that was aweful
user2: It doesn't solve anything, she just wanted out of the island
user1: Yea thats why i dont get why it says "Diana then leaves her home in order to end the conflict"
user2: I think it was just a precursor to the Justice League films
user1: Do you agree with the key scenes? I wouldnt claify those as the actual key scenes of this movie. Maybe 1 out of the thre
user2: I agree, the scene shown are too vague and don't depict the movie's top key scenes
user1: I also was unaware this was based in present day Paris. Thats definitely interesting to me
user1: I agree
user1: Im glad however that it did get the ratings it deserves besides the metacritic ratings the cinemaScore A and rotten tomatoes 92% are accurate I believe
user2: What about the end scene where Diana sends Bruce Wayne an email thanking him, what did you think of that?
user1: I think that was a bit wierd and out of character for this movie
user1: What about you
user2: It was, and I think Diana shouldn't have to reaffirm her convictions to fight evil
user1: Agreed.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi, Would you like to discuss the wonder woman movie?
user2: Yes, I would.
user1: I have read that it received very good reviews.
user2: Oh it did? It must be pretty good, then.
user1: Yes. I am ready for more female superhero movies.
user2: Me too. I think it would be good to have more of them.
user1: Since it supposedly takes place in the Amazon, I wonder if there are good scenery shots as well?
user2: I bet there are. It is probably beautiful. 
user1: I have also read that it is a quite violent movie being about war and all.
user2: Really? I wonder how graphic those scenes are. 
user1: I was wondering the same.
user2: The violence probably adds to the intensity of the film.
user1: I am sure you are right.  These type movies can be a bit cheesy but with this one getting such high marks, I am encouraged.
user2: Yeah, I definitely like to check the reviews before I see a movie so I'm glad this film received good ones. 
user1: I have also read there are scenes in Paris.  I always love to see those since I have never been.
user2: Oh wow. I have never been either. It would be cool to see. I hear it's lovely.
user1: As well as scenery, I also enjoy special effects. I have read a  few things which has caused to wonder what type are in this movie
user2: I see. I have noticed in some new movies lately that CGI is a little over done in my opinion. I hope it isn't too cheesy in Wonder Woman. Do you know if any reviews have addressed that specifically? 
user1: No, I have not read anything on that specific topic.  I don't know that it would have received such high marks if the CGI was not done well.  Seems like someone would have mentioned it.
user2: That's probably true. I imagine a big film like this put enough work into it to make it good. 
user1: You know I never realized the roots of Wonder Woman being Mythology but from I have read, she apparently lived during the time of Zeus and that is why she has special powers.
user2: Wow, I didn't know that either. I just thought it was something someone completely made up. 
user1: Well I still think she is probably made up but then I think Mythology is as well but I realize not all people do.  I also did not realize she was considered a warrior but after reading how she peaked during a "war time" and was "trained for battle", I guess she must be a real bad a**.
user2: I think you're absolutely right about her. She seems like an amazingly strong female character. 
user1: Well said. I usually do not watch movies based from DC comic characters because I have not liked them in the past, but after what I have read, I would like to see this one.
user2: I actually agree. I have not liked DC that much but I think this one might be an exception. 
user1: I have read there are some great scenes in the movie. One of the first about how Zeus created this race of Amazonian women to protect mankind and we see the history of how it all unfolded.
user2: Wow that's crazy! That is a very interesting way to introduce them.
user1: Yes it is. I have enjoyed chatting with you. Thank you for discussing this movie with me. I think I will go out and see it.
user2: Thank you, me too.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello!
user2: The movie is Wonder Woman, I actually really liked this movie, have you heard of it? 
user1: No I haven't. What's the theme? And who plays within it?
user2: It is about an Immortal Amazonian Princess Diana 
user2: Gal Gadot plays her
user2: its based on a comic book
user2: its set during Wold War 1
user2: World*
user1: That actually sounds interesting! Who would you say is the evil person in the movie? lol
user2: Its a German General named Erich Ludendorff, he is played by Danny Huston
user1: What did you like about the movie if you had to decide one thing?
user2: Probably the Thrilling action scenes
user1: Would you recommend it to people under the age of 18? Would it be an age appropriate movie?
user2: I am not sure abot that but did you know that Diana is the daughter of Zeus?
user1: no i didnt thats soooo cool
user1: How did the film make you feel? I mean does it have a certain type of message it gives?
user2: It wasnt as dark as most of the other movies but still had the action and feeling to make it pop
user1: How did it end? Was the problems within the movie resolved or was it a cliffhanger? Because i hate cliffhangers lol
user2: No it was resolved but it is part of a series so there are pieces that lead into other things but all main plot points were tied up with a nice bow
user1: Whose point of view was the movie in?
user2: It all really starts with Diana's half brother Ares
user2: he gets jealous of humanity and goes crazy but Zeus and the other gods stopped him at great loss to their selves as all but Zeus died
user2: Everything after that story is in Diana's veiw
user1: Whats the view of humanity?
user1: What does it say about humans?
user2: Humans are trying to stop and help him so its a toss up
user2: They always have a choice even with Ares giving them ideas so i guess its trying to say that humans are inherently flawed but you cant base everything on a few 
user1: What good insights into life about the film?
user1: How could that affect viewers?
user1: What was the motivation for the main character?
user2: Well while Ares is at it again it also gives Steve a chance to give his life to save others showing Diana that even in the face of all this evil there can still be good I think it shows a good bit of both sides its all about what you choose to do with life
user2: her motivation was to stop her brother and save humanity and her home 
user1: \What problems do the characters face?
user2: They are trying to stop them from releasing a toxin that is worse than mustard gas and they dont know who Ares is actually acting as until he shows himself in a last ditch effort to stop her
user1: Thanks so much so all the details
user1: After work im 100% going to watch it!
user2: good i am glad i could be helpful

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hey, have you ever seen Wonder Woman?
user2: no i havent
user2: have you?
user1: No, but it sounds pretty good
user2: im not big into superheroes, but if anything I would see this one
user1: It's based on the Comic character and tells the story of Princess Diana who grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira.
user1: I'm actually starting to love superhero movies. 
user2: do you think its geared more towards females, or no?
user1: Yeah, I think that it was time for women to have a superhero movie too.
user1: Do you generally look at ratings for the movie before watching them?
user2: Yes I do.  I look at rotten tomato and also at critic reviews
user2: do you?
user1: Yes, Rotten Tomatoes gave this a 92% so I think it would be good to watch it
user2: i hate to waste time/money on a bad movie
user2: i think my daughter would be interested in seeing this
user1: It would be a good bonding experience. You could show her that even women are strong and can save the world too
user2: true, we need strong female role models for our daughters
user2: im not familiar with the actors in this movie
user1: Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman
user2: Ive never heard of her
user1: I don't know what else she played in but I can see that she definitely fit the role to play Wonder Woman
user1: Do you know Chris Pine?
user2: No, havent heard of him either
user2: I always thought Wonder Woman was supposed to be a little bit older, like mid 30s
user1: I thought so too. She doesn't look too old or young though
user1: The plot seems really deep
user2: Yeah the plot seems more in depth than I thought 
user2: I guess I always think super hero movies are kind of superficial, but this doesnt seem so at all
user1: It's also based in present day Paris
user2: oh that's cool
user1: Yeah. I thought it would be an action movie but it's actually categorized as a Drama
user2: That is surprising
user2: ok bye
user1: ok

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: Hey! The movie is Wonder Woman. The reviews seems overwhelmingly positive.
user1: Wonder Woman sounds like a great movie.
user1: What actors are in it?
user2: Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston. I didn't know Robin Wright was in it!
user1: I am not sure who Robin Wright is.
user1: Are the reviews from critics or from everyday people?
user2: She was in House of Cards. The critical reviews seem professional, but it has a Rotten Tomatoes average of 7.6
user1: Nice.  Do you happen to know the runtime of the movie?
user2: Doesn't list it! Bet it goes on forever.
user1: Ya, superhero movies tend to be long
user1: Is the movie set in modern day or in the past?
user2: Some otherwordly planet called Themyscira
user1: Ok.  I am familiar with Wonder Woman the superhero, just not all the details.
user1: All sounds good.  What is your take on the movie?
user2: I haven't seen it, but I heard it was good. Might be one of those rainy day movies worth seeing. I was pleasantly surprised by the last superhero movie I saw.
user2: I feel like I should be getting a second movie to look at, but nothing's loading.
user1: I seem to enjoy superhero movies as well.
user2: I didn't realize it was released in 2015, I guess it has been that long..
user1: I would of thought it came out last year, time flys.
user2: Well, the page has reloaded twice but it's the same document so I guess we're stuck talking about Wonder Woman.
user2: Which other superhero movies have you seen?
user1: I think the last two I saw were Deadpool and Logan.  Both very good.
user1: And the only two rated R superhero movies
user2: I'll have to check them out. The last one I saw was Dr. Strange, which I enjoyed.
user1: I heard that was good too\
user1: I heard they are making a Wonder Woman 2 because the first one was so successful
user2: They tend to overplay their hands with these franchises.
user1: The Marvel ones seem to be more popular.  DC characters don't seem to draw as well
user2: Was she called Princess Diana in the comic books?
user1: Maybe.  I think she is the daughter of Zeus as well
user1: I am about to run out of time on this HIT :(
user2: Oh no!
user1: Feel like we have met the requirements
user2: I hope it finishes soon
user2: I believe so, there was a glitch on this end with documents loading
user2: There we go

conversation:
user2: You love this movies ? i love this movies
user1: Yes, I found it interesting.  How about you? 
user2: I loved it, i think she will be a good wonder woman in party 2
user1: Diana Prince made a wonderful Amazon warrior.  DC comics make for good movies.
user2: I agree, though some of them are pretty trash. Depending on the character
user1: I'm sorry, it was Gal Gadot that PLAYED Diana Prince.  Yes, some of the DC characters are lacking. 
user2: Jenkins did a pretty good job with this one
user1: Yes.  I liked how she used love to fight war.  His concept on that was great, especially for these times we are in.
user2: the younger wonder woman did a nice acting too in here
user1: She did.  It was a fresh perspective.  Rotten Tomatoes gave it 92%, which I believe is pretty darn good.
user2: I stopped going to IMDB and only use RT now because it seems there are so many paid reviews on the IMDB
user1: I havent noticed that.  I"ll have to look into it.  I thought it was interesting how Diana was hidden in the island of Themyscira.  Zues created it to protect the Amazonian warrior women from man. 
user2: yes my wife liked taht part pretty beautiful scenery
user1: It was indeed.  Chris Pine did great in this movie as Steve, her love interest.  Did you think so>
user2: i do not think he fit that role honestly, would have been glad to see someone like a Jason Mamoa in that role
user1: Really? I enjoyed it and thought he did a good job.  I wasn't a fan of the bad guy.  Was that Danny HUston?
user2: Thats another one that did not fit the role imo
user1: Really? ok, Well what about Hippolyta, Diana's mother? She forbid Diana from leaving the island initially, but at least she has her sister to train here just in case.
user2: i loved her, she fit the role nicely
user2: so mahy things seem out of place but i agree its not out of place
user1: I thought so, too.  And then Antiope was played by Robin Wright, a fantastic actress!
user2: i hope they dont ruin the cast and bring them back for the next one
user1: I thought it was sweet how she sacrificed herself to save Diana when the Amazonians invaded. 
user2: pretty spot on 
user1: Oh and then there was Ares.  Ugh! I was not a fan of his character in the movie.  I thought he himself was a good actor, but I always hate the villians.  He tries to turn Diana using her pain over losing Steve.  What did you think?
user2: i thought so too hahaha . too dramatic and was not necssary
user1: Im the kind that always wants a happy ending, even though I know that isnt necessarily realistic.  But I wasnt a fan of how this ended.  Sure, she defeated Ares and decided to stay and fight for the world, but her man died.  :(
user2: oh yea oh definitely 
user1: I still say Steve did a great job, even though you dont agree.  lol.  The way he hijacked the plane to get the bomb far enough away to detonate it safely and sacrificed himself.  
user2: haha so corny
user1: Does this thing automatically finish or what? Weve done over 12 turns?
user2: i think so but if not we cna just fish the conversation button

conversation:
user2: hai
user1: Hello, how are you?
user2: fine
user1: Are you a fan of Wonder Woman the comic book character?
user2: No
user2: I have watching wonder women movie only
user1: Well, I think if you watched the 2015 Wonder Woman movie you would be. It was rated a 92% on rotten tomatoes.
user1: Oh, did you like it?
user1: It received an A on CinemaScore as well.
user2: Yes I liked the movie. The rating of the movie 90% 
user1: Don't you think Gal Gadot as Princess Diana was great? I really enjoyed her.
user2: Born to play the role of "Wonder Woman", Gadot proves that women can be fierce and loyal, as well as empathetic, in director Patty Jenkins' epic, satisfying origin story.
user1: Yes I agree, the movie had a wonderful portayal of Themyscira, the land of the Amazon women. 
user1: Robin Wright also did an amazing job as the general of the Amazons.
user1: It received a 7.6 on Metacritic which is very high for that site.
user1: Patty Jenkins really did an amazing job directing it.
user2: yes 
user1: Chris Pine also gave a stellar performance as Steve Trevor.
user1: It was fun to see Wonder Woman fall in love with him.
user1: Did you think Chris Pine did a good job in the movie?
user2: Petty Jenkins catches the nerves of audience with the feel and tone of her storytelling.
user1: Absolutely, she really made the movie come alive.
user2: Petty Jenkins catches the nerves of audience with the feel and tone of her storytelling.
user2: This movie was different(much better) then I expected. Dawn of Justice was good, and watching right after that movie, I have a new found appreciation for DC universe movies(being a Marvel Universe fan). The bonds between characters were conveyed well, and the character development was done quite well for a single movie
user1: I really enjoyed how the movie was a flash back from the photo that was taken of her team during the war. 
user1: I agree, I was expecting it to be much different and was pleasantly surprised
user1: I really liked seeing her use her lasso to interrogate her enemies.
user2: yes i do 
user1: Did you think Ares was a good enemy?
user2: yes 
user1: Me too. I thought it was great when Sir Patrick turned out to be Ares.
user1: I thought for a moment Diana may have been wrong. It caught me by surprise.
user1: I also really liked how Diana kept disobeying her mother and training in spite of her commands.
user2: Ares, god of war, whom she’s convinced is responsible for the ongoing barbarity on Flanders Field and other parts of Europe. 
user2: She has no evidence for that. She simply believes that humans are inherently good and that there’d be no war if Ares weren’t putting evil thoughts in people’s heads.
user1: Yea. I thought she was wrong, but then Ares shows up at the end and proves her right. I liked that scene.
user2: Gadot didn’t wow me in her debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Her elation while fighting made for a welcome counterpoint to all the gloom, but she seemed like a stiff out of costume.
user1: Yea I agree. So my expectations for Wonder Woman were low when I went to see it.
user2: The movie really snaps to life when Diana and Steve arrive in London to plead with the British command to give them resources to take on Ludendorff. 

conversation:
user2: This moved scored well with the ratings.
user1: Right, but do you think it's 'sloppy" at times, like in one of the reviews? 
user2: True. But it was her first war movie. Maybe there will be a next one and that can be corrected.
user1: Do you think the next Wonder Woman movie will be better or worse than the first, given the sequels' lack of improvement, typically
user1: I loved that she was actively defending people, not a particular side.
user2: We can hope for better, they should always strive for better. 
user1: Is there anything specific you did not like about it? 
user2: Not particularly. I loved how they portrayed a female superhero. 
user2: Was there anything you did not like?
user1: Of course, but nothing major. I was amazed that they were able to be fluent in EVERY language despite never leaving the island, and being under the threat of "Once you go, you can't come back"
user1: Also that they were created to protect mankind, but stuck on a remote island.
user2: How interesting do you feel that learning the Amazonian history would be?
user1: Very - unlike human history, they can basically make anything up that they want. In human history, you can't fudge it too much and a lot of it is alreayd know. 
user2: The ability to bring in the culture and so much knowledge into this movie and allow it to go so fluidly is really impressive.
user1: What did you think about her portrayal? Did you buy Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman or is there someone else you'd prefer?
user2: I feel she did a great job. They should continue to use her in the sequel. 
user1: Well, they did. She was confirmed and probably already paid 
user2: There is so much going on in this move. Do you think they put to much into it or does it seem to fit?
user1: It fits perfectly; there wasn't that much to it. 
user1: What did you think of the armies vs. the Amazons when they crashed on the island? 
user1: I thought it was a bit silly.
user2: When Antiope sacrificed herself to save Diana it was very engaging to me.
user2: Some things seemed a bit far stretched.
user1: I thought it was ridiculous that an army with guns lost a single person to a group with zero guns. The fight should have lasted seconds.
user2: How do you feel they did with her lasso? Was it believable?
user1: A "lasso of truth" can never be believable. It seems less effective than other means
user1: Did you think Ares was played by someone other than Sir Patrick? I remember people being fooled
user2: I wasn't really fooled. I like to ruin movies and look for spoilers early on. 
user1: Ruining movies isn't nice. The final battle between her and Ares seemed to cause very little destruction compared to Superman vs. Zod
user2: True, but I don't like surprises. I'm not sure how she could cause as much destruction. As you said before, and I agree, her weapon is less effective. 
user1: Do you think she should have killed Ares? He's a god, after all.
user2: Seemed to show the audience her "power" by being able to kill a God. The lightning thing is kind of cool.
user2: There's so many people sacrificing themselves in this movie. A little much maybe?
user1: No, that's what makes us human.
user1: So, my question going forward is: does humanity worship her as a God? She's the last remaining God, so all the greek legends were true, which disproves all religion.
user2: Technically you would believe they'd have to. Would her being the daughter of Zeus not make humanity worship her as a God even if she wasn't the only one?
user1: Probably but there would be tons of deniers.

conversation:
user1: Do enjoy movies based on comic books?
user2: Why, yes, I do.
user1: Do you also enjoy movies about war?
user2: It all depends on the basis of the movie. If it is fictional, space-like war, I enjoy that type.
user1: This movie is somewhere in the middle. 
user1: It is based on a fictional heroine trying to stop a war. 
user2: Ah, ok! 
user2: Ohh, that is more around my speed as far as war is concerned.
user2: What is the movie name?
user1: Wonder Woman. 
user2: Oh, ok and so she is trying to stop a war? How does it all begin?
user2: Is she fighting a war for her homeland or is it a war in the US?
user2: What other information can you tell me about the movie?
user1: In the beginning the movies tells of her life.  Her day-to-day routine is interrupted when a pilot crashes on her planet. 
user1: The war is actually a world war. 
user2: Oh, ok...
user2: So is it initiated by the pilot crashing onto her planet?
user1: She must agree to leave her homeland in order to attempt to save the world. 
user2: Oh wow! And what are the stipulations for her leaving her homeland?
user2: Does she have a husband or children in this movie?
user1: None are discussed. Just that she must leave her home in order to end the conflict. 
user1: It implies that leaving may mean she will not be able to return. 
user2: Oh ok. So why is there a war that she must fight to save the world
user2: ?
user1: Regular humans have started a world war.  It is her destiny to help mankind. 
user2: Ah. Ok, so it is her destiny. Interesting.
