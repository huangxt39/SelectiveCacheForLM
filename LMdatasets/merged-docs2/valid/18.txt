Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper
Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody

critical response:
a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings
the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made ... [with] more zest than an early  picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way
Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark.
It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims. ... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action ... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary
Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. ... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.
scare machine that works with computer-like precision. ... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy

description:
A beach party takes place at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While , she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack. 
When local fishermen catch a large , the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable 's tooth embedded in the submerged . He drops it after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill the beaches. Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby , killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire Quint. 
Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a  line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint examines the shark and harpoons a barrel into it, but it drags the barrel underwater and disappears. With the Orca slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on  and enters the water in a , intending to lethally inject the shark with  using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage. 

conversation:
user1: Hi! The movie I want to talk to you about today is Steven Spielberg's JAWS. It has a 97% review on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 8/10 IMDB rating!
user2: Yes, that was worth a one time watch back in the 70's!
user1: So do you agree with the ratings of the movie? Many people find it to be a scary thriller, but others describe it as being too gruesome. What do you think? Do you like this kind of movie?
user2: I found it to be to gruesome and didn't agree with the rating.  But then, I don't like violent movies.
user1: I hear ya. But, maybe you should give it another try! It's a classic movie full of action and suspense. Steven Spielberg never disappoints. Do you typically like Steven Spielberg movies?
user2: I'm not sure as to whether I'd like to give it another try or not,  but then again I liked ET. 
user1: Well, like one person put it, it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way. Since it's a classic, it might not be exactly as you remember. Might be worth the watch even if just for the laughs!
user2: Perhaps the humor is subtle.  I recall not really seeing to much humor in it though, 
user1: Well, I suppose the film works for both types of people. Some love it because of its action and because it's a scary thriller, while others find it to be more humorous and funny. 
user2: That's true, and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like, or don't care for. 
user1: Yeah, that's true. But, of course, most watch it for the thrill. For example, there is a scene in the movie where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While she's in the water, she's suddenly pulled under! It's unexpected and thrilling, one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie. 
user1: I honestly don't know what else to say...... This has been going on way too long and is honestly silly. I'm going to return the HIT. Hopefully you can abort the conversation and still get paid. This is terrible
user2: Ok, let's get this done.  Nice chatting with you either way!  :-)

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you today?
user2: hello??
user1: Hello,
user2: hi
user1: I was thinking of how I remember what a good movie the original Jaws was.
user1: Do you like action movies?
user2: I do somewhat is jaws an action movie?
user1: Yes, definitely.  It is a classic, but still very action packed even for today.
user2: I don't know much about it.. can you refresh me?
user1: It is about an extremely large great white shark that is way too close to a vacation beach.
user2: That sounds terrifying!
user1: A marine biologist and the police try to hunt it before it hurts anyone else.
user1: The first scene is legendary when a woman is dragged under by Jaws.
user2: Well i DON'T KNOW IT BUT SOUNDS ENTERTAINING.
user2: opps sorry for the caps,lol
user2: Anyone famous in it?
user1: No problem.  Yes, some of it's best scenes are just suspense where you don't even see the shark.
user2: I feel on edge just thinking about it.
user1: Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss are in it.  The characters seem very real.
user1: Steven Spielberg directed it and it is very well done.
user2: I really lke Richard Dreyfuss.
user2: Oh wow.
user1: Yes, me too.  He is a very likable actor!
user2: And very talented.
user1: The mayor of the beach town is kind of the bad guy as he doesn't want to tell the beach goers how dangerous the beach is.
user2: I also really like Steven Spielberg but who doesn't.
user2: Ah SO THE BAD GUY ..
user1: Yes, the movie is rated very highly and was kind of revolutionary at the time it was released.
user1: It may be too gruesome for children though!
user2: You have peaked my interest for sure.
user2: Oh so not a kids movie.
user2: What is it rated?
user1: I hope that you check it out.  It is based on a 1974 novel by Peter Benchley.  I'm not sure what it is rated, but probably R.
user2: I never knew it was based on a novel.
user2: Maybe I will read the book first.
user1: Yes, I may read it also and I'll see the movie again as it is an oldie, but a goodie.
user2: Have you read the novel?
user1: No, but I just might.
user2: Oh now I see you have not yet.
user2: I find books hard to read after watching the movie.
user1: No problem.  Me too.  The shark in the movie looks very real.
user2: Is it cgi?
user2: or that wasn't around then..
user1: I think it was a robotic shark, but am not sure.
user2: Well you have certainly made me want to go watch it and see what all the hype is about.
user1: Great!  You at least will be able to say that you saw a revolutionary classic of that time.
user2: Cool, nice chatting, bye.
user1: Bye and have fun at the movie!

conversation:
user2: You should try watching the 1975 film jaws!  It has a rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.  
user1: I think I saw that many many years ago.  How many Jaws movies did they make?
user2: I am not sure on that but spielburg is blessed with talent many moviemakers dont posses.  He actually know how to tell a story!
user1: He did make many good movies.  What are some of your favorites?  Was this the first time you saw Jaws?
user2: Yes, it was the first time.  To gruesome for children to watch.  
user1: I think I was pretty young when I saw it the first time.  I remember blood, but not all the gruesome scenes.  I doubt my children have seen it.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user1: I think you are suppose to be asking questions

conversation:
user2: What is your opinion on the movie Jaws? 
user1: To be honest, I find shark movies to be terrifying.
user2: I can't say I blame you. The movie definitely makes that fear worse! 
user1: Did you know that this film was based on a book?
user2: No, I didn't. Not surprised though. Most movies tend to be. 
user2: I do love the Jaws music though. 
user1: Agreed, it heightens the tension and makes it scarier, but that's kind of the point.
user2: Are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film's critic score? And if I heard the music while driving, I would think someone was coming to take me out. Haha
user1: 97% is incredibly high, I would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere.
user1: Do you agree that it's a "cheerfully perverse" scare movie?
user2: That's what I thought as well. Maybe it's because it was never done before in it's time and was so different when it came out? It might be easier to "give it a pass" And I would say it could be "cheerfully perverse" depending on the kind of movies you enjoy. 
user2: Do you think that it "is too gruesome for children"? 
user1: For small children, yes. I could see them having nightmares.
user2: I definitely agree with that. I do find it odd that it is considered a "Thriller" film. 
user1: I think it's interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of the shark attacks. Makes you wonder if they'd cover something like that up to make more money in real life.
user2: In today's society, I think that would absolutely be the case. Even if there was a bounty hunter hired, they would probably go, "Nothing to see here, have fun!" 
user2: I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional "New England resort town". You would think they would've picked somewhere in California since there's so many beaches and how huge it is. 
user1: Agreed, there typically aren't many shark attacks in New England, usually further south or on the west coast.
user1: I can't imagine I would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.
user2: I agree. The movie is kind of silly the more you think about it. Especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine. Yet people keep dying? I guess they want you to suspend disbelief. Haha. 
user2: Or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money. 
user1: I wasn't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore. 
user1: The key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white.
user2: I wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open? He's far to adamant about keeping them open. And I always thought Tiger Sharks were smaller. 
user2: I always think of Great White's as the huge "Jaws" sharks. 
user1: It seems odd that they don't ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene.
user1: Even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it.
user2: I agree. They have an "Oceanographer" to help determine a shark attack. But no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation. 
user1: It seems like a pretty poor plan, and they end up having to make it up as they go along. 
user2: It seems crazy that a shark could take out a "Shark-proof" cage. 
user1: Plus, the reward of only $10,000 seems pretty low to risk lives.
user1: Maybe it was worth a lot more in 1975?
user2: I agree. Not worth it to me. I'll go on vacation in NYC instead and avoid the shark. Haha. 
user2: And it was definitely worth more in 1975. I just don't know how much. 

conversation:
user1: Great movie
user2: HI.  97% on rotten tomatoes.  that's really good, must be pretty good
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Steven Spielberg is an excellent director as well. 
user2: Have not
user2: Giant man eating shark attacking people makes for an entertaining watch
user1: yeah
user1: not much of a talker huh
user2: Probably wouldn't be good for kids though
user1: that depends
user2: I love Richard Dreyfus, didn't realize he was in it
user2: Of course the woman who is skinny dipping get's snagged first
user2: closing the beaches, knee jerk reaction but probably a good idea
user2: and of course they get greedy and want to pretend its a boating accident and not a shark attack
user2: shark hunter over charging lol
user2: bounty on the killer shark
user2: do like this genre?4

conversation:
user1: One of my favorite movies of all time
user2: Mine too! I still get nervous going into the ocean
user1: So do I! It freaks me out, big time
user2: I know.I think this was one of Speilbergs best films.
user1: Most definitely 
user1: I love all of them, so I can't say that I have a favorite
user2: I love Richard Dreyfus and his Matt Hooper was fabulous. Did he get nominated or win an Oscar for that role?
user1: I'm not sure. If he didn't, he sure deserved it
user2: I find it interesting that Metacritics only had a score of 87/100 for Jaws. What were they using to measure this? Rotten Tomatoes gave it 97%
user1: I know, I don't get that either since it was the best in it's time and still is today, in my opinion.
user2: Agreed. I still like watching it when its on TV. I've been known to download it for a long flight too. The cast was outstanding and the music!!! Still gets me creeped out.
user1: Same here! My wife hates those movies and don't like to see them.
user1: I don't know how she can hate it, but it's my favorite
user2: I saw that the critics found it funny, in a weird sort of way. I think I kind of agree with that comment. There are moments that are funny, I can't say I agree with your wife, but it did scare some people too much. Maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it.
user2: I kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it
user1: It's so realistic and it could happen.
user1: It does happen more than you think
user2: It has happened! Thats whats so scary. Several attacks likek that off the east coast last summer.Felt like I was living Jaws! I stayed off the beach last summer!
user1: So did I, it freaked me out too much
user2: In the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe. Kind of like when we see a dolphin fin, scream, and then realize it was ok.The next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach. Jaws for real.
user1: I know, one reason why I try and stay out of the oceans
user2: I know theres an alligator hunter that finds and removes those guys. In the movie they paid Quint, Richard Dreyfus to find the shark. Who would do that in real life? Not me!
user2: 10K or not, I would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there
user1: No way, I wouldn't either
user1: Nope not at all
user2: sounds like you're pretty clever! Ironic they named the boat the Orca in the movie. Those Orcas are supposed to be pretty safe.
user1: Yeah, you know when you hear the music, look out
user2: And can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage? I know someone who did that once. They said they'd never do it again!
user1: No way! I would have a heart attack
user2: Well, at least Jaws had a happy ending. Not for the shark though. The good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie!

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: hi!
user1: Is the movie any good?
user2: have you watched 1975 thriller? by steven spielberg
user2: it acutallly good
user2: 97% rating
user2: on rotten tomatoes
user1: A 1975 Steven Spielberg  movie??? is the movie jaws?
user2: lol yes !
user2: i thought it said thriller
user2: thats the genre
user2: but the movie is jaws
user1: The movie is a thriller.When i watched for the first time, i was really scared
user2: i acutally havent seen the full movie
user2: do you recommend it?
user1: The movie is really scary despite the fact the shark is only shown full body at the end.
user2: thats cool 
user2: he dies with a gas tank in his mouth right?
user1: yes, with a big explosion
user1: why you never watched the whole movie?
user2: i never got too much into it but i remember the ending
user1: My favorite Spielberg movie is ET
user2: did Spielberg do the Indiana Jones?
user1: Yes, the whole series.Did you know Tom Selleck was supposed to be indiana jones?
user2: i did not i wonder how that wouldve been.
user1: can you imagine Indiana Jones not been played by Harrison Ford??
user2: no i cant!
user2: harrison ford is legend!
user1: Yes, but is hard to believe he only became famous at 35 years old because of star wars
user2: what did you think about the indiana jones movie with the aliens?
user1: The last one??? It did not have the same charm.
user2: yes! i felt the same way very different i had mixed feelings about it
user1: Harrison was too old to play the character.
user1: Have you seen a good movie lately at the theaters?
user2: its been awhile since ive been to the movies 
user2: but i did watch the hateful 8
user2: just recently for the first time
user2: it was really good
user1: Yes, that was a good one.I love Tarantino movies
user1: time to say goodbye,nice talking to you

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hello 
user2: so what did you think about jaws
user1: I think the movie is a classic
user2: yes I enjoyed the horor elements
user1: yea I was really spooked when I first saw the film as a kid
user2: i really love how the shark is a big threat to them
user1: yea and they had planes and everything and the shark was like godzilla haha
user2: so what's next
user2: it seems like jaws may not get another movie
user1: really? I thought they were making all sorts of remakes 
user2: I did not here about that and also scene on the beach was very scarey
user1: for me when the guys were trapped on the boat was what I found most scary 
user2: lots of places that I would be very scared to be at in real life
user1: maybe if there were sharks 
user2: yeah lol
user1: I try to stay away from the water myself to avoid sharks I dont find surfing to be worth the risk
user2: yeah I can't swim at all so it is out of the picture for me
user2: so water is always a fear of mine
user1: yea 
user1: I do like watching the waves
user1: surprised how they needed a professional to catch the shark
user1: all they needed was a bunch of guys with beer and guns lol
user2: yeah
user2: seems funny lol
user2: wonder where the next page gonna appear
user1: maybe 5mins
user2: quint died right at the end too
user2: that was dumb of them to try and use a strychnine on the shark
user2: it was a good movie though

conversation:
user1: Jaws was such a good movie!
user2: I agree. It was well made.
user1: The scares were well timed.
user2: I liked the soundtrack.
user2: What was your favorite part?
user1: I think it was utilizing a location like Amity Island. It made me feel as if the plot could happen anywhere.
user1: Was the soundtrack your favorite part?
user2: That makes sense. Yes, especially the part that it is so famous for. The sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience's fear and anxiety.
user1: Just another affirmation that Spielberg knew what he was doing even in post-production.
user1: Do you usually like this type of movie?
user2: No doubt. He is very good at making movies. No, it is not my favorite kind. I am not much into jump scares. I like documentaries. How about you?
user1: I like this type of movie around Halloween; otherwise, I enjoy action films.
user2: That is understandable. Halloween is a good time to scare yourself. 
user1: What did you think of the mayor's reaction to the shark attack?
user2: I think it was greedy. I agree it is best not to panic the public, but putting people in danger out of greed is not okay.
user1: Exactly, I thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally.
user1: Of how to present this to the public.
user1: Which in the end resulted in a shark-hunting frenzy
user2: I like to think of those things too. I did not like that part. I think I would have liked it better if the shark was led out to sea, but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that, not enough drama.
user1: You are right on that.
user1: It was nice to see characters such as Brody step up - though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action.
user1: I think Spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics.
user2: Yes. It was realistic, though I think much of it applies to politics of all types. 
user2: Money seems to always be highest priority.
user1: Unfortunately, true.
user1: And sadly we do not get galvanized to action sometimes until tragedy strikes.
user2: Have you seen other Spielberg movies?
user1: Yes, he has his shining moments and some duds along the way. I feel that more of his movies fall into the former rather than latter category.
user1: You?
user2: I know I have and that his movies are usually really well made, but I cannot remember which movies are his. I am very bad at stuff like that.
user2: I did not like the scuba part. I enjoy enjoy breathing.
user1:  I usually am as well.
user2: Sorry, for the typo.
user1: No worries. Completely agree on breathing/ I would not be getting in the water even with a cage.
user1: Well, thanks for sharing this conversation with me. It seems that our time has come to an end. I hope you have a wonderful morning, afternoon, night wherever you are.
user2: You as well.

conversation:
user2: hoii
user1: Hi. I loved the film, even though it's older, from 1975. Did you like it?
user2: I think Patty Jenkins' take on the comic was amazing.

conversation:
user2: Hi how's it going?
user1: Pretty good. 
user1: Did you like the movie Jaws? I really don't like it.
user2: I think the introduction about Jaws is pretty accurate. 
user2: Jaws is a great movie. A classic. However I think we're supposed to use only the information given, as though we know nothing about it. 
user1: Oh, I'm sorry I meant I don't like this type of movies. Do you?
user2: Reading the reviews at left, it's not a movie I would rush out to see. I don't usually like "horror" movies.
user1: do you agree with the rating in rotten tomatoes?
user2: Yeah I think so. The movie was innovative. Nothing like that had ever been done before.
user1: Yea it's 1975, and people back thinks sharks attack human out of of the blue.
user1: then*
user1: I really don't enjoy watching that scene when a girl got pulled down to go skinny dipping.
user2: Yeah I don't agree that viewers don't feel sympathy for the shark's victims, that's for sure.
user2: I'm wondering when we get to move on to the next document.
user1: yea, I mean why would the coroner thinks she was killed by a boat accident
user2: I loved Robert Shaw, the shark hunter.
user1: Huh, a shark hunter. 
user1: didn't know he was a shark hunter
user1: I don't really blame the mayor proclaiming the beaches are safe.
user1: in that one scene
user2: Well he had to have the tourist traffic.
user1: I mean yea sure he cares about the money coming in, but sharks rarely do attack human. The whole plot of the story is a bit silly.
user2: The scene when the town hires Quint to go out and catch the shark is good. That is the first scene when you see him and he is a good character.
user1: So they hired a "shark hunter."
user1: So this Quint guy knows all about a shark? Why  can't they hire a shark specialist instead.
user2: Well they did hire the oceanographer also, and the two of them had funny interactions.
user2: They didn't exactly look at things from the same perspective.
user2: That last paragraph makes it sound really dumb.
user1: So the shark destroyed the cage? 
user1: I guess its not shark-proof cage after all
user2: Yes, I think so. The best part is when you don't actually see the shark itself.
user1: Hahha that is pretty intense man
user2: The shark was massive. It ate half the boat. 
user2: The shark itself was pretty fakey looking.
user1: Did the shark devoured Quint?
user2: Yep
user2: We're done, have a good one
user1: Oh rip

conversation:
user2: Jaws is a very good movie even though it is older!
user2: Jaws was made in 1975 and stars Roy Scheider.
user1: how was the horror element?
user2: It is scary but works because of the characters of the movie.
user1: that's cool
user2: I did not know it was from a novel wrote in 1974.  Did you?
user1: no I did not know that
user2: It was written by Peter Benchley.
user1: how's the acting
user2: I suppose the acting is good due to the direction of Steven Spielberg.
user1: does the shark do a lot of damage
user2: It starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean.
user2: Her name is chrissie Watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day.
user1: that sound scary
user1: what do they do about the shark
user2: I know.  Of course then the police chief wants to close the beach for safety but the mayor says no due to the tourist season and summer economy.
user2: What I can't believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to boat attack.
user1: wow what ashame
user2: The place a bounty on the shark after he attacks another person.
user1: did someone take it
user2: The local fisherman do catch a shark, a tiger shark. They assume that that's the killer shark.
user1: but i assume that the shark comes again
user2: Oh yeah, on the fourth of July it comes up and kills the police chief's son.
user2: Did you know that jaws is actually supposed to be a great white shark?
user1: that is intresting
user1: were they able to stop the shark
user2: I think one of the best scenes is when the police chief, the shark expert, and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter's boat, the Orca.  
user1: that sounds cool
user2: They finally do at the end.  They harpoon it while on the Orca but it get's away.
user2: It attacks the boat and eats the shark hunter.
user1: wow that must be scary
user2: Then the police chief stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into it's mouth and shoots the tank.
user1: thanks i will watch this movie
user2: You really should.
user1: bye
user2: bye

conversation:
user2: did you also watch the movie?
user2: did you also watched the movie?
user1: I did watch the movie. Did you know it was based on a novel?
user2: Ohh rweally I did not know that..
user1: If you watched the movie, what would you rate it on a 10 point scale?
user2: I liked the movie spielberg made this movie really good..
user2: probably about 8 rating..
user1: Who was your favorite character?
user2: how about you? 
user1: Yeah I'd probably say 8 as well. Favorite character was probably the guy who killed the shark.
user2: The girl loraine gary.. she made her role so well.. 
user1: Gotta look her up real fast. Do you agree with the critic responses?
user1: Haha if I recall right she had a good scream
user2: The movie was way to scary ahaha
user1: Hm so I guess we are to talk about these opening scenes.
user1: I thought it was an excellent opening that got to the point but also set the stage. Kind of had that feeling that oh these guys don't know what they are getting into.
user2: yeah ahaha.. 
user1: It also kind of plays on peoples' fear of sharks especially at night. Where just doing something for fun turns into a nightmare.
user2: weell at first the chiep police dont like to believes that thers a shark on the beach..
user2: yeah but I belive that sharks dont eat people they were just protecting their selves for as they thought intruders in their teritory..
user1: Oh yeah they thought it was a boating accident. Well probably didn't want to induce panic.
user1: Turns out it was a giant man eating shark after another dies.
user1: Yeah I wonder if this book/movie was sparked by shark attacks?
user2: yeahh.. I also think so.. I did not know who was the author of the novel 
user2: maybe he or she has a personal experienced or somewhat./.
user1: Says Peter Benchley. Dunno if he wrote any other novels based on the subject or if the movies took their own path
user2: ahh maybe spielberg added some sceens for the movie to be much more intence.
user1: Haha much more intense than this description.
user1: Kind of does the movie an injustice to pile it all into a couple paragraphs
user2: ahaha yes I believe so.. 
user1: What was your favorite section of the movie. Section 1, 2, or 3?
user2: I like the 3rd, It was the most Intence part of the movie for me, I think it is time for the for the sequel part 2 ahaha.. It was very long since then.. 
user1: Really was there no Jaws 2? Yeah I think the last part of the movie was the best as well. So much tension that had been built up.
user2: 1974 I was not born yet.. what if they do a Jaws now I think It was very much more intence and scary because of the HD now
user1: Yeah that is true that would be crazy. Kind of like how they redid Jurassic. I liked that other shark movie to with LL Cool J. Deep Blue I think. There's been one or two others but Jaws kind of set the bar and does probably deserve a remake.
user2: I think there's a jaw up to 4 I think ahaha.. 
user2: yes and the Lake Placid too ahaha.. ooppss off topic ahaha
user1: Hm forgot about that one. Anaconda was a good one.
user2: If they remake it it was very nice movie the jaws will look very natural 
user1: Yeah they could make a pretty awesome one. I wish the documents said how long the original was.
user2: a yeah I like thatr movie too I like the 1st movie much more
user2: way too long it was in 1975?
user2: ohh look we can finish the convey ahaha It was nice talking too you.. hope you have good more HITS too come...
user1: Haha yeah. It'd be cool to watch it and see the way people dress as well. YOu too nice chattin, take it easy.
user2: thanks.. take care

conversation:
user2: Well, I don't think I'm going to the beach anytime soon. 
user1: Oh it would be fun, just don't go in the water!
user2: I guess that's true, not any boats either! Do you think they'll make another one?
user1: They always seem to make more of movies like these. Will you go see it if they do?
user2: I think I'll wait until I can watch it at home. It's much less scary for me to watch scary movies like this cuddled up with a blanket. Steve nSpielberg is such a good director though. I would hope he would do the next one as well. 
user1: Yeah, he is a great director, I've seen a lot of his things. I agree on the watching it at home. The other people freaking out always makes it more scary for me though!
user1: I always liked Roy Schneider and Robert Shaw too though. I think they both did great in this one.
user2: I agree! It does add another level of fright to hear the others scream. Did you read the book before the movie came out?
user2: I haven't yet, but I wonder how well the movie followed the plot of the book.
user1: No. I didn't even realize there was a book. I am more of a movie person. Do you usually watch thrillers like this? Even if it is at home under the blanket?
user2: Yes. They are some of my favorites. There is something about the suspense. Like in the beginning of the movie when the girl skinny dipping gets pulled under... my heart was racing!
user1: Oh I know! I actually jumped and gasped and was like Get out of the water! They never listen though. That should teach you not to skinny dip in the ocean though
user1: What did you think of that mayor though? More concerned with money than people's safety when he had them change the death to a boat accident instead of the shark attack?
user2: Yup. Maybe if he had taken it seriously no one else would have been hurt. At least the shark hunter Quint offered her services, even though I think that was more for the cash than anything. 
user1: True, but then we wouldn't have gotten this awesome movie! As for Quint, it's always about the money isn't it? I think the bounty should have been higher then it was though. That was one dangerous shark.
user2: I agree. $10,000 isn't much money considering how many people had to die. I think Shaw was the perfect casting for Quint though.
user1: I agree, they had some great actors in this movie. That tooth that Hooper found in that half sunken ship was huge!
user2: Can you imagine stumbling across the body though!
user2: That's always a huge fear of mine, and I cringe every time it happens. 
user1: Yeah, finding a partial corpse like that would be quite a shock. How many people did that crazy shark kill? This movie gives Great whites such a bad name! Haha.
user2: I lost count. Yea, I'm not a huge shark fan now
user2: I can't believe Vaughn wouldn't just believe everyone that it could be a shark. 
user1: He just didn't want to close the beaches, he wanted that tourist money . I don't see how he could have denied it as long as he did.otherwise. He thinks closing the beach loses money? What about all of your visitors being eaten by a shark? That's not good either!
user2: I highly doubt the tourism would have been going that well with all the deaths.
user2: I can't believe Hooper got away when the shark destroyed that shark cage. I thought he was a goner for sure. 
user1: Ha! I know right, but that ending was awesome! Bye bye shark!
user2: The explosion was crazy!
user1: Yeah that ending was intense, I was on the edge of my eat. I wasn't sure how it was going to go for awhile
user1: edge of my seat, not eat. It was, and he had pretty good aim too to hit that tank
user2: He did! Good thing too, or they all would have died. 
user2: I can't wait for the next one!
user1: Yeah, sucks that Quint died though

user1: what is the movie rated?
user2: It has an IMDB rating of 8.0/10
user1: ok, i think i would like to see the movie
user1: are there other movies like this?
user2: Some critics would argue that it is a sensationally effective action picture a classic Steven Spielberg film
user1: did stephen spielberg win an award for the movie?
user2: I'm not sure. But in another key scene the beaches open for fourth of July despite warnings from Brody and Hooper that the shark is still on the loose.
user1: was this based on a true story at all?
user2: I don't know. You may google that if you're wondering.
user1: what else can you tell me about the movie?
user2: The mayor wants to keep the beaches open for tourist season even though there is evidence that the shark is still on the loose!
user1: it sounds very good, are there other movies like this at all?
user2: I do not know.  However, the boat in the movie is called Orca. In a critical scene, the shark attacks the boat and devours a main character however scuba gear saves the day... 
user1: are there any real sharks in the movie?
user2: I do not have information on that...However, the scuba tank saves the main character's life when it explodes in the shark's mouth!
user1: that sounds interesting for sure, is this out on blurray?
user2: I am not certain. But this movie is a thrilling adventure which some critics have compared the experience to shock therapy.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hi
user1: so what movie will you talk about
user2: Jaws 1975 thriller by Steven Spielberg
user1: ok how was it
user2: Great movie not for children but everyone watched it. About a man eating shark attacks beachgoers and the local police chiefs attempt to kill it
user1: wow was it scary
user2: It had its moments the music would get scary so yu knew and attack was going to happen
user1: that's cool how did they try to kill the shark
user2: Waiting for the shark was boring the it attacked the boat tearing it it got a scuba tank in its mouth and they shot at the tank and it blow up lucky because the boat was sinking 
user1: wow it must have been quite the scene
user2: yes
user1: thats cool so should i check this film out
user2: Yes, its available opening scene makes you not want to go alone to the beach 
user1: it must have been very bad
user2: yes without spoiling it too much
user1: how did the actors do in your opinion
user1: or the director
user2: They played real people Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody very concern with safety Robert Shaw as Quint was a real hunter type Richard Dreyfuss Biologist Matt Hooper helpful but not necessary Lorraine Gary as the chiefs wife Ellen Brody supportive 

conversation:
user1: hey
user1: i only just saw this movie last october
user1: i dont really like scary movies
user2: hey i like suspenseful movies so this was perfect
user1: I like how it says it was 'too gruesome for children'
user2: i was just reading that part too haha i disagree with that
user1: it says it was a lot like a woody allen flick? weird
user2: all the ratings are pretty high though, thats good
user1: The size doesn't seem consistent
user1: yeah
user1: I like the casting decisions
user2: yeah i agree
user1: Do we all really not feel sympathy for the shark's victims?
user1: i recall the boy at the beginning being pretty easy to feel bad for
user2: i think i sympathize easily with movie characters lol
user1: I always wondered how IMDB and rotten tomatoes can be so consistently off with their ratings
user1: dang this came out in 75 that was a lil bit ago
user2: i think rotten tomatoes is always harsh lol they're always lower than my opinion
user1: I dunno if i felt like a rat
user1: this definitely is just referencing initial audiences
user1: i could show this to a 6 year old and they'd be fine
user1: Coarse grained
user1: Some of these reviews are bad
user1: you gotta talk more to keep the exercise going my friend
user2: hey
user2: sorry i had to use the bathroom
user2: yeah exactly
user1: thats cool
user2: my younger nephew could watch it
user1: i just read "rob schneider"
user1: i was like umm no he wasn't in that
user2: LOL
user1: It was a tiger shark eh?
user1: oh wait that was a different shark
user1: i remember
user1: i have to look up estuary
user1: i wanna watch this again
user1: got any more comments?
user2: "refuses to close the beaches" always got me
user1: yeah
user1: lets just let everyone die
user1: there's a lot here i don't remember
user1: maybe i was drinking
user2: lol
user1: what do u rate this
user1: personally
user2: likea 7 or 8 
user1: i'd give it a 85 as it holds up today
user1: yeah
user1: kind of around the same
user2: right. compared to when it came out, like a 9 lol
user1: yeah
user1: it looked cooler back then i'm sure
user1: lets do some rapid fire chats now
user1: the timer is going down for me
user2: okay
user1: how many victims does jaws have?
user1: i don't remember being more than like 3
user2: i dont remember either

conversation:
user1: WHAT IS THE MOVIE CALLED?

user1: where does it take place?
user1: is it ok for kids to watch?
user2: It was said to be "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way".
user2: The movie takes place in a town called Amity Island.
user2: According to critics, Jaws is not for children.
user2: The producer is Steven Spielberg.
user1: thanks, I think I've made my decision
user2: Okay. Wonderful. Let me know if you want any more information about the movie.
user1: nope i think that;s good
user1: (isnt this supposed to be done after 12 exchanges? lol)
user2: (I'm not sure. I know 12 is the minimum but it said 20 minutes so many it counts down the time. Why don't I just tell you some more about the movie.)

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: You ever seen this movie before?
user1: hello! Yes I have, have you?
user1: It's one of my favorites.
user2: I have as well! but too scary for me lol
user2: The open water scenes would have my palms sweating
user1: I don't get that way, I love all the action scenes
user1: No other shark movies I've seen have compared to Jaws.
user1: I love how realistic Jaws looks compared to today's shark movies.
user2: Right! Jaws was revolutionary for its time. 
user2: If anyone says shark movie my mind immediately thinks JAWS! 
user1: The acting is amazing, too. Much more natural and authentic than copycat movies.
user1: It's crazy how the mayor puts all the people at risk  by keeping the beaches open despite knowing there was a shark attack.
user1: I'm not sure I would ever have the guts to be the guys hunting the shark, even for $10,000.
user2: Steven Spielburg is an amazing director.... but I KNOW! I just read that paragraph and am like.... that would never happen today
user2: I would! for 10000
user2: I would do things that would be considered sin in some religons
user1: That's nuts! lol
user1: The scene where the girl at the beginning is in the ocean is so eerie. 
user2: 10,000 back in 1975 is like 30,000 today lol I would jump on that so fast... i also kinda want to be a hero one day
user2: the scene with the dead body got me
user1: Oh gosh I know, a fright to see for sure.
user2: I was so scared when he dropped the tooth cause thats when you know shit got real
user2: like they both realized at that moment, a shark took down a boat
user1: That mayor is an idiot. The people just believed everything he said though, it was a shame.
user2: I mean if it was like the mayor of cape cod I would be reluctant to close the beaches
user2: thats like 100% of the towns money
user1: It was a huge weekend for visitors so I could understand his hesitation, but what a scum bag for putting lives at risk.
user2: tru tru
user2: wow the irony that the boat was named orca
user2: if i was high watching that i would have been like whoo
user1: When he went under in that cage it was truly terrifying. After almost getting eaten, I don't think I could continue to hunt it like they did.
user1: It was sad when Quint died, that was unexpected.
user2: yeah poor old man :(
user2: didnt stand a chance
user1: But it ended up with a happy ending by them killing Jaws (in such a graphic way)
user2: it was the only option lol it had to be done 
user2: glad they were able to wrap the movie up like that
user1: When the barrels would disappear under water it left you with so much fear of what was going to happen.
user2: thats supense for ya
user1: Yep. And Chief Roy paddling back was kind of crazy being that he's in such a big ocean.
user2: i was just typing that!!
user2: they were just chillin in open water
user2: what if there were two sharks!
user1: I meant Chief Brody lol
user1: Yes my thoughts exactly. How were they to know if there weren't more like Jaws out there?
user1: Steven Spielberg really did an amazing job on this one.

conversation:
user2: Hi
user2: Hello
user1: Hi, I am reading the document. One moment please
user1: Ok, hi! I just finished reading. The movie is Jaws. Have you seen it?
user1: Jaws
user2: You are right.
user1: Right about what?
user2: I have seen it very good movie
user2: Just amazing
user1: Ah, ok. Good! I would like to watch it again soon. I love Steven Spielberg and thriller movies. I also like how there is some comedy in it as well.
user1: The director is so good that most of the scariest parts are when we don't even see the shark.
user2: Yes
user1: I think Jaws is a bit too gruesome for children, but good for adults. Do you watch it more than once?
user2: Yes
user1: I think you probably have to answer more than just yes to get paid haha
user1: This movie has great characters I believe
user2: Yes great.
user1: ok, this isn't really a discussion and you are giving me nothing here, so I am aborting the conversation. have a great day

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi
user1: I've never actually seen Jaws
user1: I don't like scary movies.
user2: i have but not in a long time
user2: i dont know if id call it scary..
user1: What did you think about it?
user2: it was good but pretty retro
user2: i think it could use a modern day re-vamp
user1: It got good reviews.
user1: Be interesting to see what a modern day one would get with modern special effects
user2: yah thats what i was thinking
user1: obviously it was good at the time considering what the reviews say
user2: yah i feel like rotten tomatoes is usually a pretty harsh judge but jaws scored pretty high
user1: yeah 97 that's amazing
user2: i surprised the reviews put some much emphasis on the movie as being a "scary movie"
user1: see that bit about the key scene they just added?
user1: yeah that's what I mean! it's probably scary.
user2: umm hang on
user2: my document is reloading
user1: has it loaded? 
user2: yah i just finished reading it
user1: the scenes they're describing are pretty gruesome.
user1: and it's not like a lot of scary movies where it could actually sort of happen!
user2: i mean it is a shark attack...
user1: do you like other scary movies?
user2: yah thats very true!
user2: yah but not when they are overly corny
user1: maybe that's why you don't think jaws is scary!
user2: yah and i think that being an older movie it just can't compete with some of the more extreme titles that modern day films offer
user1: yeah that's probably true
user1: according to that last key scene though, they triumph over the shark which i guess means its kind of a happy ending!
user1: they kill the shark anyways
user2: haha i guess thats one way to put it
user2: that scene was pretty epic
user1: it sounds like it from the description
user2: yah i think thats the only part in the movie i really remember
user1: was that your favorite part?
user2: id have to say the end 
user2: just because there was so much action
user1: yeah i'm not a big fan of those types of scenes.
user1: doesn't seem like this movie is for me!
user2: yah im not usually in love with people destroying the oceans but its the only part of the film that really stuck with me
user2: bye!

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello 
user2: So have you seen jaws?
user1: I have not, shockingly. 
user2: Really? I think you are one of the first people I've spoken to that hasn't.
user2: Do you like sharks?
user1: Haha, figured. I do not, I'm terrified. 
user2: Then yeah, don't watch it.
user1: Makes sense. 
user2: It's not so much the shark but leading up to the attack that gets you lol
user2: The musical score haunts you.
user1: I'm sure, haha. I'm fimilar with the music. 
user2: I think for it's was the special effects were great.
user2: Sorry it's hard to discuss and ask questions lol
user2: I wonder why we never did feel sympathy for any of the victims?
user2: I remember the first time I watched it. It gives you irrational fears lol
user2: Are you still here?
user2: Do you like Spielberg?
user2: Hello?
user2: Ok I think you've left me hanging. Nice chatting.

conversation:
user2: This movie seems to have a really good rating.
user2: I really liked the movie because it was interesting and thrilling and very unique.
user1: The movie is scary, but I think I would like it
user2: I didn't know it was based on a novel. I think it would be an interesting read if it was anything like the movie.
user2: What do you think about them choosing a great white shark to be Jaws?
user1: It gives Great Whites a bad rep
user1: Even the reviews are mixed
user1: I would probably rather watch the movie than read the novel though
user1: I don't feel that way about all movies, but I think I would about this one.
user2: I wonder if it is a lot like the movie, or if they've changed a lot of things.
user1: I would think that they had to cut a lot of extra scenes/dialogue to make the film.
user2: I think there is a lot of stuff you can get from the movie though that you can't get from the book. Like the tension, and how scary some parts are even when the shark isnt seen.
user1: That's true. And the characters might appeal to you more.
user2: By the way, do you think it's weird that it's the police chief that is hunting the shark? I mean I know there is a marine biologist, and a professional shark hunter, but I wonder why the police chief is helping.
user1: To keep death rates low I guess. I'm not sure who would help in that situation anyway.
user2: The first girl that dies in the movie, the one that was skinny dipping, how can anyone believe she died from a boating accident.
user1: Well the judge ruled it, so maybe he kept the witnesses quiet.
user2: It seems like he cared more about the towns reputation than keeping people safe. Which if there are a bunch of people dying in your town, wouldn't that run the reputation too? 
user2: Also, would an oceanographer really know how to tell / be able to confirm that someone died from a shark attack?
user1: I agree.
user1: The oceanographer might know what a sharks bite looks like, based on jaw and teeth dental records
user2: True, if he's familiar enough with a great white he could make an educated guess. They knew it wasn't a tiger shark just based on the tooth they found.
user2: Quint, the professional shark hunter, is my favorite character.
user1: I wonder why Vaughn was devastated, if people keep telling you these attacks are from something else, why would you be surprised when another attack happens? He is my least favorite character.
user2: I agree. He may have been in denial since he was hoping it wouldn't effect the town's summer economy. Especially since they had a lot of tourists on the Fourth of July. Maybe he thought it was an isolated incident.
user2: Especially having people pulling pranks. He may have thought it wasn't that big of a deal.
user1: Having a chance that there is a large predator out there and having many people come to the beach at once was a disaster waiting to happen.
user2: I agree. He doesn't seem like a very good mayor.
user1: Oh noooo Quint died
user2: Yeah, that part bummed me out. He was such a good character.
user1: He was. But his work was worth it since they managed to kill the real culprit.
user2: I think it's weird though that the police chief was one of the characters to live, even though he wasn't a professional shark hunter or oceanographer or anything like that.
user1: He got to live because he probably stayed away from the water. Maybe even though he pretended like the claims were wrong, he knew it deep inside.
user2: True. When Hooper got into the water in a cage Jaws nearly killed him. 
user1: Hooper was really brave, I wouldn't have gone in the water even with a cage.
user2: I wouldn't have either.
user2: I think the scene where Brody is laying down a chum like and the shark just appears behind the boat is a really good and iconic scene.
user1: Brody also did some quick thinking, using the scuba tank.

conversation:
user2: Jaws is a scary thriller by spielberg.
user2: DO you agree?
user1: I do. It's also near universally acclaimed with that rating of 97%.
user2: It is about a fictional town
user1: Yes. Set in New England, but beyond that the specific setting isn't real.
user2: A giant great while man eating shark is the threat.
user1: The shark is opposed mostly by the local police chief, a shark hunter, and an oceanographer.
user2: Do you think it is a good movie for children?
user1: I saw it at a young age and it didn't do me any harm. Some critics clearly disagree, though.
user2: yes
user1: I also thoroughly enjoyed it even back then.
user2: A memorable scene is when a woman goes skinny dipping and is pulled under the water
user1: Yes, that's the opener, if I'm not mistaken. 
user1: It's based on a novel that only came out shortly before the film.
user2: OK
user2: Some thought it was a boating accident
user2: it is a great example of speilbergs ability
user1: It is, and also was early in his career. Maybe his 3rd film in fact which for him is super early.
user2: yes
user2: i think it is from 1975
user1: It is. Based on Peter Benchley's novel. Murray Hamilton is the mayor. A significant role, though not as big as Scheider/Dreyfuss/Shaw's parts.
user2: Amity island is the name of the fictonal town
user1: At one point, a tiger shark that's caught is mistakenly thought to be the culprit.
user2: roy shnider plays brody the poilice chief
user1: Richard Dreyfuss is Mat Hooper, the oceanographer that accompanies him.
user2: the mayor doesnt want to close the beaches initially
user1: He's concerned that closing them would result in less tourism, which isn't good for revenue in his eyes.
user2: the tiger shark has no human remains
user2: the name of quints boat is the orca
user1: When they realize that, they investigate and find a great white's tooth that makes them realize it's probably the real threat.
user2: they use the boat to hunt the shark
user2: they use a chum line to bait the shark
user1: They try firing a barrel into it, but the shark just takes it down with it, unharmed.
user2: they try to harpoon it with a barrel attached
user1: The Orca starts sinking after that.
user2: the boat then slowly sinks
user1: Hooper makes an attempt at it in a sharkproof cage later.
user2: they are trapped on the boat while it sinks
user2: he tries to inject the shark with a hypodermic spear
user1: The shark wrecks the cage, but Hooper manages to get away.
user2: the shark gets a scuba tank in the mouth
user1: Brody stuffed the tank in the shark's mouth, and uses Quint's rifle to shoot it.
user2: it explodes killing the shark.
user1: After that, Hooper resurfaces unharmed!
user2: yea!
user1: They paddle toward the coast on a fragment of the Orca.
user2: what an ending
user1: I never forgot the final shot of it with them approaching Amity Island.
user2: this movie probably made many people afraid of the water
user1: It definitely did for a while. The scare could've lasted months or even years.
user2: I think Im done 
user1: It does seem like we've hit the last page here.
user2: OK bye
user1: Bye

conversation:
user1: Now I am very scared of sharks
user2: hi 
user2: mee too 
user2: are you there
user1: Spielberg did an excellent job with this movie
user1: yes
user2: yes i appreciate 
user1: Did you like Robert Shaw's acting?
user2: very much 
user2: you are like very think so 
user1: I didn't understand that sorry
user2: that movie is little confusing 
user1: What was confusing about it?
user2: that story 
user2: i was scared 
user1: me too!
user2: shark is very dangerous 
user1: yes they are
user1: They all thought the tiger shark was the bad guy
user2: were you watch saw movie
user1: in the theater
user2: not only pirana is also bad 
user1: were there pirana in the movie?
user1: I thought only sharks
user2: just talking about that 
user1: It was scary when the shark ate the woman
user2: all the people scare by the shark 
user1: I'm not sure what's going on here I've replied 12 times
user2: we want a little chat more 
user1: Ok there was a great deal of blood in this movie\
user2: ohh 
user2: then 

conversation:
user1: Hello there! What did you think of the movie "Jaws"?
user2: I personally love that movie! It's one of my all time favorites!
user1: Agreed! Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB and Metacritics loved it as well! Can't disagree with them!
user1: Who was your favorite character in the film?
user2: That's definitely true. I liked Chief Martin Brody. It's interesting to see him react to the whole situation and how he feels slowly.
user1: He was my favorite as well. Of course, I loved Quin also. The cast did such an excellent job! I had no idea the movie was based on a book released in 1974! 
user2: The entire cast was great really! I agree with the analysis of how effective Spielberg's direction was.
user1: So true! He's a brilliant director and this was the best thriller I believe I've ever seen!
user1: I didn't know Amity Island was a fictional New England resort town either!
user2: I do think he truly managed to make the camera "be the shark" rather than showing the shark all the time.
user2: Amity Island seemed so much like it could be any small town with real problems.
user1: I agree. As one critic note, "Spielberg is blessed with talent".  Truer words have never been spoken!
user1: The beach party scene where Chrissie goes skinny dipping was so freaky!
user2: Yes it's amazing how much talent he has and I believe he was mostly self taught.
user2: Also I think it's very true how we don't really feel for the victims very much...
user1: Agreed. Brody had every right to close those beaches. It's too bad greed forced the Mayor to overrule him. 
user2: Yes, that is very true. Brody did really care for the public. I wish more public officials cared like that.
user1: I know what you mean. So do you feel Quin Charing only 10000 was a bit too low, given the circumstances?
user2: It seemed somewhat low but at the same time I think he did really try to do the best with a bad situation.
user1: Agree. I felt bad for Body's son after he witnessed that boater get devoured.
user2: Oh yeah that would really upset anybody. Especially when your father should have power to help but doesn't.
user1: Definitely. And it all could have been prevented had the Mayor listened to Hooper after saying the beaches were safe when the tiger shark was caught.
user2: Yes that's the worst part of the whole situation for them just how unresponsive the mayor really was.
user1: Very true. So I wonder if the great white tooth Hooper found in the hull was actually a real life tooth?
user2: Spielberg always loved going for realism so I bet it really was!
user1: I know! So what did you think of Quinn's death? It was disturbing I thought!
user2: It was probably one of the most upsetting deaths in the movie. He was a character that we got to know and suddenly he was dead.
user1: So true! Quint was my second favorite character behind Brody, so it was sad! Robert Shaw did a magnificent job portraying Quint.
user2: Yes he was a great actor and got emotions across very well in all of his scenes. I think he could have been slightly more prominent though.
user1: True! I did love how Brody killed the shark. Shoving thr scuba tank into its mouth and shooting it from high above was genius!
user2: Yeah that was a super creative plan that thankfully worked. It was kind of funny to see how it went down.
user1: I agree! It was! And of course, the ending with Hooper and Brodie
user1: Seeing them paddle toward the island was a fitting ending in my opinion. 
user2: Yes I remember that image so well! It really stuck with me. They're happy but then they're still kind of just stuck there.
user1: And having to use boat wreckage to cling onto. So fitting!
user1: It's truly a masterpiece and that speaks volumes considering it was released in 1975!
user2: Yes that is very true. It's impressive how much it's just stayed a classic for all of these years!
user1: And I must say, I also thought Quint's boat being named the Orca was ironic.
user2: Yes I believe that's specifically why they came up with that name! Everything had a real prupsoe.
user1: So true!  And the suspense grew as the ship started sinking!
user2: Yes that was another of those really classic moments that you can never forget!
user1: Agreed! Well, stranger, I think this about wraps things up for us. I enjoyed our conversation! Have a great evening and i wish you and yours all the best!
user2: Thank you! It was great to talk about such an enjoyable movie.
user1: I had fun and thoroughly enjoyed it! Take care, my friend!

user1: how do you feel about the movie jaws by steven speilberg?
user2: I think it's a great watch 
user1: Same here. Spielberg was really blessed with natural talent for directing movies. he really knows how to tell astory on screen
user2: What is your favorite scene in Jaws?
user1: "Youre gonna need a bigger boat" lol
user1: probably one of my favorite lines from the movie
user1: Spielberg has a great way of bringing comedy into his films
user2: lol
user1: really complex and well developed characters, we can also thank the great cast for that
user2: Have you had a chance to read the novel?
user1: I actually have not sadly. I dont get much time to read now adays. 
user1: I assume its fantastic though
user2: characters are simply functions of the action  
user2: I love this key scene
user2: 10 k for his the shark 
user2: that's alot in the old days 
user1: LOL, yeah, 10000 is nothing today. I could spend that paying off a traffic ticket! I like chrissy watkins skinny dipping lol. Call me a perv
user2: your funny 
user2: tickets I hate those !
user1: Thank god, i havnt had one for a while. Cops are like sharks kinda. Sitting there just waiting to bite your legs off. Metaphorically of course, it cost my right leg the last time i was pulled over for speeding
user2: who is your favorite character? 
user2: can you guess mine?
user1: Martin Brody?
user2: haha arm and a leg xD
user1: That was mine

conversation:
user1: Jaws seems like a suspenseful movie.
user2: yes very thirll
user2: the director direct move very perfectly 
user1: directed by spielberg, he has done some great work.
user2: this film based on peter benchly's novel
user2: in the novel gaint man eating, here share attack
user2: Roy scheider as chief martin braddy
user2: sensationally effective action and thriller film
user2: this film particularly sympathy for any of the shark's victims

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello! How did you enjoy Jaws?
user2: I loved it
user2: It was great, and the premise was realistic to it scared a lot of people
user1: Me too. You could already tell then Spielberg was going to be a great director.
user1: Yes definitely not for kids!
user1: Richard Dreyfuss was great as well.
user2: everytime I see Richard Dreyfuss I laugh, even in serious roles like this
user2: I like his mannerisms are funny
user2: I think*
user1: Yes he usually gets that kind of reaction.
user2: do you like thrillers?
user1: I do if they have a sense of humor to them as well, like this one.
user2: I think we just got more information on the movie
user2: do you swim or surf
user1: I remember that skinny dipping scene. That was quite exciting for me as a kid haha.
user2: lol
user1: I do both. I used to live in Hawaii.
user1: I wasn't scared of sharks though.
user1: Even though you're aware of them.
user2: yea I'm always aware but I think the odds are similar to getting struck by lightening so
user1: Unlike this movie though, whenever there was a shark sighting the beaches did get closed right away.
user1: Tiger sharks are the kind most prevalent in Hawaii.
user2: yea they are the real man eaters
user1: It would be rare actually to find both kinds of sharks in the same waters. Great Whites prefer cold, Tigers warm.
user2: you should have been the marine biologist in the movie!
user1: That scene was silly because a Great White would not have gone into a shallow estuary like that. He probably wouldn't have even fit!
user1: Haha but then we wouldn't have had Richard Dreyfuss.
user2: but I think a shark as man-hungry as jaws would have squirmed his way in
user1: True good point.
user2: do you think a shark really could demolish a cage the way jaws did
user1: That was frightening when he ripped that cage open!
user1: I think the shark would not have done that.
user1: He was already well fed from eating all the people before that.
user2: yea, being a little kid at the time I believed every second and was scared to swim in the ocean tho
user1: Everyone was!
user2: Why would jaws like eating people?
user1: Sharks don't like eating people at all. Most bites are because they confuse us for seals or turtles.
user2: but jaws liked eating people
user1: That was an awesome scene when they blew him up!
user1: I remember everyone cheering in the theater.
user2: yea, one of the greats in cinema
user2: ka-boom
user1: Even though the special effects look silly now, it still holds up as great cinema.
user2: yea it looks really silly nowadays 
user2: but will always remain as one of the greats
user1: I wonder who the 13% of people were that didn't like it.

conversation:
user1: Hi what did you like the most about Jaws ?
user2: I liked the concept about an animal striking back.
user1: Yeah, it was very frightening, even when we can't see it. Do you think it was too gruesome ? 
user2: Honestly, I did somewhat mostly because it seemed so much more real especially movies w/o all the graphics they have today.
user1: It is because Spielberg is a talent filmmaker. Which actor did you like ?
user2: I liked Robert Shaw.
user2: Is the second document loading for you?
user1: I did like Robert Dreyfus.  Did you feel any empty for the victims ?
user1: No
user1: I think we have to exchange 12 times about the film
user2: Yes, you are right I think. Knowing that it was movie made me feel less empathy.
user1: Do you think the scene where they examine the remains is too gory ?
user1: I think it was unnecessary
user2: Yes this scene undoubtedly made me afraid to swim with the sharks. (Side note: There was no timer clock on my end, I think we were suppose to wait since this is no 1)
user2: Which was your favorite actor?
user1: My favorite actor was Richard Dreyfuss, I liked his performance as a marine biologist. and you ?  
user2: My favorite was Robert Shaw. Do you think the mayor should not overruled the shark attack? Perhaps many lives could have been saved.
user1: It would just have precipitated the shark hunt. It would had saved 1 life. I think offering 10 000 $ was too much and attracted  many people who should not have been  there.
user2: Yes, $10,000 back then was a lot of money. I just think the mayor cared more about tourism revenue. 
user1: You are right, another proof is the re-opening of the beaches after they caught the tiger shark. Even if there was no human remains in it.   
user2: Yes, he was quick to assume that was the shark w/o considering there are more sharks in the ocean.
user2: Do you like thriller movies like Jaws?
user1: Yeah, I like the fact that is really efficient. How do you appreciate Spielberg work in this film ? 
user2: I think Spielberg for time was genius. The scene where the boater was killed and the shark approached the beach was very scary!
user2: Do you think they should have hired Quint sooner or not at all?
user1: I think we can see his genius on how he shows us how strong the shark is without show it to us. Just by showing one big tooth, he creates a lots of tension. 
user2: I don't think it would have mattered considering Quint's fate. Did you find when Hooper went into the water and the sharked destroyed the cage super scary?
user1: Yeah, it is only in the end the we can measure the strength of the shark. It destroyed a steel cage, something it never has done before. It is very effective. 
user1: Do you think Quint's death was necessary ?
user2: Yes, very strong shark. I am firm believer in karma and I believe Quint in some sort of twisted way died the way he should have. He hunted them and he was hunted. What do you think?
user1: Yes, it would not have been a satisfying  ending if Quint would have killed the shark. The others would have looked less courageous. 
user1: What you think of the behavior of the others ?
user2: Very true. I am happy that the explosion did kill the shark. I think it was a creative way to kill the shark with what they had.  I think the others were courageous but I was surprised Brody was with.
user2: Do you think Brody should have came with them?
user1: I think it is to give a sense of an happy ending. Without Brody, Hopper would be alone, it would be somewhat darker. Would you have liked a darker ending ?
user2: No. I wouldn't have wanted them to get killed. Do you agree with the overall ratings of this film?
user2: I think the ratings are fair and I believe we have met the requirements for the conversation.
user1: I agree with IMDB, 8/10 but not more. The fi
user1: The film was great but not a classic
user1: What do you think of the ratings ?
user2: I think they were on the high side. I agree the movie was great but definitely not a classic. Do you generally like thrillers? (If we have met the requirements, it was really nice chatting with you)
user2: I noticed the finish conversation button appeared.
user1: Thanks have a good evening. I like thrillers, but I have seen too much of them, I am not longer easily scared.
user2: Me too, thank you have a good evening too. 

conversation:
user2: Jaws might very well be the best shark attack movie in history.
user1: I agree, it was ahead of it's time.
user1: Did you like the other Jaws movies?
user2: I think Spielberg did a great job building up the suspense.
user2: I remember liking the one where they were at Sea World
user1: Yeah, it kept wondering what was going to happen next.
user2: Do you think it is suitable for kids? i watched it when i was like 6 years old.
user1: I think it's too violent for kids.
user1: Do you think it should be rated R?
user2: Didn't stop my parents from letting me watching it. lol
user2: definately should be rated r
user2: why do most scary movies that involve water involve someone going skinny dipping?

conversation:
user1: Hello.  How are you today?
user2: hey! Im good. Thanks and you
user1: I am well,  Have you ever seen the movie Jaws?
user2: Can you tell me more about the movie we need to discuss
user2: I have when I was little
user1: Absloutely.  It is about a large Great White shark who ends up off the coast in New England and he eats people.  :)
user1: Made me scared to go swimming for a long time.  LOL.  It was Steven Spielberg's first big movie.
user2: That definitely seems like I remember. I recall being scared
user2: Great production and cast for the time it was filmed
user2: great makeup and effects given the tech at the time
user1: I have heard that the novel was very good, but I never read it.
user2: Never read it either, did not know it was based on a novel.
user1: There is this great scene where they think the first victim was killed by a boat but this shark hunter says "no and offers to get the shark for $10000.
user1: The mayor wants to pretend nothing is happening.
user2: Yeah I remember that scene. it was great. 
user2: I guess people want to deny what they cant control
user1: It really is.  Robert Shaw who plays "Quint" the shark hunter is incredible.  
user1: You are right it is easier to deny that to accept.
user2: Yeah, definitely one of the american classics
user2: I really like the setting and the cinematography
user1: There is another great scene where some fisherman claim to have found the shark--it is not the great white though.  Richard Dreyfuss is in it and he is the one who finds a shark tooth in the hull of another ship.
user2: definitely deserved the oscars it got
user1: Absolutely.  Still scary.
user2: Yeah, I know, I dont know if I would do if I was close to a great white
user1: Me niether.  The scene where Quint gets eaten by the shark is incredible.
user2: Definitely, gore and suspense. Awesome!
user2: and scary of course
user1: He still tries to fight it.  How can you beat a Great White?
user2: Definitely not by punching it
user1: It is gory especially for a big film like that.  No.  Punching will not work.  LOL.
user1: It was nice speaking to you today.
user2: Same here, thanks!

conversation:
user1: What's the title of the movie?
user2: Jaws
user1: Have you seen it before?
user2: Steven Speilberg did an amazing job directing.
user2: Yes I have.
user1: Me too. It's been a while though.
user1: The acting was amazing,
user2: I man eating shark has always been a fear of mine.
user1: Me too. Anytime I sit in a boat my brain just starts playing the Jaws theme.
user2: Didn't you think Roy Scheider did an amazing job as chief Brody?
user1: Yeah, his acting was really believable.
user1: Have you watched any of the other Jaws movies?
user2: Oh and the scene where the skinny dipping woman was pulled under, it is one of those never forget movie moments.
user2: No not since the original.
user1: Yeah that scene is definitely meant to be burned in a movie watcher's brain.
user2: The funniest part is it was the most cheerful scary movie ever.
user1: And you should try watching Jaws 2. I'd argue that it's even better than the first movie, though it's a bit slow at the beginning.
user1: And yeah, I was surprised at how upbeat it was for a movie about man eating sharks.
user2: I love how real it is portrayed. I can totally see govn people lying to keep a beach open at the holiday.
user2: To say they caught the shark even though no remains were found in it.
user1: Yeah, stuff like that happens all the time. They're people who'd say or do anything if it meant they could get more money.
user2: I always felt bad for Brody's son Micheal in the movie, he was tortured by the events. 
user1: Yeah, if you ever get around to watching the sequels, you can really see how traumatized he is by everything that happened.
user2: Major Larry was such a jerk.
user2: I will have to try them.
user2: I will never understand the boat they took Orca to hunt the shark.  It never seemed adequate. 
user1: You should absolutely watch Jaws 2, but Jaws 3 made me root for the sharks.
user2: And I will never understand why Hopper went into that shark cage.
user1: Exactly! That boat looked like it would split into 2  if a butterfly landed on it.
user1: And I guess people like Hopper love the thrill, but I'd never be able to go into a rusty looking shark cage like that.
user2: Still one of my favorite bad guy death seens, the scuba tank in the sharks mouth boom.
user2: Never, I rather never go swimming again then get into that cage.
user1: That was really clever. If I was about to get eaten by a shark I wouldn't be able to think anything other than AAAAAAAH!
user2: I would have been in a total panic paddling back to Amity.  Wouldn't have cared if I saw the shark die I would be worried about others.
user2:  HAHA AAAAAAHHHHHH is right.
user1: It's good that he kept his cool. I'd probably die of a heart attack before the shark even opened its mouth.
user2: Hooper was certainly the lucky dog though.
user1: Yup
user2: Was Chief Brody in the next movie.
user2: It is funny having my kids watch it, they look and say what awful affects, but for that time it was amazing.
user1: Yeah, and honestly everyone in the town would probably be shark food if not for the Chief.
user2: Was Major Larry in the next one as well?
user1: And I'm pretty young, but I can still appreciate that the effects were good for its time.
user2: They critiqued it as too gruesome for any aged children back then, haha kids now would chuckle compared to what they see now.
user1: Yeah, he comes back for the sequel.
user2: Hard to believe it was created in 1975, didn't know it was done that long before I was born.
user1: I'm surprised that kids today aren't scarred for life with some of the shows they somehow watch(probably behind their parents' backs).
user2: Ya know.
user1: Yeah it looks pretty good for a movie that's over 40 years old.
user2: Absolutely, I have certainly seen worse.
user2: Woody Allen has been killing the movie biz for a long time.
user1: Yeah, and he's still going
user1: I think he played a character in Antz, but I haven't seen that movie since kindergarten, so my memory's a bit fuzzy.
user2: The directing was amazing, to say that some of the scariest parts where scenes that you could even see the shark is impressive.
user1: It really was! I love it when movies can scare you without having to resort to cheap jumpscares.
user2: Absolutely just organic scares and thrills.
user1: It's been fun taking with you! But I gotta go get stuff done. Bye!

conversation:
user1: Do you like Jaws?
user1: Do you like Robert Shaw as Quint?
user2: Yes of course it had got a 97% average.
user1: Who is your favorite character?
user1: It came out in 1975. That was a long time ago.
user2: Robert Shaw
user2: Yes that's too long.
user1: Steven Spielberg did a great job on that film.
user2: A giant man had ate the great white shark attacks
user2: Yes he has directed the movie very well.
user1: I bet the Peter Benchley novel is great too.
user2: Of course
user1: Do you have a favorite part of the movie?
user2: I like the white shark attacks part of the movie.
user1: That is the whole movie. Have you really seen it?
user2: Not but I have read about it.
user1: You should check it out
user2: Yes definitely, the story is quite interesting.
user1: It is. It's the first real blockbuster movie.
user2: Of really?
user1: Yes
user2: Did you saw the Chrissie Watkins scene?
user1: Do you like Richard Dreyfus?
user1: Yes, that is the beginning right?
user2: Yeh
user1: That is really scary
user2: Her remains scene is really scary.
user1: I like when they all set out on Quint's boat
user2: How badly the Shark would have attack her
user1: Very badly
user1: I am having trouble with your sentences. They are hard to understand.
user1: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user2: Yes of course
user2: IMDB rating were 8/10
user1: Do you generally watch movies like this?
user2: Yes I do

conversation:
user1: Hey, let's talk about Jaws
user2: Yes i think Roy Schneider was a good fit for Chief Martin
user1: You are right. I don't think anyone else could have played the role as well. The entire cast was great.
user1: Who was your favorite actor in the movie?
user2: Roy Scheider he had a great persona for the role he played
user2: Do you think the shark looked better being real than CGI?
user1: I agree. I am partial to Richard Dreyfuss as Matt, but I am a fan of his in general. 
user1: At the time it was made I think the shark was perfect and it was realistic. If it had been remade today with the new technology, I feel like CGI in combination with the animatronic would look best.
user2: I never knew the movie was based on a novel of the same name
user1: I didn't either, but that makes sense. Do you think it was one of Spielberg's best films?
user2: One of? yes i do think it is one of his best films. Because the way it's directed makes it so memorable 
user2: The movie is in the Thriller Genre but it feels more like an Action or drama do you agree?
user1: I do think it seems more like action than thriller, but I suppose genres were defined differently back then. 
user1: I saw a documentary about Spielberg and he said that he wouldn't make the movie as gruesome if he did it present day. That after he had children of his own, he hasn't wanted to put children being harmed in his movies like back then. 
user2: your right the movie is rated PG but i get the feeling it would be rated higher than that by todays standards 
user1: Most certainly, PG13 at the very least. 
user2: The part where Roy is trapped in the sinking Orca is the best part i think because of the suspense what about you?
user1: Honestly, it's been so many years since I rewatched it that I don't remember it well enough to recall the suspense I felt during that scene. The Amity Island scene has to be the most memorable in the movie to me, aside from Jaws jumping onto the boat to get Quint. 
user2: The most memorable thing about the JAWs franchise was the terrible Nintendo game made by LJN. I remember playing that as a kid and getting very angry.

conversation:
user1: Hi there what movie are you watching?
user2: Hello did you get to see the movie called Jaws which was directed by Steven Spielburg?
user1: Ive seen it years ago, but im sure I dont really remember what it was about

conversation:
user1: So how did you feel about the Jaws movie
user2: This looks like an exciting film, but the reviews are diverse
user2: Some say that you just can't sympathize with the characters who are attacked
user1: Why not?
user2: They say it's like they;'re just props, I suppose for the star of the show, which is obviously the shark. Not relevant to the action. 
user2: What input do you get?
user1: But it's a thriller genre movie. And the shark is a man-eating great white shark who attacks beachgoers
user1: I feel that's enough sympathy for the characters who just wanted to go to the beach but got attacked
user2: I agree. Like one critic says that it's a movie that populated with human beings - I think we can all relate to that, hmm?
user1: It's true a critic responded saying the characters are props to deliver a story but just because it's meant to deliver a story, you should still feel sympathy. imagine this happened off screen
user2: That's exactly it - why watch a movie unless you can imagine it happening on some level? Like one critic says, it's too gruesome for children. Why? Because they can imagine it happening, obviously.
user2: And all of the major internet movie sites love it if you go by their rankings, even Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 9.2  
user1: I can't believe it got such a high rating
user1: Sure it's a thriller type movie to give the audience a scare but the feedback of the ratings are incredible. I would have thought a scaring film like this would get more negative feedback instead
user2: Me too. I also didn't know that it was originally a novel! The book came out in 1974 and by 1975 they already had the movie!
user1: then again, I guess the audience know what theyre going in for so it's enjoyable to them
user1: In a short amount of time, the book must have been quite popular
user2: I thought that too, by the way - how many thrill rides are there out there in movieland? But I guess what made this stand out was maybe it's kind of humoristic element? One critic even compares it to a Woody Allen movie.
user1: And to depict the essence of the novel in a movie with a shark prop couldn't have been easy
user1: What do you think of the scenes in the movie?
user2: True, everything seems to play off that shark, too - it's set on a beach, there's a sharkhunter involved, an oceanographer - who ever hears of these professions much in the real world?
user2: Well, the scenes that it describes sound pretty emotionally devastating - I mean, it says that the police chief's son goes into shock when a boater is killed, and one of the characters sees a partial corpse. Don't know if I'd like that.
user1: And to believe a critic said we shouldn't try to feel any particular sympathy for for the shark's victims. how would that even be possible. it's like telling a person to be cold blooded and not care

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: hi
user1: Hey
user2: do you like the movie?
user1: I liked Jaws, it was directed by Steven Spielberg.
user2: yes
user2: "scare machine" that is a good review
user1: Yes, that is a good review.
user2: Steven Spielberg is good, isn't he?
user1: It is based on a novel as well.
user2: it is a thriller for sure
user1: It also had great reviews, it was a well reviewed movie.
user1: The beach party scene really sets the mood.
user2: "funny in a Woody Allen way"
user2: that I did not expect
user2: yeah psycho beach party
user1: The bounty on the shark was kind of weird, it made regular people go after it.
user2: bounty hunting for shark.
user1: Yes, that whole thing could have been avoided.
user2: indeed
user1: That tiger shark part was funny since they had no idea.
user2: Yeah
user2: Great white shark
user1: Vaughn sure looked foolish.
user2: indeed he did
user2: poor guy
user1: Yes really, also sad about Micheal and Brody.
user2: many sad scenes
user1: The Orca was a funny name for a boat.
user2: Schneider's List
user2: Indeed that is a funny name
user1: The scene in the cage was intense.
user2: I always think about that cage.
user2: In spite of my rage
user1: Yes
user2: Explosions in the sea, what a scene
user1: Quint went out with a bang
user2: He sure did
user1: Yeah, felt some tension for Hooper and Brody after that.
user2: Poor Quint
user2: Poor devils
user2: The 97% score is well deserved.
user1: Overall it was a great movie, I agree with the reviews as well.
user1: One of the best Spielberg movies.
user1: Also looked great for a movie from 1975.
user2: Yes
user2: for sure
user1: Overall I kind of rooted for the shark a little, which is funny. 
user2: It was ahead of its time.
user1: Good talking to you about the movie.
user2: Very good
user2: have we talked enough?
user1: I think so.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hey how's it going today
user2: Jaws! What a classic Speilberg thriller!
user1: you ever watched Jaws? That messed me up as a kid! lol
user1: I was afraid to take a bath for a month. Great movie!
user2: Were you a kid in 1975 when it originally came out to theaters? 
user1: No, it was VHS days. I wonder it they will be remaking it. 
user2: It was important for my chilhood as well. Robert Shaw as Quint was the most memorable character for me!
user1: Yes, his performance was excellent, I agree.
user2: Did you know the movie was based on a book by peter benchly? I never read it though
user1: It was based on a book by Peter Benchley, I wonder what gave him the idea.
user2: maybe he was an oceanographer like Hooper played by that one guy
user1: I haven't read it either. Maybe one day to see if its as good as the film
user1: You might be right, or maybe just a boring day fishing and he dreamed it all up
user2: If it's about a giant Great White shark attacking residents of Amity island it's probably alright.
user1: Yes, I agree!
user2: The film is well regarded. It has a scoref or over 97% on the rotten tomatos website
user1: Spielberg had so many great movies,  i see it's 87 on metcritics as well
user2: When Hooper finds the giant tooth at the sunken boat and drops it, what a tense scene!
user1: One of my favorite memories indeed
user2: Did you know that Amity island is actually a fictional place. Can't really go there and be eaten by a big shark, unfortunately!
user1: HAHAHA that's a shame!  Jaws was a early anamatronic so there goes that at well. 
user1: Quint offered his services for $10,000..........That was a fortune in 1975
user2: Well, the mayor did want to keep the beaches open, after all. 
user1: Yea, not much visitors coming to the beach if the ocean is a killing ground.
user2: They hunted the shark in a boat called the Orca, but I think they should have had a bigger boat.
user1: They should've called the coast guard or at least david hasslehoff
user2: The part where they sink harpons tied to bareels into the flesh of the shark used to bum me out, but not anymore. I'm glad it's dead.
user1: Jaws is too gruesome for kids the reviewer said... Yet parents couldn't wait to show it to us lol
user2: How strange. At least one critic characterized it as funny in a woody allen way
user2: seeya
user1: have a nice one

conversation:
user2: Have you watched the movie "Jaws"?
user1: Yes, a long time ago
user2: Great! Who is your favorite character of that movie?
user1: The shark, ha ha!
user2: Me too! What is your favorite part of the movie?
user1: When they are singing the song on the boat.  What about you?
user2: My favorite part is when the shark showed up and they tried to attack other character, one by one.
user1: Do you like movies about sharks?
user2: Yes, I loved thriller movies especially about sharks. I like the way they kill humans.
user1: I like when they brought the first victim's parts back in a box
user2: My favorite part also was when the main characters also hunt the shark and they tried to kill it.
user1: It is interesting to watch the citizens of the town who think it isn't a shark
user2: Do you agree that this movie is one of the greatest movie directed by Spielberg?
user1: No, I like "E.T." better
user2: Nice to know that you also like the other movie of Spielberg.
user1: Is he your favorite director?
user2: Yeah, Spielberg is may favorite director and this particular movie "Jaws" was my favorite.
user1: Did you believe it was the first shark they caught or did you think it was a bigger shark?
user2: I thought there was a bigger shark.
user1: Me too.  I also liked the music for this movie.
user2: The sound effect used in the movie was so effective.
user1: Did you feel sorry for any of the people who were killed?
user2: Yes of course! It was a really a gruesome and tragic death for them.
user1: Were you sad when the shark was killed?
user2: No, they deserved being killed.
user1: Yes, it ate a lot of people.
user2: Do you think that it gained a good rating as a movie?
user1: Yes, I agree with the rating it was given.
user2: It got a 97% in Rotten tomatoes

conversation:
user2: Hello?
user1: hi
user1: hang on, I got a lot of stuff to read, don't leave
user2: ohhh okay
user1: I'm here to talk about the movie Jaws
user2: Oh great. Kinda going back a ways. lol
user1: yes. it has a 97 percent score on RT
user2: Have you seen the movie? I have but it's been about 30 years
user1: I have. Critics said it was a scary thriller that worked because it was populated with characters who evolved into human beings
user1: Perhaps you have a question or ten I could answer. Easy questions, and then you can decide whether to watch it or no?
user2: The only thing I remember was the scene with the shark circling this boat and two men on the boat, then suddenly it like jumps on top.
user2: Who is the old man character, do you know? I know he's famous but I can't remember his name.
user1: You should also remeber the opening scene that takes place ata party on Amity Island, on the beach
user1: he was played by Robert Shaw
user2: I would have to see it again. It's been so many years. Were there any young people who got famous from the movie?
user1: I believe Richardy Dryfuss went on to become a beloved star of screen after this role, and probably before it.
user2: Oh yes I know him!  When did the movie come out? I know I was a child. 
user1: This movie came out in 1975,
user2: I would have been six!  Do you know who directed it? 
user1: It was directed by Stephen Speilberg
user2: Wow. He has done a lot. I wish I could think of more questions. lol There must have been some pretty girl. There's always a pretty girl. Know any actresses from the movie?
user1: Lorrain grey was sheriff brody's wife. perhaps you'd like to know genera or key scenes from the movie?
user2: Yes tell me about the first kill!
user1: A young woman is violently pulled under the water. 
user2: Were any children killed by the shark?
user1: After a tiger shaerk is caught, the mayor pronounces the beaches safe once again.
user2: But it was the wrong shark?
user1: Metacritic gives it 87 out of 100, no, I don't think it was the right shark.
user2: What was the rating? Was it rated R?
user1: Robert Shaw was Quint
user1: I don't have that on my sheet, so I'm not suposed to answer
user1: Jaws was based on a novel
user2: Ohhh okay. I think it was. Surely back then it would be. 
user1: Do you want to watch it?
user2: Okay
user1: Also, we're done
user2: Yes I would love to rewatch it! yesss!
user1: see ya

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: I love Jaws, was a real thriller. Right?
user2: I love Jaws too! The giant man-eating  white shark kept me away from going into the ocean for awhile.
user1: Me too! I haven't been back since. Must have been too gruesome for children.
user2: Yes definitely an action packed movie with lots of scares. I didn't even feel bad for the shark's victims. I mean I didn't want them to get eaten when I was scared, but part of me kind of wanted them to be eaten too!
user1: I thought my man Chief Martin Brody was sweet in it.
user1: I agree, a shark gots to eat too
user2: I think Robert Shaw was iconic in that movie as  the shark hunter.
user1: Although I wish there was more pie in it, I thought Spielberg did a good job Directing.
user2: He definitely made a great movie, like a Woody Allen movie but with more pizazz!
user1: Exactly! It got pretty good scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I bet it would have got a 99% if it had more pie.
user2: Metacritics socred it with an 87 which isn't bad at all. Maybe pie was the deciding factor.
user2: I thought it was totally believable that they would put a bounty on the shark after the second attack.
user1: I agree, after it ate that skinny dipper Chrisse Watkins. I bet to the shark, she tasted like pie.
user2: Must have been a low sugar no carb pie because he went after the second person soon after. Weird how they waited for the second attack to rule it was a shark doing it.
user1: Yeah, they probably thought the bite mark looked like a propeller wound. 
user2: I didn't like the Mayor very much. I know he was worried about the town's economy but he definitely was quick to throw the people's safety in the water.
user1: Yeah I didn't the Mayor much either. Would you have joined the armature shark hunt frenzy? if instead of $10,000, you got 10,000 pies as the prize for winning?
user2: I probably would've still went for the money, though I don't know if the Mayor would've let me charge them $10,000 seeing as I am no professional shark hunter like Quint. You?
user1: Yeah, I so would have. But I would have sold all the pies but one, and triple my profit.
user2: That's how you do it. I knew when they caught that tiger shark it wasn't the right shark. I was so mad at Mayor Larry for opening the beach back up without fully investigating it.
user1: Yes very irresponsible! How could you tell? are you a shark expert?  
user2: That tiger shark was way too small! Poor Chrissie couldn't have been taken out by one of those! When they found the shark tooth in the submerged hull, I knew it was something way bigger. I am not a professional shark expert, but I do like sharks.
user1: Well nice use of logic! I agree, they should have know by the size of the bite mark.
user2: I loved the name of Quint's boat, the Orca.
user1: Me too, those are my favorite scenes in the movie!
user1: How do you feel about the ending?
user2: I thought the ending was great! I was on the edge of my seat when the shark destroyed the cage before Hooper could inject it with the hypodermic spear.
user2: What did you think?
user1: It was so intense! I felt a large sense of panic when the boat was sinking.
user2: I thought it was so smart to put the pressurized scuba tank in the shark's mouth. I would've never thought of that in the moment.
user1: It was genius. Quint's rifle really came in handy!
user2: I definitely thought the boat was going to sink before Brody could shoot the scuba tank!
user1: Well, I'm going to get going, the pies are almost done. Remember, look out for fins when on the beach!
user2: Ok will do! I hope you enjoy those pies!

conversation:
user2: Do you like Steven Speilberg's older films?
user1: Yes! He's excellent at telling a story on screen. He's an awesome director. Did you find iJaws scary?
user2: I did when I saw it when I was younger. Even though you couldn't see the shark it made me terrified for the characters all the same.
user1: Yeah, it's amazing how they were able to make some of the parts without the shark just as scary as the parts with the shark! It shows how awesome a director Spielberg is! 
user2: Totally true. Casting Roy Schneider and Robert Shaw was a good move, too. They were perfect for their roles!
user1: Definitely! The scenery was perfect too! I don't think I'll be traveling to New England beaches anytime soon!
user2: Especially fictional ones! All kidding aside, I didn't know who wrote the book. I haven't otherwise heard of Peter Benchley but I think it's interesting he wrote the book in 1974 and the movie was released a year later. Steven Spielberg works fast.
user1: I didn't realize it was based on a book. I wonder if the book is as well liked as the movie. People seem to rate the movie pretty highly. 
user2: Yeah, both critics and audiences said it was very entertaining. Everyone seems to like the movie for what it is, a scare machine and a thriller. How do you think Steven Speilberg compares to other American filmmakers?
user1: I think he's very good at manipulating an audiences' feelings in a way that benefits his movies. For example, I wasn't too upset when the shark attacked the victims. 
user2: I agree, but I do like how the victims caused enough fear in the Police Chief to close the beaches and enough fear in the Mayor that the town would lose money from a lack of tourists to re-open them. I feel like Spielberg handled the plot very well.
user1: I agree. I thought it was interesting how quickly the coroner changed the cause of death for Chrissie. Although, I guess if he hadn't, there would have been much of a movie. 
user1: *wouldn't
user2: It sets the stage to make the frenzy over the bounty more believable, as does the opinion of the expert consulting oceanographer over the shark attack. That's how Speilberg moved the plot forward.
user1: I think it's an interesting addition to the plot that there's a bounty for the shark. 
user2: Yes the bounty raises the stakes and the excitement is shown by all the amateurs coming out to try to kill the shark.
user1: How did you feel when when the tiger shark was caught and the mayor proclaimed the beach safe?
user2: The Mayor only concealed the danger by doing that. People got hurt because he wouldn't take the threat seriously. The Police Chief's son went into shock after another shark attack.
user1: I thought it was terrifying when the shark's tooth was found in the submerged haul. 
user2: I think that's when they realized what they were dealing with. Did you like Robert Shaw as Quint?
user1: Yes, what did you think of Roy Schneider as Chief Brody? 
user2: He was convincing. I liked the part where he gets Vaughn to hire Quint.
user1: It's exciting when Quint, Brody, and Hooper go out to hunt the shark! 
user2: Yeah, especially when it appears out of nowhere behind the boat!
user1: I think it's clever that the boat was named "the orca". 
user2: I just picked up on that! It suggests the shark can take down anything.
user1: yeah, including a shark-proof cage! I guess it wasn't so shark proof after all.
user2: It absolutely devoured Quint. The best part of the movie, though, was when Brody stuffed a pressurized tank into the shark's mouth and shot it, blowing up the shark.
user1: I'm so glad the explosion kills the shark!

conversation:
user2: Wow, this was such a scary picture!
user1: Yes, I didn't know there could be sharks in New England.
user1: Do you like movies that are in the thriller genre?
user2: The setting made it all the more frightening due to the incongruity of the situation.
user2: Yes, I enjoy thrillers.
user2: Do you like thrillers too?
user1: I like the suspense and action in movies that are thrillers
user2: Can you recommend any good ones?
user1: I liked the movie. Did you? I can't say that I have seen any good thrillers lately.
user2: Yes, Jaws was great. I think I'll watch it again this weekend.
user1: I really enjoyed Roy Scheider in the movie.
user2: Yes, the acting is what made the movie for me I think, that and the screenplay.
user1: Did you agree with the mayors decision to reopen the beaches
user2: No, putting the public at risk for more tourism dollars sounds as dangerous as it is immoral.
user1: I agree. You could also argue that putting a bounty on the shark is also immoral. 
user1: It is just Hollywood though lol
user2: Yes, and a 40+ year old film. Good stuff to think about though.
user1: Especially the unlikeliness that there would be more than one shark
user1: Definitely a great screenplay though
user2: It did a great job guiding the audience through the story in a very blunt, jarring way, which is just what a thriller needs IMO.
user2: Keep the audience on their toes.
user1: It also made me feel like the characters like Michael were realistic and they could be someone I knew
user2: Yes, the characters were all too human, with little grandstanding or histrionics.
user1: Clearly we weren't the only ones who liked it. It has a 97% on rotten Tomatoes which must be pretty good
user2: Yes, it's a pretty highly-regarded movie; has been since 1975. I imagine it will be just as well-regarded in another 40 years.
user1: I do find the naming of the boat, Orca as quite ironic.
user1: Must be a pretty big boat
user2: A "killer whale" hunting a killer shark; too bad the boat didn't have teeth....

conversation:
user1: Do you like the actors?
user2: Yes, they are good. What do you think?
user1: Aren't we discussing "Jaws"? I see the description of "Jaws" on my screen. I think the actors are great
user1: I like Steven Spielberg's movies, do you?
user2: Yes, Jaws is the topic. One thing I notice is that the main characters are mostly men, the only woman plays the role of a wife. I like his earlier work more than the recent stuff
user1: Do you agree with critics?
user2: Jaws has high ratings on review sites, yes I agree with them it is a great film
user2: What do you think?
user1: They say this movie is really scary and even though i agree that this movie is great I don't think it's scary. I prefer different type of scary movies
user2: Maybe it is more creepy than scary. I don't really like scary movies, but I do like Jaws. But it made me not want to swim in the ocean for a while after I saw it
user2: Some critics said Jaws is too scary for children, what do you think of that?
user1: I agree. Too much blood. I would definitely not let my child watch it until he is old enough 
user2: I wonder how old would be old enough. Maybe it depends on the child. I don't remember what rating Jaws had -- or did they even have ratings in 1975?
user2: Hi, are you still there?

conversation:
user1: Jaws is a good movie.
user2: i love it. Do you like Spielberg's directing?
user1: No.  I think its a little much.
user2: It was scary, but liked the character development. You?
user1: Its a scare machine that works with computer-like precision.  You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy,
user2: it is like that! I liked Dreyfus' character though.
user1: Matt Hooper is an oceanographer.
user2: Yes. I liked the interplay between Him and Quint. Can you believe it came out way back in 1975?
user1: Yes.  It was based on Peter Benchley's 1974 novel of the same name.
user2: The story line actually seemed believable.
user1: A sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings.
user2: They attribute that to Spielberg's directing skill. Do you think they're right? I lean that way.
user1: The most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made.
user2: That's what the critics claim. I agree. What did you think of the casting of Robert Shaw as Quint? interesting choice.

conversation:
user1: hey whats up did you know Jaws was made during the 70s
user2: Yeah I did, its the movie that really put Spielberg on the map
user1: Yup where you alive when is was made and did you see it  in theaters ?
user2: No, I wasn't. I wish I did get to see it in theatres? What about you?
user1: no I was born in 1986
user2: oh, well I really love Roy Scheider in this movie
user1: ok cool 
user1: it's funny how the people really didn't thin kit would become a classic but now it is.
user2: Yeah, it was just sort of a big grosser back then, but not so much a critical darling, and know its one of the more beloved films from the era. 
user1: i saw that is is a thrill to me it seems more like a horror flim. What are your thoughts
user2: Yeah its more of a monster horror film, its violent at times too. 
user1: I didn't know it was based on a book
user2: I heard the book wasn't all that great
user2: it diverges into some subplots that aren't really that meaningful and such
user1: oh really i an more of a see the movie first and then read it type of person
user2: I really depends on what it is for me. 
user1: yeah with a lot of sub plots going on you tend to lose track of the main one and it just goes around and around
user2: The film just focuses on the shark and how the town and people react
user1: yeah seems boring but i remember watching it when i was little and it seemd so cool and fun!
user2: the opening scene is one of the most famous
user2: it really grips you with the music too
user1: yup it sure is and the musci really does it for me too i love it so much
user2: as soon as you hear it its just goosebumps on your skin
user1: yeahs becuase you know the shark is coming  he seems to come out of nowhere and the njsut boom your dead.
user2: Yeah and then the bloody arm sinks to the bottom of the ocean, its really great. 
user1: I like the final bit when they hunt the shark down and finish him off
user1: oh i forgot that part 
user2: Yeah the way they improvise to finally finish him off is great
user1: it seems nice 
user1: i saw when AVGN did a review on Jaws it was cool
user2: I assume he liked it?
user1: yeah he did is was a fun review
user1: i like the old horror moives like this as well i like the puppets and the real fee land look before CGI came along for everything
user2: Its amazing the cultural impact its had, I don't think we would have shark week without the movie
user2: Yeah they had to work hard to sell the shark
user2: They couldn't take any shortcuts. 
user1: lol oh yeah can't forget shark week that movie comes on like crazy during that time and so do some of the lesser know clones and knock offs

conversation:
user2: hai
user1: .iH
user2: how about ur work

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hello!
user1: I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was terrified of the ocean for a long time.
user2: That is hilarious I bet the movie is extremely scary! What is it called?
user1: It is called Jaws.
user1: It is a classic thriller.
user2: Jaws sounds intriguing! Can you tell me more about the movie? 
user1: It came out in 1975, and it is about a huge man eating shark.
user1: It was directed by Steven Spielberg and has won critical acclaim among critics of all kinds
user2: Wow! A huge shark! So does the shark go around killing people? Do people avoid the ocean out of fear that the shark will kill them? 
user2: Steven Spielberg makes classic movies I'm totally interested in learning more about his movie. 
user1: Yes, it starts attacking people in a fictional New England town called Amity Island.
user2: Oh wow! I have never seen a movie with a killer shark before! How giant is this shark? Are we talking Godzilla big?
user1: Not quite.  It is a Great White Shark, but it is on the larger end of the shark spectrum.
user1: After the first attack, the police chief wants to close the beaches, but the mayor doesn't let him because he thinks it will ruin the economy and tourism of the town.
user2: That is totally awesome! You stated that it won some awards? Or was it only nominated? 
user1: Not sure about awards, but it holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 87/100 on Metacritics.
user2: Wow how silly is the mayor! He doesn't care about innocent lives!
user1: Not at all!
user1: So then another attack happens and a bounty of $10,000 is put on the shark
user2: That is awesome! 97% is not bad and rotten tomatoes is a reliable source. 
user2: I can't believe a bounty is put out on the shark as if it is a common criminal lol I think this movie is going to be interesting to watch for sure!
user1: For sure.  Next what happens some fishermen catch a Tiger Shark, so the mayor lets people back on the beaches, thinking the attacks will stop.
user1: But of course they don't!
user1: The Great White comes back and kills a boater.
user2: Not a smart idea! Wow! I can only imagine the level of panic and fear! 
user1: Right!
user1: So this local shark hunter named Quint decides to go after the shark.
user2: This shark is evil! Wow I hope they are able to put an end to the shark once and for all!
user1: The way it ends is amazing.
user2: Was Quint successful in killing the shark?
user1: It attacks the boat that the shark hunters were on and ends up killing Quint!  Luckily there are two other guys named Brody and Hooper.
user2: OMG!!! Wow at least Quint was brave enough to at least try. 
user2: Brody and Hooper are able to kill the shark?
user1: Yes indeed!  The shark attacks the boat and it starts to sink.  Then Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's open mouth.  Brody grab's Quint's rifle and shoots the tank, which explodes and kills the shark!
user1: It is so tense at the end
user2: Wow! Imagine that shark guts everywhere lol I bet it was an intense ending! 
user1: Once the shark is dead, they are able to grab some boat pieces and paddle back to safety.
user1: It is a great movie, so you should definitely watch it!
user2: I'm sure there journey back on land was tiring for sure! I am totally stoked about this movie!
user1: Great!
user1: Well it was a pleasure chatting with you.
user1: Have a wonderful day.
user2: Same and thanks so much for your input!

user2: hey
user1: have you seen jaws?
user2: I have, many times
user1: its a movie from 1975 
user2: Yes, its a classic
user1: thats a long time ago. longer than i thought 
user1: it was a year after the novel of the same name
user1: written by peter benchley
user2: Yeah, he wrote a lot of good books
user2: but this is a great classic movie
user1: in hindsight you wouldnt think itd be such a classic
user1: its just a movie about a shark 
user2: they wanted to use the shark more in production, but it broke all of the time so thats why you barely see it in the movie
user2: it worked out better that way
user1: ah that makes sense
user1: i suppose it may have made it more ominous 
user2: Yeah, maybe so
user1: they thought the shark was a tiger shark at first
user1: but i think this movie helped make great white sharks seem even more dangerous
user2: Oh yeah
user1: like they were the kings of the shark world
user2: thats for sure, I know it scared me when I thought about water
user2: so that worked
user1: this movie was critically acclaimed too
user1: 97% on rotten tomatoes
user2: Oh yeah, it made spielbergs career
user2: he was nothing before that
user1: yeah
user1: metacritic rated it 87 out of 100

user1: this isnt a movie id expect would make people rave about so much
user1: in terms of the plot
user2: Yeah its a simple plot
user1: i think thats it
user2: with great actors
user2: this has been a good chat

conversation:
user1: Hello. Have you seen the 1975 movie, Jaws?
user2: Yes I have, Have you?
user1: Yes. I always think about that music. It's so haunting when you know Jaws is coming. lol
user2: Yes, it is impressive that most of the time you don't even see the shark. 
user2: It isn't intended to be watched by kids, but I bet alot of kids have seen it. 
user1: Yes, that's true. It's up there as a scary thriller I think. 
user1: Kids today have seen a lot more scary movies than I ever did. My 9 year old grandson has seen it.
user2: Absolutely Spielberg definitely knew how to make a movie with high ratings in 1975
user2: Yes, I watched it when I was very young the music freaked me out. 
user1: I agree totally! He's a very talented director who still creates great stuff today.
user1: Even Rotten Tomatoes gives it 97%
user2: The movie seems to work because the characters seem relatable.
user2: Yeah and an average of 9.2 out of 10. Impressive
user1: It takes a simple scene, families at the beach on a holiday weekend. What could be worse to experience??
user2: An unexpected shark attack ruins the perfect holiday. 
user2: They tried to say it was a boating accident in an attempt not to scare everyone
user1: Remember the scene when the shark hunters were aboard the boat and they were drinking and singing and having fun then all of a sudden, Boom, jaws rammed the boat!
user2: They caught a tiger shark and thought the problem was solved... little did they know
user1: Oh, I remember. Some of those scenes are memorable for sure. 
user2: Yes it seems everyone is in disbelief that Jaws actually was real. 
user1: Richard Dreyfuss is still acting, right? Always liked him. I think Roy Schneider passed on though.
user2: Richard Dreyfuss definitely did well as Matt Hooper in the movie. 
user2: I wonder if people try to find Amity Island where the movie fictionally takes place?
user1: Good question. I'll have to Google it. Wasn't it the mayor in Jaws that didn't want to "scare" people so he wouldn't cancel the holiday festivities! Big mistake
user2: In the movie they lay out a chum line, I wonder if that was necessary. Seems like Jaws like any boat
user1: Lol. Yes. Some of the scenes were a bit much. 
user2: In the movie they attempt to use a shark cage. That made for an interesting scene.
user2: Hooper was lucky to escape.
user1: Yes, and now I've seen programs with divers in those cages. They're crazy!
user2: They finally take him out with a oxygen tank explosion.
user1: Yikes! I wonder if the 1975 Jaws movie could every be re-made modern day. 
user2: I doubt it would get 8.0/10 from IMBD
user2: IMDB
user2: The boats name was Orca, and they were hunting a shark.
user1: Most likely yes. I like to make my own decisions about if a movie is worth watching or not.
user2: Yes, the rating tends to just be a suggestion i suppose
user1: There have been other shark movies that still don't top this one.
user2: Steven Spielberg definitely knew how to impress the critics in 1975,
user2: I liked how intense the scene where they are paddling back to shore is. 
user1: You feel like you are right there in the scene. In my case, I'm probably turning away so not to look.
user2: Whatever makes you want to turn away is like an adrenaline rush that makes me want to watch more of the movie.
user2: Overall I think Jaws is a great movie.

conversation:
user1: Helloo! How are you today?
user2: Hey, I'm doing pretty well and I hope you are too. We're going to be talking about the movie Jaws. It's a great movie according to the critics and Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Aha! Jaws! That's a classic, no?
user1: What do our friends at Rotten Tomatoes have to say about it?
user1: Are you still there?
user2: Haha yeah, definitely a classic. Apparently it came out in 1975. Rotten Tomatoes voted 97% with an average of 9.2/10. As far as anything specifically that they said, it dpesn't say. One critic however said that it was the most cheerfully pervesre scare movie ever made.
user1: Wow. That's good. I actually never saw it, I don't even know why, but it never happened. Do you think it's very scary?
user2: I haven't either, but I've seen parts. It's anything but scary. I'm only authorized to talk about what's on my document though and I don't think this is it lol According to the critics though, it was also funny and I can attest to that due to the cheesiness.
user1: Oh I see... I wonder if the movie has aged well or not. Is there anything in what you're reading about the performance of the actors? Are they any good?
user2: Nope. Doesn't say. However one review says that the director, Steven Speilberg "is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days. So he at least did really well if none of the actors.
user1: What about the story. Is it a good story?
user2: Unfortunately I can't copy and paste anything, but it's about a man-eating shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity island, so in my opinion, it's a pretty good plot. Who doesn't like to see people dying in a movie every now and then?
user1: Good point. I wonder if there are gory scenes or if the dying happens off screen?
user1: Do you know if it's adapted from a novel?
user2: Actually, there are gory scenes as one critic was saying that it'd be too much for children to see. There words were "Jaws is too gruesome for children and likely to turn the stomachs of the impressionable of any age". It doesn't say if it's adapted to a novel and I don't believe it was anyway. From what I can tell, it's only a movie and I'm unauthorized to say what else has been made because of the movie itself.
user1: Hmm... So I don't think I'm going to see it with my nephews as I was thinking of doing. They like slightly scary movies, but I suppose they're way too young for that.
user1: Also, I don't want to rush you or anything, but if we keep on with this slow pace my timer is going to die on me before we're done. We're supposed to have 15 exchanges in about 20 minutes. And it's been 20 minutes already...
user2: Their is gore, but it's really cheesy so it shouldn't be that bad for kids in my opinion as well as relating to the document that I'm given. And I know what you're saying, but we're supposed to be covering like 4 other articles. I'm not even allowed to be talking about this, but I for one don't have a timer so I assume that it's supposed to change by itself at some point.
user1: I mean the timer on the HIT. I don't have that much time left, unfortunately.
user1: I'll think about it for the kids. I'm not sure they'll understand the cheesiness though. It's more of an adult thing.
user2: Dang what the crap. I've only spent just 10 minutes. It says that we will have 3 turns of conversation for each document, but nothing has changed. Do you have a "TASKS" button? What does it say? Maybe you're in control of when we get a new document or something.
user2: The documents are changing. Ask me more questions and I'll be as quick as I can. Apparently we're still talking about the same movie. 
user1: Normally, the new document just appears after we've had three exchanges about it. It just shows in the same window. I don't have any control on anything. No tasks button.
user1: Yeah, I think it's always about the same movie. One movie per HIT I think.
user1: So, is Jaws fast paced?
user2: Alright, well somebody goes skinny dipping in the ocean and is violently pulled underwater.
user1: Sounds scary. Is there also a love story or something of that kind?
user2: Ughhh doesn't say. I'd imagine it being about 90 minutes but doesn't say. And I don't know lol I'm only allowed to talk about what's in the different scenes and discriptions and it doesn't tell me if there is or not. I'd imagine honestly, but I have no clue
user1: What do they say about the movie? Can you give me some details?
user2: They end up catching a large tiger shark and the mayor proclaims the beach to be safe, but evidently it's not. A bounty is then placed on the shark which results in an ameture  shark- hunting frenz.
user2: frenzy*
user1: I don't think it's even a tiger shark right? It's more like a big white shark.
user2: Some explosion kills the shark and the guy that barely made it paddles back to the island. And yes, I'm pretty sure it's great white. I think the people in the movie were confused with what they caught and they were wrong.
user1: The more we talk about it the more I think it sounds like a dumb movie.
user1: I guess it's all in the way the story is told, right?
user2: I'm not allowed to say lol But I will say that you wouldn't be wasting your time if you didn't watch it because I am allowed to say that at least. And I guess so. Regardless, the shark dies and everyone's happy.
user1: OK... Still on the fence. Is there anything else in your documents that could convince me it's a decent movie?
user1: Hey, I think our freedom has been given back to us. We can finish the conversation now :-)

conversation:
user1: Hi!  What movie will we be talking about today?
user2: Hi.  Want to watch Jaws?  It's from Steven Spielberg.  He's good!
user1: I have never watched Jaws before.  Is it scary, what else can you tell me?  I know Steven Spielberg is a great director!
user2: It's a scary thriller.  Some people think it is the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made.
user1: That sounds like an odd combination!
user2: I think you are thinking of a different kind of perverse...
user2: It got a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Wow!  A lot of people seem to have really enjoyed it!
user2: Someone did say it was funny in a Woody Allen sort of way, so you won't be shaking in your seat the whole time!
user1: I'm not really into silly funny movies.  It sounds kind of out there to me!
user1: What other movie would you compare it to?
user1: Are you still here?
user2: It's too gruesome for children.  I can't compare it to any other movie.  Just that this one is a sensationally effective action picture.  You'll have to think of your own comparison.
user1: It's good to know that my daughter would not enjoy it.  I don't really care for gruesome films myself.
user1: Who are some of the actors?
user2: Well, some of the most frightening sequences are those where we don't even see the shark.
user2: Rob Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, and Lorraine Gary.
user1: Those are some big name actors!
user1: What else can you tell me about it?
user1: Is this movie a remake?
user2: There's a scene where some local fishermen catch a shark, making the mayor claim the beach is safe.  However, that was a little premature and the great white shark ends up killing a boater and causing Michael to go into shock.
user2: No, but it is based on a novel by Peter Benchley.
user1: I haven't heard of Peter Benchley...has he written many books?
user1: Do you know how long the running time is on the movie?
user1: Who is Michael?
user2: I don't know how long it is.  Michael is a character - the son of the police chief.
user1: Have you seen this movie yourself?
user2: In another scene a character goes down in a shark-proof cage, but the shark demolishes it.  Luckily the character escapes.
user2: I have seen it.
user1: How do they escape?  What else can you tell me?
user2: Well, it kind of ruins the end for you maybe, but they end up blowing up the shark using a pressurized scuba tank that they shoot with a rifle.
user2: Then they are able to paddle back to shore on the wreckage of the boat the shark destroyed.
user1: Wow!  Sounds like the movie is action packed.  Not really my cup of tea, but I do appreciate the information!
user2: It is gruesome.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: Jaw was a magnificent thriller or me what do you think?
user2: I think that Jaws left me
user2: On the edge of my seat not knowing which attack would happen next.
user1: yes was a magnificent thriller
user2: Do you like scary movies?
user1: yes I like
user2: My favorite part of the movie was how casual the people were.
user2: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: This defiantly was not a kid friendly film. Would you agree
user2: Are you still there?
user1: My favorite parts from the movie was the sympathy for shark s vitims
user1: yes I am here
user2: Yes I can agree it was great to see how the victims reacted and their families.
user2: Sharks can be very vicious creatures.
user1: yes that s true
user2: It seems crazy that it is such an old movie
user2: But still I love it
user2: Like it’s a new movie.
user1: Yes mee to 
user2: I think we are done with the number of responses?
user1: I do not know, I think yes
user2: Do you have any more comments regarding the movie?
user1: I do not have any comments 
user1: you?
user2: I think I am done thank you
user1: thank you too
user1: bye
user2: Goodbye
user1: Why the finish conversation button don t work/
user2: So this next movie seems similar.
user1: yes is similar
user2: I’m not sure because I thought we would get another movie to pop up and read and discuss but it’s still Jaws
user1: yes, it is still Jaws
user2: Look at tasks maybe we said the wrong stuff
user1: I read the whole page, it seems okay

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Man eating shark!! out of the water quick
user2: Do you like thriller movies?
user2: Are you there?
user1: Hi! I love movies where beachgoers get whats coming to them!
user2: Cool!
user2: One of the reviewers said its
user2: too gruesome for children, i definitely want to see it
user1: Spielberg really pulled this one off.
user2: Agreed!   I don't think I've ever seen a Rotten Tomatoes critic rating of 97%
user1: It is pretty unheard of, even with a solid cast of Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw.
user2: I wonder how many people the shark ate
user1: It's funny--even though the critics review the shark as machine-like it doesn't diminish their fascination of the film.
user2: Another review says the movie doesn't once make you feel sorry for the victims.  They shouldn't be in the water during shark season I say.
user2: Do you like thriller movies?
user1: It was a summer resort town, where else would sharks go to eat people?
user2: Amity Island Snack and Go
user1: yes, love a good thriller! Can you imagine hunting a shark?
user2: Yes, with an AK47
user2: Other than that, I better be on a big boat, it doesn't say how big the police chief's boat was
user1: I don't think there is a big enough boat to hunt a man-eating shark that keeps killing people!
user2: Uh-oh, a woman is skinny dipping now omg
user1: I wouldn't want to see the remains they found on the shore, but I would probably look anyway...
user2: lol they closed the beaches, the police chief is the only one that gets to see
user2: oh wait a minute, the mayour overruled him, i guess you can go look
user2: can you believe they said she got killed in a boating accident?
user2: They let everyone back in the water
user1: Well, they had to, Fourth of July and all.
user2: It says they caught a tiger shark
user2: The drive thru is still open, no arms and legs in the tiger shark's belly
user1: They obviously caught the wrong shark, and Hooper and Brody proved it.
user1: They found that Great White tooth!
user2: Ewww a partial corpse rock and roll
user2: There goes the shark with the whole barrel
user2: Uh-oh, doesn't look like Quint will be cashing in on the $10,000 shark-finding fee anytime soon
user2: Sounds like an awesome finale, raining shark-bits
user1: Well, there goes The Orca, too!
user1: And now Hooper into the water.
user2: he must be crazy
user2: Will a scuba tank really blow up from a rifle shot you think?
user1: Well, it is a movie... and it is a great way to blow up a big shark, right?
user2: Depends how close you are lol
user2: Or if you have a raincoat and umbrella handy

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello! Today we will be chatting about Jaws. 
user1: Have you seen Jaws?
user2: yeah ive seen Jaws
user2: how about your
user2: you
user1: I LOVE Jaws. I think that Roy Scheider did an amazing job as Martin Brody.
user2: yes you are correct
user1: Richard Dreyfuss was amazing as well. 
user1: Do you remember the name of the New England town?
user2: nope! i forgot it
user2: i felt very thrill
user1: It is Amity Island. 
user2: after watching the movie
user1: Yes the moving is very thrilling! 
user2: somewhat fun too
user1: The part where Chrissie goes into the water skinny dipping, is one of scariest scenes I  have seen.
user2: yes! sound effects also very good
user2: good experience
user1: The part where Brody is diving on the sunken ship and sees the dead body was super creepy!
user1: That was when they realized that it was a giant Great White Shark and not the Tiger Shark that they had caught
user2: oh yeah very interesting 
user1: Do you remember the kids in the water on the 4th of July?
user1: The ones that did the prank?
user2: no i dont remember exactly
user2: but there is a scene in the movie
user2: is there any other things you found interest?
user1: When they are on the boat hunting Jaws, and the men are chumming the water, When Jaws appears behind the boat it scares me everytime 
user2: you are saying exactly what i felt
user1: And when Quint, the shark hunter dies. That was epic!
user2: and i like the heroine very much
user2: good spirit of acting
user1: Yes the whole cast was amazing! 
user1: The name of the fishing boat was the Orca. 

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: Hello.
user1: Have you seen any good movies lately?
user2: We'll be talking about Jaws, right?
user2: I've actually seen Jaws recently
user1: Oh really, did you enjoy the movie?  Can you tell me more about it?
user2: I really did enjoy the movie. It's a classic for a reason, I feel. It was very thrilling and the sense of dread throughout was pretty palpable.
user1: I usually don't like scary movies, would you consider it scary?
user2: Parts of it are what I would consider very scary. Lots of blood and frightening moments.
user1: What do you enjoy most about the movie?
user2: I like the fact that it is a very big enemy that they must find and kill in revenge for attacking people on the beach. It's a very big mystery as to what the shark will do and if it is actually planning this or if it's just nature taking revenge on humanity.
user2: It's a nail biter lol
user2: There's no way of knowing how it will actually end and if they will actually kill the shark or be killed
user1: So even though it is an older movie, it is still worth watching?
user1: I am thinking of watching it.  And you do make it sound interesting.  
user2: Absolutely, the effects might be a little dated and not as believable as modern cgi but it still has a lot of impact
user1: So you would recommend this movie to your friends? 
user1: Is there anything in the movie that you did not enjoy?
user2: Absolutely, it's a great movie to watch when you want something thrilling or scary. Good movie night kind of movie. It has a bit of a slow buildup and it seems like they spend a lot of time on exposition and introduction but once they get out into water, they're in the shark's territory and it gets interesting.
user1: That does sound like it might be worth watching.
user1: Maybe I will have to go check it out this weekend.
user2: It's great. It has a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: Wow, that's a really impressive score.
user2: Yup, definitely a classic in cinema.
user1: It seems like it would be really neat to watch this on the big screen.  I wonder if they show this at any theaters anymore these days.  
user1: Is there anything else you could tell me about the movie that I should know before watching it?
user2: I bet they do on cult movie nights. It's directed by Steven Spielberg if that tells you anything, a very good director.
user1: Oh yeah.  I have seen some other things he has done.  He is a pretty good director
user2: Definitely, not everything he does is great but he's pretty consistent haha
user1: Do you remember any of the other actors in Jaws?
user2: There's Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Lorraine Gary
user1: Oh, I have heard of Richard Dreyfuss.  I like him
user2: Definitely a good actor
user1: Well, thank you for the recommendation.
user2: No problem! It was nice chatting!

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello, How are you? 
user2: I am fine.How are you?
user1: Great! 
user2: Could you please tell me the movie name we are going to discuses? 
user1: So given the opportunity at hand I would like to tell you about a Thriller. A film Directed by one of the best....Mr. Steven Speilberg. That Film is Jaws
user2: That's great.I like the Director too.But I haven't watched Jaws
user1: Really? Well I think it is definitely something that you should add to you your list. 
user2: Oh, its about shark right ? could you tell me more about the movie ?
user1: The movie was adapted from a novel of the same name in which a Giant Man Eating Shark (A great White Shark to be  exact) attacks beach-goers on the shores of a resort town. 
user2: Is that based on true story ?
user1: No, but it feels real. 
user2: Oh 
user2: who played major role in that movie?
user1: The string of attacks prompts the Protagonist Roy Scheider (The Police Chief) to assemble a team willing to hunt down said shark. 
user1: It has been called "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it'spopulated with characters that have been developed into human beings"
user2: That's great. Is it worth watching now ? Because many animal related movies seems boring now a days.
user1: The film also features Robert Shaw (Quint), Richard Dreyfuss (Matt Hopper) and Lorraine Gary ass Ellen Brody
user2: great
user1: Absolutely, though it is a 70s film it has maintained a 97% Rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 8.0/10  on IMDB. 
user2: Anything above 8 rating on IMDB worth watching 
user2: could you elaborate movie plot ? 
user1: Sure thing. So amity is a small resort town that is suddenly plagued with shark attacks. After a few men find and capture a tiger shark the mayor deems the beach safe again. That does not sit to well with the Police chief so he reroutes all focus to finding the real shark. During such time he is often made to look crazy as he is the only one in town that believes the real shark is out there. I dont want to spoil too much for you 
user2: sounds great 
user1: it is definitely one of my favorites. 
user2: Is there any negative role in that movie ? 
user1: Only the Mayor, he is seen to disregard the safety warnings of the chief because he wants to continue making money for the town. 
user2: oh
user2: Is it ok to watch with kids ? 
user1: In my honest opinion i wouldn't but i clearly remember watching it at about 10 years old. 
user2: ok 
user2: steven spielberg movies are always worth watching surely I ll watch this 
user2: Nice to talk to you :) 
user1: There is some language but the gore aspect of it is so old school that it is hardly scary
user1: you too
user2: oh

conversation:
user1: Are you a fan of Steven Spielberg?
user2: This is my first movie I've seen by him.  It was really scary though!!!  Are you a Spielberg fan?
user1: I am! I love his movies. What do you think of Jaws?
user2: I liked that the characters were actually developed into human beings instead of just being one-dimensional.  I wish there were more female characters though.  The only lead female was the wife of a main character.  What did you think of Jaws?
user1: I think it's OK. I happen to agree with one reviewer who said that "characters are simply functions of the action". I don't really care about any of the characters.
user2: I agree with you.  I definitely think the movie was better at creating frightening sequences, than on character development.  I was surprised to see it had 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Would you give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down?
user1: Definitely still a thumbs up for me. It's a classic movie. Have you ever read the novel by Peter Benchley?
user2: I haven't!  I wonder if that's why the movie was so good at scaring people even without the shark visual, because you don't have the luxury of visualization while reading a book.  Overall, what did you think of Spielberg's directing?
user1: Well there's a reason why it's still remembered so much 40 years later. I agree with one of the reviewers who said that he knows how to tell a story. It really makes an impression.
user2: Definitely agree that it was a scary thriller.  Do you remember the name of the police chief?  I like whoever the actor was that played him.
user1: The chief was played by Martin Brody. I agree he was really good. For me though, the best performance was the shark hunter, whose name I forget.
user2: Robert Shaw, I think, played Quint the shark hunter guy.  What did you think of that opening scene?
user1: I first watched that scene like 20 years ago and I still remember it clearly. That's one of the best scenes opening scenes of all time. What about the violence in the movie? Do you think it served a purpose or was it just gruesome?
user2: I think it was just gruesome.  I have a kid, and I never would have brought my child to see that.  What did you think of the violence?
user1: I agree, it was too much. It seems to be a trend in movies during that time. Any other scenes that stand out to you in the movie?
user2: I actually really liked the scene with the medical examiner at the start of the film that lead them to close the beach.  I always find that medical stuff interesting.  How about you?  Did you like or dislike any of the other scenes?
user1: The scene on the beach, after the mayor refused to close them because it would damage the economy. I remember the tension in that scene, it was incredible. What was the name of the island again, where the movie is set?
user2: Amity Island!  Such an odd name.  Reminded me of "calamity" island.  Overall, what did you think of the protagonist?
user1: Don't even remember his name, but he was great. Remember when there was that calamity on the beach and he finally convinced that idiot mayor to hire the shark hunter? He was probably afraid because he was charging some crazy amount for his services.
user2: Haha, probably.  That mayor was an idiot.  The whole movie could have ended in ten minutes if he hadn't refused to close the beaches.  It was a little unrealistic and convenient that beaches were full of tourists though on that particular weekend of the shark attack.
user1: Why were all those tourists on the beach anyway? Was there some kind of holiday?
user2: Oh yeah! It was Forth of July, duh.  Did someone die in that scene?
user1: Yes, it killed a boater. Also the chief's son went into shock. Let's talk about the ending. What did you think?
user2: Mixed feelings! I really liked the tension when they were all in the boat hunting the shark.  Did you like any particular scenes at the ending?
user1: Well, can't talk about the ending without mentioning how he kills the shark. I wonder who came up with shooting a scuba tank in it's mouth. It was spectacular
user2: Haha, right?  But when the whole thing exploded I knew he was a goner.  What did you think about what happened to Quint?
user1: Perfect ending for that character. The actor's name escapes me, but he pulls off that grizzled sailor thing so well.
user1: Who survives at the end? Did they all die?
user2: Definitely.  Did you think the ending was appropriately suspenseful?
user1: I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Who survives til the end? Did they all die?

conversation:
user2: Hello! I really enjoyed this movie
user2: Is anyone there
user1: Hi! Yes I apologize!
user1: Me too! It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.
user1: I will watch anything that has a very high Rotten Tomatoes score.
user1: You know it's going to be good with a 97.

conversation:
user1: This is a classic iconic movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.
user2: which movie is that
user1: Jaws
user1: have you seen it?
user2: no I haven't what it is about?

conversation:
user2: Hello!  Did you know Jaws came out in 1975?  
user1: I didn't know!
user1: I'm interested with learning more
user2: It was based on a 1974 novel by Peter Benchley. 
user1: interesting
user1: What's the movie about?
user2: It is about a shark that attacks a beach.  
user1: Is it a regular shark or a super shark?
user2: It is a giant man-eating great white shark so I guess you could call that a super shark. 
user1: Does the shark kill a lot of people in this film?
user2: I do not know how many people are killed in the film, but it is described as too gruesome for children so I am sure there were many people killed. 
user1: Interesting, I think I'll watch this film 
user2: It has a rating of 97% on the Rotten Tomatoes website.  
user1: That makes it a very good film then
user2: Yes, and it was directed by Steven Spielberg.  
user1: Is it based from a book?

user2: that does sound interesting, Who plays the main characters?
user2: Also, do you know how long the movie is?

user2: Thank you for the information, I think I will check it out!

user1: 1975. It's based on a 1974 novel.
user2: Is there any other important information about the movie that I should know about?
user1: The opening scene is pretty cool. A woman gets attacked at a beach party, and the chief of police says its a shark attack, but the mayor tells everyone it was a boating accident so that tourists don't leave. Then a professional shark hunter shows up. Very exciting.
user2: Sounds like my type of movie. Again, thank you for the information.
user1: No problem. I think it has a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, so most everyone likes it.
user2: Is there anything else we have to cover, or how do we finish this conversation?
user1: Well, I'd love to tell you about the next scene, since I keep learning new information about the movie. There's another big death at the beach's fourth of july celebration.
user2: Okay, what are some of the other big scenes in the movie?
user2: Does the shark hunter eventually capture or kill the shark?
user1: Well, apparently they catch a tiger shark and the mayor says the beaches are safe. Some people think it's the wrong shark, especially when they find a sunken ship with a big shark tooth. But the fourth of July plans go on anyway, and someone dies.
user1: Not sure yet. But I know they hire him after the mayor's son goes into shock.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: What is the name of the movie
user1: The classic Jaws...
user1: I highly recommend seeing this movie if you have not. It's one of my favorite old time movies
user2: Is it a movie to buy or wait to watch on television
user1: It's a movie to def buy or even rent on tv depending on your service provider. 
user1: It's a thriller directed by Steven Spielberg and about a giant man eating great white sharks
user2: ok sounds good I did enjoy the movie thought it was a classic
user1: def a classic and it's even crazier it was filmed in fictional England 
user2: I thought the story was good and Speilberg did a great job.
user1: it really was a great story line with great characters
user1: i'll never forget the original beach scene 
user1: when the shark attack happened
user1: i had no idea what was happening
user2: Yeah it has been a while since I saw it. I don't remember the actors
user2: I do remember the shark attacks
user1: i remember the two brothers especially the one with blonde waxy hair
user1: yeah it was a shark attack in almost every scene though
user2: I remember the last scene well it was very good
user2: The way the tank exploded in the sharks mouth was awsome
user1: there was almost the 4th of july weekend where all the tourists were on the beach and the shark killed the boater
user2: Yeah I remember that it was pretty scary
user1: super scary
user1: they dont make movies like that anymore
user2: I like the music too 
user2: You knew the shark was coming when the music came on
user1: same it was spooky
user1: exactly!
user1: it may have been a tad too gruesome for kids at a young age
user2: Yes it was a very original movie
user1: and everyone became so scared of sharks due to that movie
user2: Are you scared to go swimming was the theme if i remember right
user1: i was! yes, i def still have a problem with sharks in the ocean
user1: i always think about this movie

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi
user1: Have you seen the movie Jaws?
user2: Which one wasn't there two?
user1: The first one, and I believe there was four. 
user1: Great movie, still one of my favorites to this day.
user2: It was very frightening when it came out
user2: Didn't the sound track win awards
user1: Yes, because this can and does actually happen. I don't know if the soundtrack won any awards But none the less a 1975 Thriller by Steven Spielberg and it should've. 
user2: I don't remember what beach that took place but people were afraid to go to the ocean for awhile. 
user1: So I'm taking it as you have not seen it, But you should. 
user2: In North Carolina there was a shark attack two years ago. 
user1: It took place on a fictional place called Amity Island
user1: They happen every year somewhere. 
user2: Who starred in the movie?
user2: anyone popular? 
user1: It has a great cast. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss which is my favorite. 
user2: I think I have seen it more than once but not recently. 
user1: I have it. So from time to time I'll watch it. It's a classic.
user2: I like Richard Dreyfus too, 
user2: I wonder if they play it on shark week
user1: I doubt it
user2: There have not been any new releases of sea monsters 
user1: The fact that sharks are attracted to splashing and the Mayor would not close the beach just shows most people don't think it could ever happen but again it does. 
user2: Did they call in some special shark hunter to catch it?
user1: And the boat they went out in was too small. 
user1: No, Quint offered to catch and kill it for $10k
user2: It had to have made a lot of money at the box office
user1: I believe it topped the box office yes
user2: That was 1975 huh?
user1: Yes, 
user1: You should definitely give it a try again.  
user2: What kind of shark was it again a great white?
user1: yes a great white 
user1: Supposedly rare for those waters 
user2: It was odd that they did not use a bigger boat to catch it, did that guy quint die
user1: It was based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley. I've never read the book, 
user1: Oh yeah, bitten in half
user2: There were four sequels, I only thought there was one other one
user1: Chief Brody and Matt Hooper survived. 
user1: There was 2, 3D and The Revenge
user1: I believe that's it. 
user1: I love horror movies 
user2: Funny they did not close the beach down 
user2: I do not usually watch horror movies that was different I guess, everybody was talking about it.
user1: The Mayor didn't want to lose money. Amity is a summer town 
user1: I'm pretty sure it's the #1 scary movie of all time because it can actually happen. 
user2: That is true that it can happen, it is not like a scary clown or walking dead
user1: Exactly 
user2: There really are monster sharks like that
user2: They do not typically attack boats
user1: Well I personally wouldn't call them monsters but yes 
user1: No but they have 
user1: Noise and comotion 
user2: They probably think it is food
user1: pretty sure I spelled that wrong lol
user1: That would be my guess
user2: The movie was good, it would be something you could watch with your kids today
user1: Jaws is too gruesome for children and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. 
user2: I did not go to the movie theater to see it
user1: Me either. Not sure when I seen it first
user2: I was in high school , everyone was going to the ocean during the summer holiday
user1: Well I'll tell ya, I've only been in the ocean once and all I thought about was sharks thanks to Jaws.  
user1: It put a fear in me that will never go away. 
user2: Me too, especially if you cannot see in the water.
user1: Right
user2: It must have been over 10 feet
user1: If I remember correctly it was 45ft 
user2: Amity Island it was in the USA right
user1: This makes my want to go watch it. 
user1: New England
user2: I lived in New England at the time, we did not seem to have any sharks then
user1: Well that's good. lol
user1: I'm from the Midwest 
user1: No sharks here. 
user2: When i think of the movie it reminds me of the Jersey Shore or Long Island
user2: that is good
user1: Never been there. 
user2: It is over crowded. I never liked swimming in the ocean anyhow.
user1: I think what's funny is you have no sympathy for the victims because they've all been warned and still go in. It's like see told ya. They got what they deserve. lol
user2: Things like that never happened back then. 
user1: Right, Now they must be over populated because you hear about shark attacks alot. 
user1: Like that surfer in Hawaii that lost her arm to a shark
user1: Scary stuff
user2: The waters are warmer and I think scientifically they think the sharks are coming closer to shore because of something they are eating.
user1: I was 6 in 1975
user2: I was 15. 
user1: Yep they eat , swim and make little sharks. 
user2: Every once in awhile they have Jaws on some TV channel
user1: Now you'll think of this conversation every time you see it's on. 
user1: I know I will
user1: I think it would be nice to live on an island like Amity. Very quaint 
user2: my hit exspired but 
user1: But?
user1: I'll finish the conversation then. Nice chatting with you. 
user2: I do not want you to lose your mone

conversation:
user2: Hey!
user1: Hello!
user1: Have you seen Jaws?
user2: No i haven't seen it
user2: what is it about?
user1: It's a movie about a giant shark attacking beachgoers off of Amity Island.  It's really scary!
user1: It's has 97 percent on rotten tomatoes
user2: Oh wow! Sounds interesting
user2: Thats a pretty good rating too!
user2: *sounds
user2: Would you say it is a thriller?
user2: or just scary to where it make you jump?
user1: Steven Speilberg directed it.  It's definitely a thriller.  A scary thriller, which also has some laughs. It'll definitely make you jump.  You'll feel like a rat being given shock therapy.  
user2: Oh WOW that sounds scray! and Steven Speilberg has directed some great movies in the past so I'm sure it'' be great. 
user2: How was the story line?
user2: was it easy to follow?
user1: Yes, it's a very effectively made movie.  
user2: That's great to hear!
user1: It starts out full of suspense right from the start and then builds from there
user2: Do you know how well it did in the box office?
user2: *office
user1: I don't know how it did at the box office, I just know the reviews were good.  
user2: Okay. Do you think they casted well for the movie?
user1: The real star of the movie is the shark, but there are some great actors in it like Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss
user2: Oh ok i'm not too familiar with them but it still seems like a movie worth seeing
user1: They say it's the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made
user1: It take place around the 4th of July so it's a fun summer movie
user2: Does the movie have a great ending?
user2: Oh that sounds great
user2: I can use something great to watch every now and then during the summer
user1: The ending is full of excitement, and wraps the movie up in a great way.
user2: Ok, so there aren't any loose ends then? Everything connects?
user1: They do a good job wrapping it up
user2: ok cool!
user2: I like movies without loose ends
user1: Me too!  Movies with loose ends are bummers.  It makes you feel like you wasted time watching it when you get a loose end.
user2: Yes I definitely agree. I like it to make sense throughout
user1: Me too.  I Like for a movie to make sense all the way through! 
user1: Otherwise you don't walk away satisified. 
user1: Maybe annoyed, but not satisfied. 
user2: Yup!!you will always have the feeling of not knowing which can be frustrating. A good movie connects everything and reveals to the audience the reasonings behind everything
user2: Thanks so much for the recommendation
user2: im excited to watch!
user1: You're welcome!  I hope you enjoy it!  
user1: It's a fun movie

user1: I was surprised to see the year it was released too
user1: I have seen "Jaws"
user2: Its kinda scary to watch to me , makes me scared go into ocean lol
user2: I never knew steven Spielberg was the director
user1: The special effects were good for it's time but wouldn't hold up now
user2: yes
user1: I didn't know he was the director either
user2: this movie is deffintly a nail bitter to me
user1: The movie is too scary for me but especially for a young child I wouldn't reccommend
user2: oh no children surley don't need to watch
user1: Spielberg was attempting to make a different kind of movie
user2: wow cant believe shark hunter gets 10000 to hunt sharks I still couldn't do that
user1: Than what a typical movie of thatt ime was
user2: oh ok
user1: Definitely not brave enough to hunt sharks
user1: Not even brave enough to watch a second time
user2: I know me either
user1: I had no idea the movie was based on a book
user2: me either 
user2: i don't see how fisherman was brave enough fish for a shark
user1: All of the critics appear to have thought highly of the movie based on the ratings from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes
user2: yea i seen that great ratings
user1: It makes sense and speaks to why the movie is still relevant all this time later
user2: yes that does make sense, you see where hooper goes in a shark tank very brave
user1: StephenSpielberg was a visionary with how he directed "Jaws"
user2: yes he was. he is very good director
user1: He was really able to develop the characters and the story line in a very cohesive manner.
user2: yea i believe that too
user1: The movie was enjoyable but a little too scary for my taste
user1: are you there?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hi!
user1: whats uo
user1: up
user2: not much
user1: what are you doing tonight
user2: just doing HITs and watching a little tv
user1: cool, anything good on TV?
user2: not so really, just watching this new 9-1-1 who, but let's talk about this movie that was directed by Steven Spielberg.
user1: what is it called?
user2: It's one of the most recognizable thrillers ever created by him.
user2: So there is a beach party where a woman name Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean.
user1: oh ok, why should I watch it
user2: do you like shark movies?
user1: yes sometimes
user2: well this movie is about a shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity Island. You definitely know it!
user2: the greatest shark movie ever created
user1: Yes, I know it is Jaws
user2: have you watched it?
user1: yes
user2: what did you like most about it?
user2: any particular key scenes?
user1: I have never watched it
user2: ah thought you said you had
user2: ok 
user1: No
user2: what do you think about Steven Spielberg in general?
user1: one of the greats
user2: one thing I can tell you is that it is worth watchin. Rotten Tomatoes has ait at 97% with an average of 9.2/10.
user1: wow that is impressive
user2: if you haven't ever watched it, I would suggest to see it at some point because it is one of the greats.
user2: I find it impressive because RT usually has the worst ratings for movies.
user2: do you thrillers?
user1: I think I will watch it 
user1: sometimes
user2: definitely give it a shot. you will like it if you like Steven Spielberg and his movies.
user2: even more you may find some humor in it

conversation:
user2: I think jaws is a great movie - a classic! Have you seen it?
user1: One of Spielberg's best movie
user1: It is a sensationally effective picture
user2: Rotten tomatoes gave it a score of 97%. What rating would you give it?
user1: I couldn't do any better than the 97% rating
user1: What did you make of Roy Scheinder?
user2: I don't know him from anything else, but I loved his character.  He's a crazy mofo, but I would def be friends with him in real life. 
user2: Wasn't the movie based loosely on real events?
user1: I know it's base on a novel of the same name by Peter Benchley
user1: And it is set in a fictional New England summer resort town, so don't it is base on real events
user2: Yep! I fund it hilarious that one critic described jaws as too gruesome for children and stomach turning for the impressionable any age.  
user1: hahaha
user1: and the part about you feeling like a rat, being given shock therapy
user1: Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is clearly absent from most American filmmakers these days.
user1: His onscreen story telling is unlike none
user2: I guess the graphics and gore were state of the art in 1975. But, yes, he is great at story-telling and developing characters.
user2: I wonder if the book received any acclaim prior to the movie. 
user1: With the movie having an average rating of 9.2/10, then the book should have received some high praises 
user2: I find it so interesting how in the movie when the town tried to cover up the shark attack and then the citizens went on a shark hunting frenzy - all those actions are spot on to how people have reacted in real life. Yet, the shark's behavior was pretty wrong.
user1: For $10,000 I too would offer my service just as Quint did
user2: What did you think of hoopers's character?
user1: I could tell he was a good oceanographer and he cared he scared for the safety of the town
user1: You could tell Vaughn interest was just on the revenue the beach could generate during the holidays
user1: How did you feel about Brody's son going into shock?
user2: Once brody's son goes into shock. it started hitting closer to home for brody, Vaughan, and the town officials. They only began to care and realize the severity when it affected them personally.
user2: Hooper cared more about the townspeople, and he had the least connection to them.
user1: that was the sad part about it
user2: What do you think of the quint and hooper team on the orca?
user1: I feel bad for Quint
user1: He was doing it solely for the money 
user1: but unfortunately for me, had to be devoured by the shark
user2: So who gets the 10,000 now?
user1: Hooper was courageous though, entering the water with a scuba gear, even with the shark-proof cage
user1: Lol. I guess nobody gets it now
user2: Have you seen any of the sequels to jaws?
user1: It was smart thinking of Brody stuffing that pressurized scuba tank in the shark's mouth
user1: Jaws has sequels?
user1: I didn't know that
user2: Yes, at least Brody redeemed himself with his bravery.
user1: It comes with the job
user2: Yes a few sequels, but Spielberg didn't direct, and they were incredibly b-rated. Probably straight to tape/dvd.
user1: Good thing then I did not see any

conversation:
user1: hellos
user2: hello
user1: Have you ever seen this movie before? it is a classic
user2: would you name the movie..?
user1: Its Jaws, directed by Steven Spielberg
user1: Steven is a incredible director
user2: how is it with respect to its story..?
user2: how interesting did you find its story line..?
user1: Its a pretty good story line. The story is about a giant man-eating great white shark who attacks any beach goer. With so many attacks happening the police chief decides its his responsibility to hunt down this giant beast.
user2: sounds goodi...
user2: good*
user1: the movie originally came out in 1975 as well.
user2: is it an animated movie..?
user1: for the most part the movie is real life but there are animated effects that really make all the difference in the action scenes of the movie.
user2: so is this a sequel or remake to one released before..?
user2: who are the actors playing different roles...?
user1: its the first movie for this story line
user1: the cast is roy scheider who is the chief in the movie, then there is rober shaw who plays a main character, then there is richard dreyfuss who plays as a main character, and Lorraine Gary who plays a main character as well
user2: the cast looks good
user2: is the movie thriller..?
user1: are you familiar with any of these actors?
user1: yes the movie is a thriller and received a 97% rating on rotten tomatoes
user2: i know roy scheider and heard of rober shaw
user2: can kids watch it..?
user1: I think that kids should be able to watch it, although it is a pretty action packed movie. Maybe if your kids are sensitive to scary situations it would not be a good movie to show, but I think I would be able to watch it as a kid.
user2: does it involve violence..?
user1: There is definitely some violence as the movie is about a man eating great white shark. There is also violence while hunting this beast of a sea creature down.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi!
user1: So, have you ever seen Jaws?
user2: No, I havent! Is it any good?
user1: If you are into horror movies, I guess you would enjoy it.
user2: I do like horror movies. What makes it a scary movie?
user1: It makes you want to stay away from the ocean.  It's about a shark that kills people.
user2: Oh wow, that does sound scary. I do not like a lot of gore. Is it a very bloody movie?
user1: Not really.  It's made in the 70s so it doesn't get as bloody as movies do now.
user2: Oh i see! That sounds very interesting. Do you know where it takes place?
user1: It's on a fictional island called Amity Island.  It's supposed to be located in the New England area.
user2: That is very cool! Is it well made? or is it a B-Movie?
user1: It did really well at the box office and is considered a classic horror movie.  I wouldn't consider it a B-Movie.  Plus, it was directed by Spielberg!
user2: Oh wow, it must certainly be worth seeing then! What was it about Jaws that you liked the most?
user1: I haven't seen from start to ending it myself, I just hear good things about it.  I always channel surf and watch bits and pieces. 
user2: I see. I often hear good things about it too but I never knew really what it was about or why it was so great.
user1: I usually check Rotten Tomatoes for scores of movies.  This one has a 97% rate so it must be pretty good!
user2: With such a high rating and an acclaimed director, im sure its great. I am just confused - if its about a shark who kills in the water, why not just stay out of the water?
user1: I think it was more a government thing.  The Mayor tried to convince the public that the waters were safe.  
user2: Oh, I see! Thats fascinating! A little mystery and greed type story-line playing along side of the horrors of the ocean. That make it much more interesting to me. 
user1: Yeah, I agree.  I wonder if it's on Netflix.
user2: Im sure it is - they seem to have everything these days. I wonder what it would have been like to see it on a big screen!
user1: It was great talking to you!  I think this is the end of the 12 turns!
user2: Oh, you too. Thank you for the info! :)
user1: You're welcome!
user2: I will certainly look into Jaws! Sounds great.
user1: Definitely!
user2: :)

conversation:
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user1: Jaws.
user2: what is the movie about?
user1: And it is a 1975 thriller directed by Steven Spielberg about a giant man eating great white shark
user2: is it a scary movie?
user1: It is a scary thriller based in a New England SUmmer townd.
user1: *town
user2: what else can you tell me about the movie? would you recommend it?
user1: I think I would.  It was directed by Spielberg, and has Richard Dreyfuss in it, so if you like them, then you'd likely like the movie.
user2: does it have any other well known people in it?
user1: With it being an older movie, I'm not sure you'd recognize the names, but it has Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Lorraine Gray.
user2: would it be okay for teenagers or kids to watch?
user1: It starts with a beach party taking place on the island where a woman decides to go skinny dipping and gets violently pulled under.  If you're into them type of movies (and even if you're not) you'd likely enjoy it.  Spielberg is famous for a reason.
user1: I would not advise children watching it, but older teenagers should be fine.
user2: what is the movie rated?
user1: I'm not sure what the rating is, but I would think it to be PG-13
user1: The mayor tries to somewhat cover up this monster shark, because of fear it'll lose tourists.
user2: what else can you tell me about the movie?
user1: They initially catch a large tiger shark, and think that the beach is safe again.  They find a very large great white tooth afterwards, convincing the oceonagrapher that the shark is still there.
user2: is this movie a musical? is it known for its songs or soundtrack?
user1: By what I'm reading, I would think it's quite far off from a musical, and I don't think there is any noteworthy music in it.
user1: It's a kind of dark thriller.
user2: where did you say the setting of this movie is?
user1: It is of a New England Island called Amity Island (unsure if that's a real island or made up for the movie however).
user2: what else do you know about this movie?
user1: the 3 main characters set out together to hunt the shark.
user2: is it funny even though it is a thriller?
user2: do they end up catching the shark?
user1: I would say there is little to no humor involved.  They attempt to catch it, and it ends up sinking the ship the 3 guys are on.
user2: is this one of steven speiburgs best films?
user1: They stuff a pressurized scuba tank into it's mouth and blow it up.
user1: It's certainly rated as though it would be one of his best.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi
user2: I believe this movie has a lot of suspense 
user1: As do I
user2: simply because it is under the thriller category
user1: And it seems the characters are well represented
user2: now i would want to watch this movie lol
user1: LOL I like the aspect of the unknown and when it comes to underwater stuff
user2: however i didnt know there was a novel written first
user1: Steven Spielberg directed it, so you know it would be good.
user1: I didn't either, that's surprising.
user2: $10,000 seems like a lot of money
user1: Yeah especially in 1975
user2: Says jaws is too gruesome for children or for people with a weak stomach. Lol, it wouldnt be a problem for me
user1: That is like a years salary for some back then lol
user1: Yeah I would imagine if a child sa this they may get scarred for life about the ocean
user1: My question is why would anyone go skinny dipping in the ocean at night?
user2: seems like the ratings are really good based on the charts
user2: for a fun time ;) lol
user2: but wasn't so fun afterall. maybe just for the shark
user1: Yeah, it has really good ratings in general.
user1: lol 
user1: And being pullewd underwater would scare anyone :L(
user1: Then to make matters worse you have to go hunt the hug thing down !
user1: Huge
user2: i wonder how a party would be in 1975 
user2: compared to today's parties
user2: and i bet! luckily it's not based off a true story. LOL
user1: I'm sure it would be the same in some ways. Beer snd probrably weed and a touch of disco lol
user1: Roy Scheider was a good actor back then.
user2: so it seems like they exploded the shark lol
user2: and too bad i dont know the guy 
user1: That would a site to see in real life lol
user2: shark jerky for everyone :)
user1: LOL you won't go hungry for a while to be sure.
user2: It doesnt say where this movie takes place though
user1: I wonder how many people the shark killed.
user2: just on amity island 
user2: but i wonder wheres that at
user1: Yeah some summer tourist town.
user2: well i'll be sure to not go skinny dipping there lol
user1: hahahaha you and me both 
user1: Would be nice to catch some sun though lol

conversation:
user1: Hi there!
user2: Hello!
user2: You know what a great movie to watch is? The original Jaws, it's a thriller from 1975, directed by Spielberg!
user1: I've heard great things about that film! Is it scary...you know, with gore?
user2: Well gore is to be expected when you're watching a movie about a giant man eating shark attacking swimmers!
user1: You're probably right! Did it win any awards in the 70's?
user2: It might've. But you know what's pretty impressive? The scores it received. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 97%, and that's not common at all! You know if Rotten Tomatoes gives it a top notch rating, it's worth a watch
user1: A 97% is unheard of! I usually trust Rotten Tomatoes ratings, too. Who stars in the film? Anyone I would recognize?
user2: Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, Robert Shaw plays Quint, Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper, and Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. Pretty good actors for their time!
user1: Great actors! Is it a long film?
user2: Maybe you can check online but I'm not really sure. You know what's interesting though? The movie is based on a novel from 1974 by Peter Benchley! Sounds like a great movie based on an intriguing read!
user1: Good to know. Might be a good read. Does it have any sequels if I really like it?
user2: I'm not sure but it should be easy to find out online! Do you want to hear more about the movie? Perhaps a key scene?
user1: absolutely!
user2: Well, a major introductory scene takes place at dusk on Amity Island. A woman by the name of Chrissie Watkins decides to go skinny dipping, where she is pulled underwater. The next day her partial remains are found on shore, and the examiner ruled her death was caused by a shark attack. There is also some political/economic context where Police chief Brody tries to close down the beaches for safety, but Mayor Vaughn overrules him fearing it will ruin the towns economy. Do you want to know more?

user2: Are you there ?
user2: Yea 
user2: Its a thriller movie
user1: a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional New England summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it

user1: sensationally effect action picture a scary thrill
user1: work the best
user2: yea
user2: yes the director is known for his dedication and hard work 
user1: Jaws" is the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the US
user1: "Jaws." It's not simply a splendid line of dialogue, it's an example of Steven Spielberg's strategy all through the film, where the shark is more talked about 
user2: oh
user2: yes
user1: i alos like the cast
user1: have you
user2: yes me too
user2: Roy Scheider 
user1: yes
user1: how was experiece with me
user2: Had it won any awards ? 
user1: i like most

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hello
user1: Looks like we are going to chat about a movie based in New England.
user2: Yeah.
user1: 1975, that sure was a long time ago.
user2: Yes it were. and the one of the best movies to come out was Jaws.
user1: Do you generally watch movies such as this genre?
user1: Reading the critical response section, it sounds like a very scary movie.
user2: Honestly, I typically don't watch these type of films but this one is my favorite.
user1: No kidding!  What makes it your favorite?
user2: yep. A great white shark that most people feared
user1: I've never really given much attention to rotten tomatoes opinions.  Do you?
user2: It's not a human doing all the killing, but a shark. it makes a interesting story.
user2: I used to use rotten tomatoes to find out how good a movie is but not much anymore
user1: Gotcha.  I'm not sure I would find a movie about a killer shark so believable.
user2: Do you watch movies like this one?
user1: Generally I do not.  I'm not much of an animal person.
user1: I see that Steven Spielberg is involved in it.  I think he has done some other famous movies, hasn't he?
user2: Yeah. Like Poltergeist, Jurrassic Park, etc.
user1: Oh wow.  I've heard of Jurrassic Park.  I wonder if he makes a cameo in Jaws?  That would be cool.  Like Stan Lee.
user2: I dont remember him making cameo in the movie.
user2: Me neither
user1: I see this movie took place on a 4th of July weekend.  Lots of big moves are centered around the 4th of July.  I see why in the movie they didn't want to close the beaches with all the tourists there.
user2: Of course. they wouldn't it. is a money maker to them. the mayor is greedy.
user1: I'm not one for going to beaches, maybe this is why. Ha.  Do you go to beaches?
user2: lol I actually like going to one. It's one of my favorite places to go during the summer. 
user1: I noticed that the novel was in 74 and the movie in 75.  That's a pretty quick flip from novel to film.  I bet a lot of fans of the book were in the theaters.  Did you read the book?
user2: No. Never read the book. come to think of it, I never read books most films based off of.
user2: I wondered of the book stayed true to the film.
user2: i mean the film stay true to the movie
user1: That's an interesting thought.  I bet it did.
user1: Well it's been nice chatting about Jaws with you; enjoy your day.
user2: you too!

conversation:
user1: Jaws seems like a really good movie.
user1: Also hello there.
user2: Hello 
user1: Do you like movies of the thriller genre?
user2: I don't know if it's a movie I would want to see by just reading the paragraph.  Just not my kind of movie.
user2: I don't like thriller or scary.  I don't like suspense either.
user1: Ah I see. It seems pretty highly rated though.
user2: It may be better than it seems from just a written paragraph.
user1: Have you ever watched any of Spielberg's movies?
user1: Yeah it might be hard to convey the movie with just a paragraph.
user2: Do you enjoy movies in this genre.
user1: No I don't generally like thrillers.
user1: Unless the premise is interesting or something.
user2: I don't think I would be interested in this movie.  The new paragraph lets me know for sure it's not for me.
user1: Oh it does sound scary.
user2: I do like sharks.  
user1: Oh you do? Do you like great white sharks like the one in this movie?
user2: I think they are awesome.  I also think we should respect their world.  
user1: Yeah they are pretty cool. It's sad when people seem to react like the way people reacted in the movie to sharks.
user1: Like this shark hunting frenzy
user2: Exactly.  I think I like animals more than people at times.  We make some really stupid choices.
user1: Haha yeah. People can be capable of some terrible things.
user1: Charging $10,000 to hunt a shark really shows the greed of people
user2: Man is always motivated by $.  Cover up so they won't lose any tourist money.
user1: Haha yeah
user1: It wouldn't do to lose business
user2: All this could have been avoided if they would just stay on land.  lol
user1: lmao yeah but i guess people love that salty ocean
user1: i doubt sharks even like human meat
user1: Hmm I think I would watch this movie because now I am curious of how they handle this sort of thing.
user2: The 3rd paragraph is great.  He puts a scuba tank into the sharks mouth and shoots the shark.  I can't see that happening.  
user1: lmao I that is a really amusing way to try to kill a shark
user2: Such a weak move to use a gun.  
user1: People aren't much without their guns
user1: And their weapons i guess
user2: Pretty cowardly, if you ask me. 
user1: i'd like to see someone wrestle a shark but that would probably end up badly
user1: It was enjoyable talking to you
user1: I never thought about this movie in that way so thanks

conversation:
user2: hi
user2: have you seen the movie Jaws?
user1: hi
user1: Yes, I have.
user1: Have you?
user2: yes, i did
user1: I think Steven Spielberg bringing Jaws to life considering that it was created in 1975
user1: I meant did a great job

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: What do you think about Jaws, the movie.
user1: Hi
user1: I don't think it sounds like something I would like
user1: Do you?
user2: I think it is a masterpiece of American Cinema
user2: Great directing, acting
user2: and the script was superb
user1: I know it's supposed to be scary, but it doesn't sound scary
user1: Ratings for it are good, but I have to wonder if that's just because it was good for it's time.
user1: Do you disagree?
user2: I disagree. 
user2: I think it has stood up the test of time.
user2: Spielberg did great, and the tech and effects were amazing for its time
user1: But "for it's time"... does that necessarily make for a good movie?
user2: I mean it pushed the envelope and was great back then, too. It is still great now. As long as you are not expecting marvel movies effects
user1: Nah, I don't need the effects to be amazing, but some of the older ones can really take me out of the movie.
user2: That is true. And this movie was a pioneer in its genre. I know it can be cheesy, but this one is not.
user1: The last line in that document is interesting. 
user2: Yeah it is
user2: won several academy awards too
user1: Really?
user1: Steven Spielberg has some good accomplishments
user2: He does
user1: I do enjoy some of his work.
user1: I didn't realize Richard Dreyfuss was in Jaws.
user1: Do you like him?
user2: I do, and I think he does great job
user1: I wonder if the movie follows the novel closely or not.
user1: Man, $10,000 was a lot of money in the 70's.
user2: it really was
user2: it isnt anything these days}
user1: Depends, I guess. I could live on that for almost a year.
user2: Well, so can I, but in terms of Hollywood money, its very little
user2: Most action movies cost hundreds of millions to make and advertise
user1: Right.
user1: You could still make a good movie with it, though.
user1: Some of my favorite films of last year were very low budget.
user2: Definitely! If you have the right cast, script and story. Primer is one of my favorite low budget movies
user2: Time travel made cheap
user1: Sounds like a good one.

conversation:
user1: Hey so this movie is Jaws, it's definitely a classic film, and has great reviews you should see it
user2: I saw it in New Jersey the year it came out
user2: I have only seen it twice.
user1: very cool, I've seen it a couple of times too
user1: I read the book that it was originally based on, the actual shark attacks that happened
user2: It wass funny, cause in my beachfront one could see Long Island from the shore. sort of. That is where Jaws is set.
user1: did it make you nervous about going out in the water?
user2: I remember that author Chricton  or somebody. Either way he scared us, I mean the movie did
user1: definitely, I bet it did
user2: OMG, peoiple stopped goig more than fifty feet.
user2: We had shark alerts, but the sharks were like 4 fett long only.
user1: I'm sure
user1: hahaha yes
user1: do they net the beaches up there?
user2: The bets part I remember was "we need a bigger boat"
user1: oh 100% it's the most memorable part of the film easily
user2: No, you are on your own. But there are watchers. Like Bay Watch. hah
user1: do they only run in slow motion? hahaha
user2: All the newspapers in our area started running shark stories.
user2: and yeah they seem to
user1: I get it, that would sell newspapers
user2: Some of the venders on the boardwalks started with Jaws menu items to, it was nuts
user1: I bet those things were popular
user2: In that defiance of danger way. But isn't there a part of the movie where people get hip to the big shark hunt and they are all like watching the heroes from the beach fight thte killer shark?
user1: yeah I think it's towards the end of the movie, it grips the whole town
user1: or the whole island I should say
user2: Exactly, that was the whole east coast back then. I was just 17 so i was all in.
user1: Oh for sure, you were in the right age for it all
user2: Yeah and I was having the beachlife in the summer cause there were girls from NYC there on vacation.
user1: hahaha of course
user2: But about the movie. When I saw it I wasn't prepared for how they got up close and personal with the shark attacks. Graphic for that age
user1: yeah it was definitely graphic for kids
user2: Honestly, I was more afraid of Jellyfish and used syringes on my beach
user2: you can really see where these Sharknado movies came from
user1: hahaha yes definitely
user1: well that should be it
user2: Any sharks in your present area. I traded down to the Great Lakes and nothing is dangerous i them
user2: OK
user1: have a good day :D

conversation:
user2: I think jaw is one of the greatest movie ever
user2: what do you think?
user1: I really think so too! which one is your favorite?
user2: I only ever watched the first one
user1: Honestly, the very first one is the best one
user1: Spielberg is a great director 
user2: I wish we could talk about his other movies too
user2: the material here doesnt give me much to work on
user2: Did you know it's based on a 1974 novel by Peter Benchley?
user1: I know haha
user1: And I actually didn't know that
user1: Have you read the book?
user2: No , I too just found out 
user2: You remember the opening scene?
user1: Did you watch the movie in the theaters?
user2: omg no 
user2: I wasn't born yet
user2: you?
user1: Same here haha. I watched it home with my mom
user1: I was so scared
user1: But I ended up really liking it 
user2: yeah , it works
user2: the shark is only for a short amount of time
user1: I love how they never really show the shark itself. Well, they do, but only for like a few times
user1: yeah!
user2: but the tension is through out the movie
user2: the shark hunter quotes a bounty of 10k for killing it
user1: It's the music that's why
user1: haha
user2: ends up dying 
user2: poor bastard
user1: How long ago did you watch the movie?
user2: like 4-5 years ago
user2: I watched it as a kid
user2: but didn't remember much of it
user2: but when I saw it recently
user2: wow
user2: a mastah peace
user2: The boat on which they hunt the whale is named Orca
user1: Have you gone to the Universals Studio tour? They talk a lot about Jaws
user1: That's funny
user1: Orca omg
user2: they are known to hunt great whites
user1: It's brilliant
user1: the small details
user2: I don't live in US so never had the chance
user2: what about you?
user1: I just went last week
user1: I have a pass
user2: that's awesome 
user1: But the tour guide was talking a lot about it
user2: what other things are there?
user2: they have a mechanical shark there , right?
user1: And how the suspense is created by the music itself
user1: Yes
user2: you are absolutely right about the music thing
user1: And it eats like a  human dummy in the water
user1: haha
user2: one of the most iconic music ever
user2: haha
user1: You know the person who created the music for jaws also created the music for harry potter, star wars and others? I'm not sure if i'm allowed to talk about those movies haha
user2: John Williams 
user1: yes!
user1: i forgot his name
user2: genius
user2: Brody stuffs a scuba tank in shark's mouth and shoots it
user2: what a badass way to kill a shark
user1: I don't remember that actually!
user1: I watched it so long ago
user2: Oh that is the best scene of the movie
user2: the shark tears apart "orca" 
user2: devours the shark hunter
user2: and as the boat is sinking
user2: brody comes up with this way to end the menace 
user1: omg that's great. that's they best way to defeat that shark

conversation:
user2: Hi! Have you ever seen the movie Jaws?
user1: Hello. No unfortunately I haven't seen this movie. Have you?
user1: It looks like it could be a cool gore/action type of film, what do you think?
user2: Yes I have. I originally saw it was I was twelve. It was very scary back then. Not so much now.
user2: It does not compare to the gore movies of today.
user2: I can believe you have not seen Jaws. Wow. How old are you?
user1: Yeah I know what you mean, I was rewatching the movie "Carrie" the other day that seemed scary when I first saw it around the age of 7. But now in my 30's it's just not as scary or interesting.
user2: I know what you mean. I am in my fifties. When I saw the Jaws the first time it was the scariest movie have had ever seen. Now it is sort of funny with the fake shark.
user1: I am 40. I saw quite a few movies but Jaws was one that somehow slipped through the cracks. I've been to the Universal Studios "Jaws" set drive through that was kind of cool though. Have you ever been there. Yeah by today's standards seems like it could be kind of a campy film.
user1: Yeah I love the modern comedy movie's that spoof alot of other films!
user2: No I have not. Funny after I saw it, I wanted to be a marine biologist for a while. I lived in New England.
user1: HaHa, yeah one thing I can say about alot of the 1980's films is they were creative and original, rather than all these sequels trilogies and remakes going on now.
user2: Have you ever seen any of scenes of the movies. I was really popular. The first scene with the girl swimming was awesome.
user2: We used to redo the scene when we were kids in the pool. Her being pulled under by the shark.
user2: Then of course, people would try to scare you at the beach by sneaking up under you while you were in the water. Do you live where there are lots of beaches?
user1: Yeah the theatrical trailors made it seem kind of compelling like who was going to make it out alive. I definitely remember the theme beat of the shark movement "dun dun dun dun" type of thing. What do you think of this critical response where it says "not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims" was that true were the characters kind of flat in the movie?
user2: I felt sympathy for the victims. Maybe not for the fisherman trying to kill the shark though.
user1: I live in Texas now so the closest thing is creeks and lakes but I used to live in southern California and yeah I grew up with that constant scare of sharks at the beach (probably made bigger than the actuality because of this movie) although realistically I only got to go maybe once every four years if I was lucky.
user1: So almost a Moby Dick kind of feel with the fisherman trying to kill the shark. So you disagree then with that reviewers opinion?
user2: Yes. I thought it was a great movie. I also read the book. It was suppose to be a modern day Moby Dick.
user2: Quint, the old fisherman, who get eaten by the shark at the end is my favorite character. 
user1: Have you ever seen one of the "Creepshow" films of the time where a giant blob in the ocean was pulling people under including their cars, where no one survived? I don't know why but as a kid that one was kind of scary and reminds me of a "Jaws" type category feel. 
user2: No, I never saw that movie. There were tons of rip offs to Jaws. One was about a giant Octopus. it was laughable.
user1: Yean there were alot of camp movies in the 1980's that were bad acting but pretty funny to watch whether they intended to be or not.
user2: You should really try to see the original Jaws. it was one of Spielbergs best. 
user1: Yeah there are certain movies where you feel more connection to the "bad guy" character rather than the supposed victim or "good guy" character just because those characters seem so vapid. I really liked a movie called "Valentine" with David Boreanaz that I thought was from the 1990's along those lines.
user2: I think I might have seen the sequel to that movie. Was it about a mine?
user1: I will put "Jaws" on my to see watch-list. I have two children that are in early elementary and I am having them watch some of the movies I liked as a kid or that remind me of generations growing up if it's good enough when they get older I may add this to that list.
user1: You know what, I'm not sure. I wasn't aware they had a sequel to "Valentine" but then again what don't they make sequel's to now-a-days to where it probably was. Was the part 2 good as well in your opinion?
user2: Lol. The kids today are growing up with Shark Week. When I watched with my young daughter and her friend they laughed at me when I told them to hide their eyes. They knew what real great whites looked like. I think the movie I saw was a sequel or remake of the original Valentine. Very campy. It was good.
user1: This article just list's a basic summary of the film it would be a pretty dull conversation to just pull the facts from this sheet. Do you have any interesting comments or questions you can think from it? I can't think how to do this assignment by just following this synapsis sheet personally.
user2: I know. Especially since you did not see the movie. Did you pick Jaws?
user2: It is hard to engage with the predetermine sheets they want us to use.
user2: I am trying to get some of the factoids in but it is difficult. 
user1: Shark Week haha that's cute. Yeah the school's are more exciting at least for the kids with all the themes they create for them. No I think it was just random, I agree. Well I think we met the 15 line minimum, what do we do now? I'm glad I got to talk to you, it was interesting.
user2: Me too. We have one more paragraph to go over. Number four. They need better directions for this task. Last person just gave up because she did not know we have four paragraphs. 
user2: Let me tell you. At the end of the movie, when the character Brody finally kills the shark, the whole audience cheered. 
user2: I have never been to a movie where the audience cheered. 
user1: Sorry would you mind explaining to me what we do further to close out this task? I may have misunderstood but I thought we basically discussed the movie detailed in the summary of at least 15 comments and that was basically the end of the assignment, is there another sheet to read and discuss as well? I agree with you I just want to make sure we get the credit of completing this turk. I'm sorry the other Mturker just "boned out" to quote Bender from Futurama. Haha this Brody guy wasn't too great then huh?
user1: I guess this is the end?

conversation:
user2: hello?
user1: You should watch Jaws the movie from 1974 when you get a chance
user2: Is that the original jaws or not sure?
user1: Yes the original movie based from the book
user2: a book! holy cow. It sounds interesting, is it about a dentist?
user1: It is a thriller by Steven Spielberg that got an average of 9/10 on many different critic sites. I do not kno about the dentist 
user2: 90% sounds like a pretty damn good score. Dentist thing was a joke, get it JAWS. Are there any actors that I might be familiar with in the movie?
user1: Ohh i get it now thats a good one.
user1: It is about a small resort town needing to get rid of the sharks around their resort
user2: oh man, i doubt they have a dentist at the resort. Thats a sticky situation to be in. Do they mention any actors that might be in it?
user2: I'm a big fan of steven spielberg though
user1: They send out a police chief with a marine biologist and professional shark hunter.
user2: It sounds good though, it was made in 1974 right?
user1: Matt Hooper, Murray Hamilton as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. This is the cast
user1: Yes it was in 74 and still holds up today
user2: wow that seems like quite a long time ago, do you have any movies that are similar you could recommend?
user1: The remake that was made years later would be a good option
user2: Have you read the book? how does the book hold up to the movie?
user1: Sharknado if you want more of a ridiculous comedy version
user1: I have never read the book but Im sure it holds more to offer than the movie does in suspense
user2: yeah thats probably true, have you ever personally seen the movie?
user1: I have only seen the remake of the movie and it was really good. So i am sure with Spielberg directing it was great.
user2: Yeah spielberg is pretty great, are you also a fan of his other films?
user1: I have heard a lot of great things but do not typically pay attention to who made them. Im sure I have seen and enjoyed some though
user2: yeah Its unsual for me to look for the director too. I heard though at the oscars steven speilberg has been thanked more then god
user1: I do not keep up with award shows
user2: me either, it was a fun fact I saw on imgur so who knows if its true. I mean you have kind of convinced me that jaws is worth the watch. atleast the orginal is because I don't like the older movies unless theyre a comedy like blazing saddles or young frankenstein, do you know how long you have to try and persuade me for?
user2: I thought it was 12 messages between each other which I think we have certainly acheived but It also mentioned different movies
user1: I think it is a certain amount of replies, but am not too sure

conversation:
user1: hello

user2: thats pretty good
user1: Yeah it really does .  
user1: have you seen other movies directed by steven spielberg
user2: I have, I liked how Spielberg directs movies, what is your favorite actor in the movie?
user1: Roy was my favorite actor
user1: how about yoU >
user2: I liked Matt Hooper, I thinnk Richard Drefuss is a great actor
user2: But Roy had a great performance as well
user1: yeah he is very good 
user2: What key scene was your favorite?
user2: I liked the one at the beach party
user1: I just noticed jaws got 8/10 on IMDB thats pretty good 
user1: Mine was the beach party scene as well
user2: Yeah! it has pretty good ratings, and also a Metacritics score of 87/100
user2: that tells you a lot about a movie
user1: yeah it does i might have to re watch this movie sometime
user2: Yeah, it never gets old, I also liked the scene with when they ser out on Quint's boat to hunt the shark
user2: It was a pretty awesome scene
user1: Yeah i agree that was a great scene ! 
user1: Do you own the movie ?
user2: Actually I dont, I would like to buy it though, its a classic thats worth keeping at home
user1: yeah it is
user1: I dont own it either but i should
user2: Yeah I think its worthwhile, it has great ratings and also great critics responses
user2: its weird to see a movie with those ratings now a days
user1: yeah it is very rare to see that now days

conversation:
user2: Using man-eating great white sharks was a good way to hook in viewers!
user1: Yes it was a great way to hook the audience
user2: I'm glad I didn't watch it with my niece, it was to gruesome for kids.
user1: The use of Great white sharks appealed to the audiences primal fear of massive strong sea creatures
user1: I was definitely terrified as child watching and equally as an adult
user2: That's the thing about thrillers though, we get the thrill factor we are looking for! Especially when it came to Jaws.
user1: Yes I agree and Steven Spielberg is amazing at bringing our fears to life
user2: Most filmmakers lack in talent when compared to Steven Spielberg, that's for sure.
user1: Steven Spielberg is pretty much the best at thrillers I look forward to seeing any movie that 
user1: he is connected to
user1: Roy Scheider was perfect for his role as Chief Martin Brody
user2: I totally agree. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Martin.
user1: Roy Scheider gave the audience sheer terror in his eyes and that made the movie 
user1: I can't imagine anyone else playing that character
user2: Neither could I . I would have been frightened seeing someone's partial remains on the beach. 
user1: The movie started off with a bang so to speak the first attack was pretty much almost immediate
user1: which is another reason that the movie itself was so terrifying
user1: From the first attack the audience was hooked to see what else would happen but afraid to know at the same time
user2: When everyone learned about the shark attack, I would have put as much money that I could afford to hire a bounty hunter for sharks to! 
user1: the makings of a perfectly executed thriller
user1: I know the first thought would have been to hire a hunter or hunters to take the shark out of the water
user2: The beach was basically useless with the shark attacks happening. I wouldn't have dared to back until I knew the waters were safe.
user1: the attacks happened so rapidly and suddenly without warning it was terrifying to imagine 
user1: I agree I would have been done with the beach at that point
user2: And then for them to find a shark tooth in a human skull?? That is terrifying.
user1: they continued to go to the beach even with the warnings, with every thing they saw including the skull they continued
user1: they were fighting against the sharks natural flow 
user2: Which was pretty much pointless.
user1: it was and dangerous 
user2: I would have hired Quint immediately! 10,000 is nothing when it comes to the use of a public beach for all.
user1: When the first attack happened they should have shut it down to investigate and capture the shark but they wanted to get business and the beach was a major source there
user1: They were having a beach party at dusk that was a no no
user2: Money over lives is the most stupid. And that is the biggest no no with shark attacks going on. I would have been nervous when the shark appeared behind the boat. 
user1: yes I would have froze with fear
user2: And then to get in a cage and go underwater? You have to be out of your mind to do that. 
user1: oh god yes I agree
user1: I wouldn't have done that not at all
user1: The sharks can get to you even in that cage 
user2: Neither would I. I would have assumed that the shark could get through it from the jump  
user1: what about coming out of the cage to get out the water
user2: Exactly! You never know what's going to happen. 
user1: at some point the person would have to come out of the cage and sharks swarm until they get what they want
user1: The excitement and fear of Jaws is a masterpiece even with the gore 
user1: I could have never took a swim in that water after the first shark sighting it would have been off limits for me

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hello
user2: What is the name of the movie you read about 
user1: The movie is Jaws
user2: Is it the original 
user1: It is the original 1975  jaws directed by Steven Spielbrg
user2: I’ve actually have never seen it
user1: Really? Well let me tell you about it
user1: its about a giant man eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity Island 
user2: I didn’t know Spielberg directed that movi
user1: the town is a fictional new england summer town 
user2: I have seen clips of it and it looks a bit outdated lol.
user1: Basically a beach party on amity island where a woman named chrissie watkns goes skinny dipping in the ocean. 
user1: While she is treasinf water she is violently pulled under. The next day her remains are scatterd
user2: Let me guess she gets eaten by a shark
user1: well it was filmed in 1975
user1: a local professional shark hunter has offered his services for $10,000.00 to catch the shark. And back to Chrissie a consulting oceanographer named Matt Hopper examines the remains and determines it is a great white
user2: I think speilberg did a lot better on his other movies like et  but your right the special effects were not like they are today 
user1: so they think they have caught a shark because local fishermen have caught a tiger shark.
user1: The mayor thinks and delcares the beach safe letting people enter the water again. 
user1: Although Hopper disputes the shark found as being the predator because no human remains were found in the shark 
user2: Yuk
user2: Who’s in that movie 
user1: So they go searching, and they find a half sunken vessel with a great whites shark tooth....he drops the tooth when he sees the partial corpse 
user1: Well the main character is Roy Schneider and it also has Richard Dreyfuss
user1: Some juveniles decide to play a prank while the deputys son is in the water and the shark enters back into the estuary killing a boater and causing the son to go into shock
user2: Ic I’m not really into shark movies but a lot of people seem to like jaws 
user1: They finally decide to hire the $10,000 shark hunter
user2: Have you seen the movie 
user1: So the 3 main characters set out on a boat called the Orca. They are trying to pull the shark in and bring him to the water where they are. Without warning the shark appears from the back 
user1: i have
user2: Do you like it
user1: and i would recommend it, its a classic 
user2: I’m more into movies like the shining and clockwork orange but i think jaws is definitely a cult classic 
user1: So basically they are able to lure the shark and the shark hunter gets devoured 
user1: brody attempts to kill it using  a spear, that does not work and then puts a pressurized scuba tank in its mouth and shoots the shark with a rifle and blows up

conversation:
user1: Hi, there! Remember that old movie Jaws? Did you see it?
user2: Yes! It’s been forever since I’ve seen that movie 
user1: Same here. Remember, it stars Roy Scheider. You should really see it again. I'd even forgotten it was directed by Stephen Spielberg until recently!
user2: Oh you’re right! I think it was his first block buster! All I can remember is the scary music 
user1: Ha ha! That's great!  Richard Dreyfuss is in it, too. I'd say it was the real thriller of 1975!
user2: It’s been that long! How does the technology hold up?
user1: Well, I'd say that since they consider the most frightening sequences to be those without the shark, either the technology doesn't hold up, or it does a great job regardless!
user2: Oh you’re right! The music did build that tension. Wasn’t John Williams the composer for that film?
user1: You know, I honestly don't know. Seems kind of unfair, down't it. It's funny that the island they work on is Amity Island since it's a thriller-type movie, though, isn't it?
user2: Yah I remember the location being the selling point since so many people were intrigued by just that!
user1: Pulled under at a beach party on the island. I"m sure that impacted a lot of people's summer fun. I really need to watch it again. A professional shark hunter? How do you get to be that and charge $10,000? Anyway, I gotta see it again! You should see it again, too! Always good to refresh in retrospect.
user2: Seriously! My family are avid watcher of films so I would put that film up for consideration 
user1: Poor shark has a bounty on his head. All he wants to do is eat vacationers. I mean, it's his job, right? I say watch it and root for the shark. None of the people are very sympathetic, anyway, and he has to defend his fin from the Diner's Club set.
user2: You know I can recall alway being on the sharks side. The crew was kinda more corrupted if you think about it 
user1: I totally agree. How about the amateur shark-hunting frenzy that the second death sets off? Whose water is it, anyway????? Defending its home is what I say.
user2: You’re right and who just swims in the middle of the night (that lady) in the ocean not expecting something bad to happen? She was in shark territory 
user1: Totally! And how about the mayor protecting the tourism trade by declaring the beaches safe as soon as a couple of local fisherman catch a shark, even though no human remains are found in it.
user2: Maybe the message of the film was showing the idiocy and greed of people or so called sharks manifesting into actuall shark attacks 
user1: I totally agree. They do find a big shark tooth in the hull of a sunken boat, though, which probably made some little kid somewhere happy. Of course when the beach is packed for the 4th of July, the real shark strikes again!
user2: Interesting! I totally going to rewatch this film now in a newer perspective!
user1: Same here. You know, I think it was a mistake to drop and abandon that shark's tooth, though, when he sees the corpse. I can understand being jarred by the partial corpse, but he should have totally put that tooth in his trunks. He could definitely have eBayed it in a few decades. I wonder if today they would close the beaches or just add additional safety precautions like they did in the movie (which resulted in the July 4 debacle). I can't tell if safety or tourism would win out!
user2: You know that’s true with that! And the island was some sort of attraction too! It like even though we don’t like danger. Us humans always still want to face it. I need to analyze this movie more 
user1: I think it's great that they name their boat that they hunt the shark in the "Orca."
user2: Why do you think they used that water creature to label their ship?
user1: I don't know, probably out of respect for sea creatures, ha ha!!! Anyway, I consider it poetic justice when the shark devours the bounty hunter who's after him. 
user2: Yes! They seemed meaner than the shark which as discussed may have been the intention all along
user1: I agree. They have to stuff a pressurized scuba tank in his mouth and then shoot it from afar, causing it, and the shark, to explode. Totally rude. 
user2: Yes but hey those sequels show that the shark had the last laugh since their babies took the reigns 
user1: Really? I didn't know that! That's awesome! Well, I guess if the shark got it in the end, at least he told them that they can call anything they want to a "shark proof cage," but that don't mean nothing. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey! Have you ever seen Jaws? Its a really good movie. Its a little bit older...1975. Its a thriller type of movie and directed by Steven Spielberg so you know its got to be good.
user2: That sounds like a great movie.  Does it have a good ending?
user1: Yes, they end up killing the shark but through out the movie there is shark attacks and is not suitable for children.
user1: IMDB gave this movie a 97% rating!
user2: Okay, so it sounds like it's a movie only for the grown ups and adults.  That means it's rated R, right?
user1: Yes. It is R Rated.
user2: That's a really great rating, I am definitely interested in seeing it.
user1: Awesome! You wont regret it.
user2: Do you know how long the movie is?
user1: I dont have the exact run time but I would think its between 2 and three hours long.
user2: Okay great, I want to make sure to watch a movie that has a well developed story line that's at least longer than two hours.
user1: Heres a description of one of the scenes: A beach party takes place at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkinsgoes skinny dipping in the ocean. While treading water, she is violently pulled under. Thenext day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death ashark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughnoverrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy.
user1: I like that scene the best becasue it was so much action and gore. Im really into those types of movies.
user2: Yeah, it sounds like it has a lot of action and drama.
user2: Do you have any other movies to recommend?
user1: Yes, It has alot of great ratings. Rotten tomatoes gave it 97% and Metacritics gave them 87/100/.
user1: I think this is the top rated movie that I wuld recomend.
user2: I'm sure with a movie that has a great score like that, it surely spawned a lot of sequels.
user1: Oh yes! There are a few movies in this sequel. In the second movie one of the local fishermen cath a tiger shark and the mayor gives them the beach back, saying its fage and no human remains were found inside. A few days later a couple kids found a great white tookth so they knew there was something going on. I like the intensity of that scene.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: Are know how to complete this task
user1: Did you read the directions?
user2: Yes! you
user1: Yeah, let's begin.
user2: Okay
user1: Personally, I think the movie Jaws is a classic. I would have to agree with the 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
user2: You are right! And IMDB Rating to high
user2: Key Scenes
user2: offers his services for $10,000.
user2: Do you generally watch movies with (good/bad) ratings?
user1: I like all of the main characters, but Robert Shaw that plays Quint is my favorite. I feel like a key scene is when they are inside the boat at night and he is talking about his experience in a secret military mission where a shark eats them one by one.
user1: Yeah, I tend to pay attention to the ratings.
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie? 
user1: I can't believe how the mayor of the town refuses to close beaches out of fear of ruining the town's summer economy.
user1: Yes, I agree with the high ratings.
user2: My openion is this is amazing movie
user1: It appears as though the coroner is being persuaded by the mayor to rule the girl's death a boating accident when it was clearly a shark that killed her.
user2: Introduction Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley's1974 novel of the same name.
user1: I have to say I do not care for the mayor. He is corrupt.
user2: I think so.
user2: I think we need to finish this conversation because this is amazing movie.
user1: I mean, the guy insisted on having the beaches full of people on the fourth of July and of course someone gets killed and Brody's son, Michael, goes into shock after almost being eaten by a shark that day.
user1: I do not think we have met our quota of responses.
user2: As your wish
user1: I think the mechanical shark that that ends up destroying Quint's boat was incredibly built and worked.
user1: The film was made in 1975 and that thing looks better than a lot of similar creations in movies today even with all of the technology.

conversation:
user2: What is your favorite movie?
user1: hmmm....in the mouth of madness, maybe :)
user2: I never heard of that movie but it sounds interesting!
user1: So Jaws is ag reat movie tho you should check it out
user2: I really like that movie. I will!
user1: Yeah it's about a shark attacking beachgoers in the 70's
user2: The first one was good, but I wasn't a fan of the others
user1: yeah me either. lame sauce. 
user1: funny that back then they thought of this movie as "too gruesome" for children
user2: Yeah, compared to today it's far less gruesome!!
user2: It did scare me to go to the beach when I was younger!!
user1: it rates 8/10 on imdb
user1: though rotten tomatoes go higher with almost 100% rating lol
user1: also has richard dreyfuss in it
user2: It deserve that rating 
user1: i agree
user2: I don't know much of the actors in that movie though so that is intersting
user2: Where was that movie set in?
user2: I forgot completely!!
user1: hmmmm lemme check, some beach side place of course
user2: I think it was somewhere in New England, but I'm not sure
user1: Amity Island in new england
user1: a fictional town mind ye
user2: Oh okay, that is what I thought
user1: the scene where they spear thhe sharrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrk is inteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeense
user2: Yeahhhh!!!!!
user1: i mean

user1: ARE STILL THEIR?

conversation:
user1: Jaws has a rating of 8/10 on IMDb. Did you agree with that high rating?
user2: Yes, an 8/10 rating sounds accurate from the interpretation of the critics.  
user2: What do you think about the suspense of this movie?
user1: It was thrilling, but also funny. The humor helped ease the suspense.
user2: I also like the humor aspect of a thriller.  The anxiety makes the funny scenes much more enjoyable
user2: What do you think about the comparison to Woody Allen?
user1: I don't agree with that comparison. I wonder if that was a review written in the 70s, because I didn't see the Jaws humor as being so verbal as Allen's.
user1: Did you think Jaws was exploitative?
user2: I completely agree with you about the Woody Allen comment.  I don't see it, either.  The idea of Jaws can be a bit exploitative.  The idea of an evil, killer shark is not completely realistic to every day life.  There are such a small percentage of shark attacks, and the shark is often not trying to kill the person.
user1: That is a very good point. 
user2: If a person were watching Jaws in our time period, do you think the comment "too gruesome for children" would still apply?
user1: I think so, because of the jump scare with the head.
user2: Yeah, me too.  I want my kids to be interested in swimming and the ocean.  I think a killer shark would freak them out.
user1: The horror genre has been very influenced by the conflict between the sheriff and the mayor. That was one of the best parts about the plot to me, the frustration, and I guess the dramatic irony of knowing how bad the shark is from the beginning.
user2: Yes, the best movies have those great character struggles.  The acting also helps make those feelings known.
user2: Who is your favorite actor in Jaws?
user1: Definitely Robert Shaw. When he got everyone's attention during the meeting...what a way to introduce a character!
user2: Great choice.  I am partial to Richard Dreyfuss, but I feel that there are many greats in the line-up.
user2: It is hard to believe this movie came out in 1975.
user1: I love that scene with Dreyfus and Shaw singing. Yes, it really holds up well. I actually saw it for the first time this summer in a re-release in the theater and it was just as good as any modern horror to me.
user2: I was going to say that it would be fun to watch in the theater.  I would be interested to see it in a re-release.  It would be a blast.
user2: It is amazing what can be done with suspense without using gore and buckets of blood.
user1: My dad screamed and spilled his popcorn when the head floated up.
user2: That's awesome.  It has just enough details to cause that reaction without making you want to throw up.
user2: Spielberg had a perfect balance.
user1: It's easy to forget how good Spielberg is, I guess I take him for granted. Jaws gave me a new appreciation, you could see how he got so huge.
user2: Yes.  I have taken film class, and we had the opportunity to make a few films.  You can really see the wonderful techniques that someone like Spielberg adopted.  The angles, music, and various other aspects keep the viewer intense.
user1: They really got creative with all the ways they tried to kill the shark at the end!
user1: What angles did he use that were unique in Jaws?
user1: Ooo, there is a review on this document that says we don't feel sympathy for the victims. I don't agree with that. 
user2: One example of the filming was the boy on the beach.  Spielberg is capturing the whole scene of the beach, but he is following the boy at the same time.
user2: Yeah, it is hard to not feel for the victim.  It would not put us personally in the movie if we could not relate to the characters.
user1: I'm going to have to watch this again.
user2: Me too.

conversation:
user1: This movie is a classic, after seeing the movie I don't swim in the ocean anymore.
user2: Really. I seem to recall a movie about Sharks that scared the hell out of everyone when it was released.
user1: I watched this movie a very long time ago, and it really scared me.
user2: Was it abour sharks?
user1: Yes and how it attacked people.
user2: What is it called?
user1: Jaws really scary movie.
user2: Yeah, a classic, I hear. I'm thinking of seeing it. 
user1: Good for you, I bet you will like it.
user2: Who is in it?
user1: A fellow Turker>
user2: Now that's interesting. Turkers can always smell a shark. 
user1: Sorry I miss read it, Richard Dreyfuss was staring in it.
user2: Dreyfuss is good. How does it compare to newer scary movies?
user1: Now think about when this movie came out 1975 for that time it was scary.
user2: So, is it scary for this time?
user1: Yes pretty much so. Now if they made a remake with all the new graphics and everything it would be even better.
user2: Yeah I could see that. But it looks like they got top-flight actors for the original. That's hard to replace.
user1: Your right, I do think they made a Jaws 2, I never saw it. Did you?
user2: No, didn't see that either. Usually the first is the best.
user1: Your right, the equals always lack something.
user2: What was the best part of the movie?
user1: This young woman is pulled under by a shark and they close the beach and is overruled and keeps the beach open someone else gets killed and the shark hunt is afoot.
user2: Was it bloody?
user1: Somewhat, not as some of the newer movies, butt bloodly.
user2: Good date movie?
user1: Ya, if you're going with someone special you can get close.
user2: What movie would you compare it to?
user1: I would compare it with I really don't know. It is really one of a kind.

conversation:
user1: hey man, Jaws received really good reviews
user2: I heard about that
user1: It's about a giant man eating shark, er, eating people.  You should watch it.
user2: when did you see it?
user1: I forgot, but it's directed by Steven Spielberg.  It's got Roy Schneider in it too.
user2: are the special effects really good in the movie?
user2: are you still there?

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: Have you ever seen the 1975 version of the movie Jaws?
user1: Hi
user1: yes I have seen Jaws
user2: Did you like the movie?
user1: yes it was a good movie considering it came out in 1975
user1: do you like the director of the movie?
user2: I love old movies! 
user2: His name sounds familiar.
user2: Do you know what other movies he has directed?
user2: Do you like him?
user1: Steven Spielberg is an awesome director
user1: did he make e.t.?
user2: I am not sure lol. 
user2: What did you like about the movie Jaws?
user1: the actors were good Richard Dreyfuss was in it 
user2: I googled steven spielberg movies. He also produced E.T. & Jurassic Park :D
user1: I liked when they started going shark hunting searching for jaws 
user2: Oh and "Catch Me if you Can" with Leonardo Dicaprio
user2: I feel like the movie falsely represents sharks. Sure they are carnivorous but I don't believe they are viscous beings. 
user1: in most cases no, but Jaws wasn't most cases that shark was out for blood
user1: what was your favorite part of the movie
user2: It was honestly so long ago I don't really remember much.
user2: I liked when the shark killed the people who were hunting it.
user2: He probably knew how destructive the human species was becoming.
user1: back when this came out critics said it was too gruesome for kids but I dont think its any worse than whats out now
user1: maybe
user2: Agreed.
user1: how long were we supposed to stay in the chat for
user2: I feel like nobody should be censored
user2: We have to wait until the "Finish Conversation" button shows up.

user2: Like, I bet a lot of people gained the fear of surfing after this movie came out.

user1: Will that's go to know
user2: The second one is pretty decent as well. I didn't enjoy it as much as the original though.
user1: How many parts are there for jaws
user2: I think its 3 different ones. I haven't seen the 3rd one I don't think.
user2: I know the first 2 have the same main actor who is  the police chief.

conversation:
user1: I went to see Jaws with my girlfriend and in the beginning of the movie she was offended and left.
user2: Why was she offended? The movie eas great gor it's time.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: What movie is this about?
user1: hello!  the movie is "jaws".  it's an excellent film, and has earned a rating of 97% on rotten tomatoes.  
user2: Who is in it?
user1: you will love the cast - Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as Quint, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, and Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody.  the film was also directed by award-winning director Steven Spielberg. 
user2: Is this a fairly new movie?
user1: not really.  it was released in 1975.  however, the story is timeless.  it's about a giant man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity Island in New England. 
user2: Sounds interesting. How long is it?
user1: i'm not sure about the length of the movie.  but it's so thrilling, i doubt you will be watching the clock!
user2: My kind of movie. Do you think it is okay for kids?
user1: Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable atany age.
user2: Cool. Definitely want to see it. Is it streaming anywhere?
user1: maybe you can check online!  make sure you check out the beach party scene at the beginning of the movie.  
user2: intense?
user1: definitely!  chrissie watkins is attending the party on amity island, she goes skinny dipping and is pulled under water by the shark!
user2: The story sounds like horror but the cast sounds like drama. Combo?

conversation:
user2: Hi, let's talk about Jaws!
user1: Jaw's was a fantastic movie and just some of the great work that Stephen Spielberg has done
user2: I agree. Hard to believe it was released all the way back in 1975 :o
user2: It holds up well today.
user1: Yes it does. I think that is a tribute to the cast and to the director. 
user2: Roy Scheider is very good.
user2: So's Richard Dreyfuss.
user1: As was Richard Dreyfuss. I've always enjoyed his work
user2: I think Robert Shaw as Clint kind of steals the show though.
user2: He's great as the shark hunter.
user1: What about Jaws himself? The technology that they were able to put into the film gave it a great sense of realism.
user2: The shark looks very good considering that it is 1975 special effects. 
user1: Exactly. This was way before CGI and high definition. It almost gives it a more real feel than movies today. 
user2: At the time it was incredibly scary to people, having the shark jump out of the water
user2: But I think it was just as good when the shark wasn't around, the anticipation.
user1: Especially when added to that killer simple piano music. 
user1: I can still hear it in my head.
user2: Great score.
user2: Remember the opening scene, with the girl going out and skinny dipping?
user2: So startling when she is suddenly pulled under.
user1: Yes I do. The police rule it a boating accident, but Richard Dreyfuss' character suspects it was more
user2: Then the mayor gets scared, and they place a bounty out on sharks.
user1: It's sad that they find the tiger shark and believe it to be the source of the attack.
user2: And the fishermen catch that tiger shark, but we know that isn't the right shark.
user2: And so does Brody, and the Dreyfuss character.
user1: That's why they go exploring and find that half-sunken ship. 
user2: Yeah the ship, with the shark's tooth.
user1: They find the sharks tooth which clearly wasn't from a tiger shark. 
user2: Imagine what kind of shark it would take, to sink a boat :s
user2: Very scary.
user1: Indeed.
user1: A very big great white I would imagine.
user1: Just like the one that they went hunting for on the boat
user1: The Orca
user2: The hunt on the boat is terrific.
user1: Right, especially when the shark gets a hold of the line and starts to sink the boat
user2: And Dreyfuss is in the water  swimming around, what was he thinking?
user2: It's so upsetting when Qunit slides into the shark's mouth.
user1: He thought that the shark cage would protect him unfortuantely that proved to be a terrible mistake. 
user2: Yeah :(
user2: But Brody manages to shoot that CO2 cylinder and that's that for the shark.
user1: It's unfortunate when Quit get's eaten while he was trying to subdue the shark. 
user2: Poor Quint.
user2: But Brody avenges him :)
user2: Great film.
user1: Yes he does. 
user1: Very great film. 
user2: Thanks for talking with me about it today.
user2: Glad we agree :)
user1: You're welcome. I enjoyed the chat. 
user2: Take care now.
user2: Me too.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi. Have you seen the movie Jaws?
user2: Yes, it is a classic movie
user2: Have you?
user1: I am thinking of seeing it. I am a fan of thriller movies. 
user2: Oh ok it came out in 1975
user2: directed by steven Spielberg 
user2: its a true american classic
user1: Yeah. That was before I was born. He's a great director and the movie gets great reviews online. 
user1: I like Richard Dreyfuss as well. 
user2: yea hes a good acto
user2: actor
user1: Is this too gory for children to watch?
user2: no its ok i think
user2: i think when the shark attacks the first woman its not that gory
user1: What other types of movies do you enjoy?
user2: i like thriller and action movies also
user2: do you like movies like jaws?
user1: Does this compare to any other movies you can think of?
user2: where its a animal ro monster attacking
user2: or
user1: Sure. 
user2: yea this movie is like free willy but a little more violent
user1: I'm not sure that's a comparison I would have expected. 
user1: I thought this was more of a horror film. Where people at the beach get attacked.
user2: yes people are getting attacked
user1: Isn't there a famous line "I Think we're gonna need a bigger boat." 
user2: yes that is a famous lie
user2: line
user2: i like all movie by steven speilbergs
user2: all the plots are good and excitin
user2: exciting
user1: Yes. It sounds like it should be one of the better films Spielberg made. 
user2: yes it was a big hit at that time
user1: From what I'm reading here it says it's probably too gruesome for children. So I may have to watch it when the kids go to bed.
user2: from last time i remember it wasnt that gruesome
user2: but yea its probably best if you watch it without the kids first
user1: I didn't realize this was based on a novel by the same name.
user2: yes the movie is based on the novel

conversation:
user2: Jaws is a classic!
user1: Certainly is, it has made me fear the water ever since seeing it as a child.
user2: Definitely a movie I'd like to watch again sometime, havnt seen it in years
user1: would you consider this a horror film?
user2: Umm...hm. Respectfully, compared to others no not really. 
user2: Would you

conversation:
user1: Hi.  My name is Sandy.
user2: Hi Sandy, I'm Ashley 
user2: If you haven't seen Jaws yet, you need to! Such a great movie. A classic!
user1: Oh, yes!  It's one of my favorites.  I actually have the DVD.
user1: Do you have any favorite parts in that movie?
user2: I can't believe it's been over 40 years ago since it was released (1975). 
user1: Yeah...makes me feel really old.  lol
user2: It's hard to pick just one favorite!... I know! 
user2: I still don't like swimming in the ocean because of Jaws. 
user1: I watched it on the big screen when it first came out.  I was 13 years old at the time.  Scared me so much, I didn't even want to take a bath for a couple of months.  :D
user2: I didn't realize that it was actually based off a book. Stephen Spielberg did such a great job directing. 
user1: Yes.  I had read the book first, so sort of knew what to expect.  
user2: I need to watch it again, my kids are a little young to see it though, since it's so gruesome. 
user1: Richard Dryfuss was exceptional in that movie.  He added the right amount of humor to it.
user2: Lorraine Gary fit the character of Ellen Brody so well. 
user1: Yes, she did.  When I watch it these days, I kinda have to laugh because the shark looks so robotic.  Can you imagine if they made the original today with how far they've come in movie making.  It would look so real! 
user2: It really would be a great movie to be remade. But then again, it would be hard to beat the first. 
user2: The first one was so highly rated. 
user1: Yes, hard to remake an original.Now...is Jaws the movie we are supposed to be reviewing.  I didn't see where they asked us to talk about Jaws, did you?
user2: I am supposed to be talking about Jaws. 
user2: I'm sure they couldn't do a re-make that would do the original Jaws justice. Spielberg just has a talent most directors now days could only dream about having. 
user1: Okay, just wanted to be sure.  Thanks.Actually, one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Richard Dreyfuss watches Quincy crush the soda can with his bare hands and then Richard crushes his Styrofoam cup in his hand to act macho. lol 
user1: Yeah...I haven't really found a Steven Spielberg movie that I didn't love.  He is great!
user1: If you watch the DVD, I believe they even have bloopers/behind-the-scenes from the movie at the end. 
user2: I wonder how many movies he's directed in his career? 
user1: I'd guess over 50.  Some of which we may not have heard of if they were in his much younger days.
user2: The part where the girl that's skinny dipping gets pulled under.... I had nightmares about for weeks after seeing it!
user1: YES!  I used to go out in the water as far as she did in that movie.  I never did that again afterwards.
user1: How about when the human head popped out of that sunken boat's hole??
user1: Scared the bajeebers outta me!!
user2: Oh my word. I screamed ... thankfully I didn't see it in theaters!
user1: And when that one guys leg floated down to the bottom of the ocean.  Yikes!
user1: I did like that they used some actual shark footage to make it look more real.
user2: Yeah! That was terrifying. 
user2: Just thinking about it makes the hair on my arms stand up.
user1: Absolutely!  That was the first shark movie I ever saw and it set the stage for so man more shark movies to follow.  Some of the sequels did get a little ridiculous to watch, right?
user2: I don't think I ever saw any sequels. 
user1: The 3D one was so silly.  :D
user2: Now I never watch thrillers. It's always more kid friendly movies. 
user1: Nothing beats the orig
user1: Did you leave, Ashley?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello. Do you like monster movies or thrillers?
user1: I like thriller movies. 
user2: I want to recommend Jaws, then. It's fast-paced and the characters are very interesting. It leaves you on the edge of your seat
user1: Cool. Just how I like a movie. 
user1: What's the main character is like?
user2: He's a very well-developed police chief
user2: Played by Roy Scheider
user1: How about the other characters?
user2: The other characters are a shark hunter, the mayor, and the Scheider's wife and they all live in a town with a lot of beachgoers
user2: Sometimes the scariest parts don't even have the shark in them
user1: ok.
user1: So the movie is about scary sharks. what makes it scarier without sharks?
user2: For example, in one of the scenes you watch from the swimmer's perspective. One of the shark's victims is in the ocean and you see her disappear under the water, then later they find her body parts.
user1: Omg... that is horrible. How many people died from a shark's death?
user2: I'm not sure, but I know the police chief tried to get them to close the beaches, but the mayor wouldn't let them because he didn't want to lose the tourist money.
user1: That's not right at all. Only one shark attacked people or multiple ones?
user2: It was just one shark but they had to pay a shark hunter $10K to kill it, and on top of that there were a bunch of amateurs trying to hunt the shark, too.
user1: I bet the shark put up a good fight with the hunter.
user2: They caught a tiger shark at first, thinking it was the shark that was killing people, but they were wrong so the hunt kept going.
user1: So when did they realize the shark was the actual one doing the killing? They found a  body part on it or something?
user2: Well, they didn't find any body parts in the tiger shark, so that was clue one. Then when out looking they found a huge shark tooth stuck in sinking boat.
user2: Which made them think it was a giant great white, so they kept looking
user1: Interesting. this is really  a violent movie
user2: Yeah, you should see when they finally kill the shark. The hunter goes down underwater in one of those cages, but the shark is so big it destroys it and eats the shark hunter. 
user2: Luckily, the police chief manages to blow it up by feeding it a scuba tank and then shooting it
user1: Wow! Poor shark hunter. It's good they finally got rid of it before it killed more people.
user2: Yeah, and I'm glad the police chief survived, as I liked his character. His son witnesses one of the attacks, though, and it freaks him out, so it got very personal for him.
user1: I'm happy the main character made it at least.
user2: Yep. A lot of it could have been avoided if the dumb mayor had just shut the beaches down in the first place, though.
user1: Yeah .. a lot of deaths could've been avoided.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello
user2: You should see Jaws
user1: The movie I  choose was Jaws. 
user1: I have watched this movie numerous times, and loved it.
user2: It is great, it has suspense and a few laughs along the way to round it out
user2: Do you like thrillers?
user1: Exactly but the horror behind never knowing where the shark will attack was exciting.
user1: I love thrillers they keep me awake.
user1: What did you like most about the movie?
user2: I like the high energy and suspense, it is exhilarating 
user1: What part of the movie Jaws were you able to laugh? I laugh because the shark as so smart.
user2: You are right, not knowing where the next attack would be was the most fun part of the movie.
user1: I definitely agree it’s definalty high suspense.
user1: Also the people  in the movie were so casual not really aware.
user2: I laughed at the part when he said we're gonna need a bigger boat.

conversation:
user2: Jaws was a great thriller film by Steven Spielberg.
user1: Yes! It has a very high rotten tomatoes rating, and the average rating is excellent too. What do you think about the cast?
user2: They say it is "a sensationally effective action picture." And I agree. It is very good.
user2: The cast was good. I liked Roy Schneider as Chief Martin Brody.
user1: It is definitely an effective action picture. I like that it is both scary and dramatic.
user2: Lorraine Gary was decent as Ellen Brody.
user2: They were correct when they said it is a "scare machine".
user1: I think Richard Dreyfuss was great too. What about Spielberg? The critical responses show what a great director he is.
user2: Yes he is very good. I am glad he made this wonderful thriller film.
user2: It got a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes which is a score I agree with.
user1: I did not know the town was fictional, but I could tell it was obviously set in New England.
user2: Yes Amity Island sounds like a real place.
user2: I like New England and they captured it well.
user1: I thought they did too! I also appreciate that it is adapted from a Peter Benchley novel.
user2: They said it has more zest than a Woody Allen picture. That is a good way to put it.
user2: I liked the beach party scene in the beginning. 
user2: Remember when they closed the beaches? That was a good choice.
user1: Me too! That is one of the best scenes for sure. I also like the part where Quint shows up!
user2: I can't believe Quint offered his services for $10000. That was a lot of money back then.
user1: Yes! Of course, the mayor did not want them to close the beaches...
user2: Good thing oceanographer Matt Hooper was there to confirm the death was a shark attack.
user1: That was deifnitely a lot for back then. Yes, Hooper was like the expert?!
user2: Yeah. Remember when the local fisherman tried to catch a large tiger shark?
user2: I can't believe they declared the beach safe. Even after Hooper disputed that.
user1: So, they thought a tiger shark did that?
user2: I guess so.
user2: Then Hooper got that big great white shark's tooth.
user1: I guess when they found the sharks tooth they knew it was a different shark.
user2: Yes that is very true good point.
user1: Oh! I forgot about Brody's son on the boat!
user2: Yeah. Then they got on Orca to hunt the shark.
user1: The scene where the shark attacks the boat is awesome!
user2: Quint tried to hook the shark.
user2: Yeah finally they shoot the tank and kill the shark. Good thing they did that.
user1: Yes! Quint dies- the shark eats him
user2: Too bad for him. Unlike him I am still alive.
user2: At least Hooper and Brody survived.
user1: I did not mean that yes! like that lol- sad when he dies!!
user1: I love the part where they swim back

conversation:
user1: Jaws is a thriller movie, it is rather scary. Woody Allen is one of the actors. It involves a giant man-eating white shark that attack beach goers.  
user1: I would encourage you to watch the movie
user1: Jaws is presumed gruesome for children.
user1: Jaws is a fictional movie and I greatly recommend it
user1: The movie seems like a frightening experience
user1: The beach goers were on a remote island named Amity Island
user1: A lot of electricity was involved in the movie
user2: it is a good movie i did enjoyed 
user1: Jaws can give you an upset stomach if you are not strong when watching it
user1: Oh yes I loved watching it
user1: I plan to watch it again
user2: yes i feel it
user1: I wish I was one of the actors in the movie
user2: oh great
user1: Jaws was directed by Steven Spielberg
user2: yes he is great directer
user1: Oh yes. What part of the movie you like the most?
user2: i like all part of the movie especially the climax
user1: thats awesome 
user2: the white shark is looking very realistic and terrible
user1: very scary and looks real mean
user2: yes yes
user1: I love thriller movies

conversation:
user2: Hi how many times have you seen Jaws, I cringe when I hear the music because my husband watches it whenever it come on
user1: I have seen Jaws about tens times. I originally saw it as a child in the movie theater. I was the scariest movie ever!
user2: I never thought it was scary. I love the water and after we saw jaws when I was a little kid I had to look up the stats about shark attacks. I did like Richard Dreyfuss in this movie though.
user1: Wow. I did not go into the ocean for a long time. Maybe because I lived in Rhode Island. I thought the Richard Dreyfus character was awesome. Very different from the book but he was great.My fav character though was Quint. He was the best. 
user2: I liked Quinn too, but what really bothered me about this movie was that theu were concerned with shark attacks but did nothing to keep the tourists out of the water.
user1: The attach scenes were a little too gruesome. I remember my father had to take my little brother out of the movie but I stayed with my mother. I think that was the first movie I saw that made me scared in real life too. I don't even think I saw what the shark looked like until I watched the movie on TV. My eye were closed most of the time.
user2: Aw that's cute. The scenes were scary as kids, but watching it now and comparing it to some of the horror movies today makes kids say that was scary? 
user1: I remember watching it with my young daughter and her friend at the time on TV one afternoon and they were making fun of me because I was telling them to hide their eyes. They laughed at me and said it was so fake. They grew up with Discovery Channel and Shark Week. lol
user2: I know, children are so jaded lately.  Iaughed at the description where they said it was too gruesome for children. I think it was R rated when it came out.
user1: I am not sure what is was rated but my parents took me. Must have been the popularity at the time. I remember everyone screaming not just the kids. Lots of people walked out.  Too bad we are so used to violence and gore now.
user2: Yeah, that was not a movie my parents would have taken me to see because the content would have scared the snot out of my little brother
user1: I know. The first scene with the girl swimming at night and getting dragged under. Even at 12, I remember thinking that was dumb to go in the water alone at night. 
user2:  i think we are at the end of conversation?
user1: Not sure. How to we know? I thought there were four docs to comment on. 
user1: You do not see the docs do you?
user2: Yes That's what they said but also  said 4 turns, they did nt change doc
user1: My docs are changing. I thought it said twelve turn. Oh well. Guess it was not clear. They are not talking about the prank with the little boys and cardboard fin,
user2: I still am on jaws nothing changing, just went back to turk and it does say 12x. but I am about talked out about Jaws.
user1: It is hard to notice. Look under key scenes. 
user1: Do you remember the scene with the fake fin?
user1: Do you remember the scene with the dismembered leg? Gross! lol
user1: Do give up we can do this! lol
user1: Are you giving up? lol. Just follow my lead.
user1: My partner abandoned the conversation. I have been doing this hit for 30 mins. Please pay me lol 

conversation:
user2: First off, i have never seen this movie
user2: so bear with me
user2: It appears we are talking about jaws today
user1: Its ok. Yes we are talking about Jaws.
user2: its stars roy cheider and the cheif martin brody
user1: YEs and Steven Spielberg is the director
user1: What's the Genre?

conversation:
user2: Hi, do you normally watch thrillers?
user1: I do sometimes, as long as they aren't totally gratuitously gory. 
user1: i like suspense-y ones
user2: You should watch Jaws if you like older movies that are suspensful.
user1: Oh I think I have seen Jaws like a million times since I was a kid. ha
user2: Same here.
user1: Aren't there like a few different ones?
user1: i always seem to just watch the originals
user2: I think so but the original is where it's at. I've seen a few of the sequels and they were pretty bad
user1: yesss. usually are and then I get all pissy about it. 
user2: They say the original Jaws was a "scare machine that works with computer-like precision".
user1: hmm. interesting. 
user2: Who could ask for anything more?
user1: yeah i guess! and i mean I guess it was pretty scary, esp for the time. 
user2: I think it is funny when they catch the small tiger shark and the Mayor is all its safe now. Nope
user1: that would be too easy
user2: It really was well done. And the soundtrack.
user1: I'll have to look that up because I honestly don't even remember the music at this point aside from the shark suspense sound. ha
user2: Yes that's what I am talking about but I'm sure the whole score is great. I'm pretty sure John Williams did it.
user1: i'm so bad with names but yeah, will have to listen later
user2: How they kill Jaws in the end with the propane tank was savage.
user1: for sure. buh bye sharky
user2: I guess it was a scuba tank but 
user1: i'm so foggy on details to be honest
user1: i don't think I've actually watched it in a decade or so
user2: Well I won't spoil any more. You should give it a rewatch. I watched it within the past few years with my teenagers. It holds up
user1: i tried to watch with mine and they couldn't care less. 
user2: Mine are usually the same, but the good ones usually suck them in.
user1: I tried to get mine to watch ET and Gremlins. Nope. 
user1: But they will watch Harry and the Hendersons. yessss
user2: Alright, have a good one hope you watch and enjoy Jaws. Oh my Gremlins is a good one and Harry & the Hendersons is one of my favorites! Nice chatting with you.
user1: same here!

user1: The movie is Jaws. It's a very good movie.
user2: Yes i have watched this movie many times
user1: Do you like Steven Spielberg movies?
user2: Yes i do
user1: Did you know Jaws was based on a novel by Peter Benchley? 
user2: And i like to watch thrillers 
user1: I see I see. 
user2: No i don't know about that
user1: It's hard to believe Jaws was released in 1975.
user2: Yes i guess there is sequence for this
user1: What do you enjoy about thrillers?
user2: Scary part
user1: I see. Jaws is definitely scary according to critics. 
user2: Yes rating was also too good
user1: Yeah the ratings are very high in IMDB and Metacritics.
user2: And of course director was very talented to make a movie like this in1975
user1: Are you familiar with the actors of the cast such as Roy Schneider and Robert Shaw?
user1: Yeah Spielberg is very talented.
user2: No i'm not familiar.I got to know about them after watching the movie
user1: If a shark were to eat a person in real life like in this movie I wonder if it would start a shark hunting frenzy as well.
user2: yes all the shark scenes are amazing to watch
user1: I wasn't aware professional shark hunters like Quint existed. $10,000 seems like good money.
user2: Haha that's right
user2: By the way nice talking to you
user1: Yes likewise
user1: Hmm Orca seems like an interesting name for a shark hunters boat.
user2: Ya and the response for this movie was great
user1: How many people has this shark eaten?! Yes the plot seems like it would really create a good response.
user2: I guess many people was killed by the shark
user1: Yeah

conversation:
user1: Hi!  Have you had a chance to learn about the movie?
user2: hey have you seen jaws??
user1: Actually, I haven't, if you can believe that.
user1: Would you recommend it?
user2: oh my!! its an absolute classic thriller from the 70's , with spielberg as the director!
user1: Spielberg is great.  Which actors are in it?
user2: it is based on peter benchleys 1974 novel of the same name
user2: roy scheider , robert shaw , lorraine gary , richard dreyfuss
user1: Do you think the movie is as good as the book?
user2: i reckon so, rotten tomatoes has it rated 97% and imdb with a rating of 8/10
user1: That's a really good rating.  Do you know where it's set?
user2: the movie is set on the coast of massachusets on an island called amity
user2: would you like to hear some of the critical responses from the movie?
user1: Yes, please!
user2: some critics have said it is a scare machine that works with computer like precision .............. you feel like a rat being given shock therapy!!
user1: Hmmm...not sure how I feel about that.  Any others?
user2: others have said a sensationally effective action picture , a scary thriller that works all the better because its populated with characters that have been developed into human beings
user2: how do you feel about that?
user1: That sounds a little better.  What else can you tell me about the movie that might help me decide whether or not to watch it?
user2: well there is alot of a suspense in this movie , as they believe that a killer shark is around , and they decide to hold a shark hunting event 
user2: so you can imagine the drama and action that comes with such a storyline
user1: Do you think it would be a good movie to watch for a date night?
user2: of course it would
user2: your date would get scared and jump at all the thriller scenes , good excuse to have her cuddle up next to you
user1: Are the main characters likeable and interesting?
user2: Robert Shaw is absolutely magnificent as a coarse fisherman finally hired to locate the Great White Shark; and Richard Dreyfuss, in another excellent characterization as a likeable young scientist
user1: I'm not familiar with Robert Shaw.  What other movies has he been in?
user2: from russia with love and the sting
user2: this movie is generally a big hit with everyone
user1: Are there a lot of special effects in the movie?
user2: As Pat Jankiewicz, author of the Jaws compendium Just When You Thought It Was Safe, says, “The animatronic shark in Jaws showed how effective an animatronic special effect could be. While the stories of it malfunctioning are legendary, it is completely believable and terrifying onscreen. The climax, where the shark and Roy Schieder battle to the death, is utterly dependent on the creature's effectiveness and it delivers. While Steven Spielberg hid the shark until the climax, Bob Mattey's monster lives up to the film's build up by being as scary as we were told it would be up to that point.”
user1: Sounds good so far!  Is it available on Netflix?
user2: im not so sure if its availible to stream off netflix :(
user1: Maybe I can catch it somewhere else.  What year was it made again?
user2: the movie was made in 1975
user1: Thanks!  I appreciate all your help, maybe I'll go check it out some time.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hey
user2: you know jaws, right?
user1: Yes, such a classic thriller movie
user2: And how about Richard Dreyfuss as matt hooper
user1: Yes, each character is great.
user1: I hated the mayor, trying to keep the beaches open just to make money though
user2: and bieng released in 1075, I feel so old!
user2: some critics would have found it funny in a woody allen kind of way
user1: I saw if much after it's original release, but one of Spielbergs great movies
user2: that beach party that takes place at dusk is quite a scene
user1: Yeah, I always wanted to leave near a beach to visit often, but unfortunetly I do not, only visit the shore during the summer
user1: *live
user2: Well, if you had a police chief like Brody Martin, he coould attempt to close the beaches to keep everyone safe
user1: This movie was a huge success, but made tons of bad choices trying to do sequels of this film.
user2: yes, they should have stuck closer to peter benchly's original novel
user2: Robert Shaw as the shark bounty hunter Quint is a terrific character
user1: Nothing beats a grumbling sea captain
user1: Always singing sea songs and drinking with the Police chief
user2: And the shark itself. I would describe it a s a sizable great white
user1: Yeah, the newer "Thriller" shark movie, The Shallows is a great modern shark movie
user2: well I wouldn't call it a scare machine that works like computer like precision, like some critics
user1: For it's time it was scary, and one of a kind. Nothing beats the classics
user2: well it's because, as some critics say, [speilberg] really knows how to tell a story onscreen
user1: He does, with Indiana Jones, Saving Private Ryan and numerous other that followed, he is a great director.
user2: Probably why aggregate sits like Rotten Tomatos give it 97 percent score
user1: Very True
user2: that scene at the end where Brody shoots a pressurized tank in the shark's mouth is a key scene in my opinion

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hi! Have you  seen the movie Jaws? Its a thriller
user2: of course, awesome movie
user2: Robert Shaw is incredible
user1: Of course Jaws is not a children's movie because it can be grewsome.
user2: how did you like it, yes it can be very gruesome
user1: Robert Shaw plays Quint the shark hunter
user2: I love the cast, great actors
user2: too bad the shark was so fussy lol
user1: Rotten Tomatoes only gives the score of 2/10 but IMDB gives a rating of 8/10
user2: what do they know, though I didn't like the other Jaws movies
user2: IMDB is a fan based rating
user2: its a classic film
user1: Do you feel sympathy for the attack victims or do you feel like they are just a small part of the story?
user2: good point, of course I feel bad for them but you bring up a good point, as they are integral  to the story
user1: The first scene of the movie is pretty interesting for sure.
user2: some one HAS to get eaten for the plot to work
user1: good point!
user2: yes very much so, good opening
user2: I love how the characters develop
user2: "we need a bigger boat" fabulous line
user1: It is interesting that they put a bounty out on the shark, funny to think of an animal  with a bounty
user2: some times that happens, but they have to do something to bring in Shaw's character
user2: even some bears get bounty's when they have harmed people
user1: I think it would be hard to return to the beach even if someone declares it safe
user2: no kidding, I wouldn't go there LOL
user2: the last scene is intense
user2: good finale
user1: tell me about the final scene
user2: where the sheriffs character is on the sinking boat and has the rifle aimed at the air tank in the sharks mouth
user1: Spielberg sure knows how to tell a story
user2: he did a great job with this movie
user2: great director
user2: this is one of those films you have to see again and again
user1: Paddling back to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage after the explosion is epic. 
user2: that was a great ending
user2: I liked Dreyfus' character
user1: Someone says the movie makes you feel lie a rat being given shock therapy, do you want to see it again and again?
user2: LOLOL that's good, only now and again, but its still a classic
user2: some classics never lose value
user1: I sure wouldn't want to examine a dead body for cause of death, he was a good actor making it realisitic
user2: neither would I, yes he is a very good actor
user2: I would watch it again if it came up on TV
user2: I dont own a copy of it
user1: I've only seen it one time believe it or not. I wonder if I would like it again or if it would be lame
user1: 1975 was a long time ago
user2: well yeah, older movie
user2: but still worth a watch
user1: I wonder if sharks can really destroy cages as depicted in the movie
user2: its still a classic thriller
user1: I guess the explosion is more epic
user2: I dont think so
user2: better way to end it
user2: sharks are strong but not that strong
user1: Quints boat name makes me happy, I don't know why but I have positive associations with ORCA
user2: its a cool name for a boat
user1: Poor vacationers on fourth of July weekend!
user2: he character is incredible
user2: no kidding LOL
user2: thanks for chatting
user1: thanks for chatting too!

conversation:
user2: When I see that Jaws came out in 1975 it feels so long ago.
user1: Hello?
user1: Hello?
user2: HI
user2: I forgot that it was to take place in New England

conversation:
user2: Hi are you ready to start
user1: I am. Are you?
user2: Yes
user2: You can start if you don't mind
user1: Do you like Thriller Movies
user2: Yes! I love them! I try not to watch them alone. What are your thoughts on Jaws?
user1: I enjoyed it. I think that the rating is a little high though. What do you think?
user2: I thought the rating was above average for this movie. The shark image looked animated to me. I guess it was the year it was put out. 
user2: However I will no be getting in the ocean because I am deathly afraid of sharks.
user1: that's what I was thinking too. One of the responses says "likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable" I guess comparing it to movies now that is crazy, but at that time that was cutting edge
user1: I don't get deep in the ocean, just up to my thighs.
user2: Yes, scared me into not wanting to get in the ocean or on a boat.  I do agree thats its gruesome for children.
user2: Jaws was a movie I grew up with. Probably the first horror film I watched. 
user1: Jaws was the first movie that my parents went and saw as a date. My dad wanted to see a thriller to have my mom scared
user2: This movie was also a recipient of an Academy Award. Goes to show how much movies have changed over time. 
user2: I bet she wasn't thrilled about that. Lol
user1: I didn't know that. Movies have changed, that is for sure.
user2:  I bet if they did a newly remake the movie would be awesome. I love watching shark movies and I'm a fan of shark week. Just not a fan of the ocean. That's their turf. 
user2: What did you think of the actors and the performance?
user1: I've always said they should remake it.
user1: I thought that Robert Shaw did a good job. 
user1: what did you think?
user2: Yes he played the part well I didn't care for his wife's acting in the movie
user2: It just seemed forced.
user2: And the music leading up to Jaws coming was always creepy to me. 
user1: Oh yeah, but it did the job. 35 years later and when people here that song they know what it means
user2: Yes they do. I actually heard someone have it as a ringtone on their cell phone. 
user1: What is your favorite scene from the movie?
user2: This movie did cause a stir when it came out. Alot of people were going out and killing great white sharks for the heck of it. 
user2: I would say when they enter the shark cage and he destroys the cage.
user1: That is a good part.
user2: I also like the explosion at the end. I was like thank goodness they can get back to land
user2: They were on some small boats to be messing with that big shark.
user2: And the shark showed up on the forth of July when the beaches were full and scared everyone away. 
user2: In all, I thought it was a good movie for its time. The suspense was there and also had a good storyline. 
user2: are you there
user2: Hello
user2: I can't finish without you

conversation:
user2: What's the movie called?
user1: JAWS is the title.
user1: It's a thriller from 1975.
user2: What's it about?
user1: It's about a shark that attacks people in New England. It's a classic horror film.
user2: Who directed it?
user1: The great Steven Spielberg.
user2: Anything interesting about it I should know?
user1: It's not a good film for kids thanks to the violence. It's also been hailed by critics as a great horror thriller.
user2: Must be rated R then, huh?
user1: It's about shark bounty hunting, which I think is cool. I don't know the rating.
user2: Do you know how long it is?
user1: Nope, but it's based on a novel, so I'd say it's longer than your average film.
user1: Just a guess, though.
user2: who stars in it
user1: Some great actors. Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Lorraine Gary.
user1: Do you know anything about it?
user2: Do you know if it was filmed on location or on a studio set?
user1: I don't know that.
user2: Who did the cinematography?
user1: Spielberg directed it. I don't know if that makes him the cinematographer or not.
user2: I guess he could be.
user2: Anything else to say about the movie?
user1: It has some interesting scenes, but I don't want to spoil it.
user2: Thanks that wouldn't be good.
user1: You're welcome. Anything else you wanna know?
user2: Nope that's it. Thanks.

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: hello
user1: Have you seen the movie Jaws?
user2: As a whole, no. I've seen bits and pieces over the years.
user2: and you?
user2: My husband watched it a couple of weeks ago so it hasn't been that long
user1: Yes, I've watched it several times. Still one of the most thrilling pictures I've ever watched.
user2: You think so? It's a classic Spielberg movie. Everything he touches turns to gold
user1: Yes I admire his directing abilities. In Jaws he made the shark the central character and brought some depth to it. 
user2: I agree
user1: Just hearing the music sends shivers through you.
user2: I think he also enlightened many with his use of animatronics and special effects. We've come a long way since then
user2: I think it was Jaws that was the first of its type
user2: music: I feel that way with The Exorcist
user1: Yes. The exorcist sacred the bejesus out of me. With Jaws I avoided mud puddles for months.
user2: mud puddles? lol. You must have been tiny when it came out
user1: No. I was in my thirties, just a scaredy cat.
user2: lol, that's funny. 
user2: Jaws is definitely a classic. 
user2: And Steven Spielberg is a master at his craft
user1: Yes, but as you said, by today's standards it is passe.
user2: So true. When my husband watched it a couple of weeks ago, my 3 yr old looked up and instead of being afraid he asked to go to the beach and my 1 year old started singing a song called "baby shark"
user2: I wasn't allowed to watch the movie until I was about 12 yrs old
user1: No respect for the classics! For me the most starling scene was when the severed head rolled out of the submerged boat that he was investigating.
user2: ha ha he. I enjoyed that scene
user1: Made me spill my popcorn all over the floor.
user2: that made me laugh out loud. Thank you
user1: It was one of the very few movies that I watched in a theater 
user2: I know the movie scared many people away from the water and gave many altered view of sharks and their nature
user1: Yes. The author of the book Benchley regretted the fact that so many people began killing sharks after that. 
user2: That's a shame. It was sensationalized. It's a movie. It's supposed to fabricate the truth for entertainment
user1: Do you normally watch scary movies?
user2: Yeah, somewhat. I prefer supernatural thrillers if I'm looking for a horror genre film
user2: Do you?
user1: yes, but we better stick to Jaws or we'll be here forever. Not that I'm not enjoying our chat.
user2: I agree. I'm going to finish the conversation. Have a wonderful day and a relaxing weekend!

conversation:
user1: hey there
user2: Hello!
user1: how are you doing?
user2: I'm well and you?
user1: im doing fine
user2: Have you seen the movie "Jaws"?
user1: no i have not
user1: what is it about?
user2: Directed by Steven Spielberg?
user2: It's an American thriller film.
user1: who is starring in the movie
user2: It is a story about a white shark who begins attacking beach-goers
user2: Roy Sheider and Robert Shaw star in the film.
user1: how long is the movie
user2: I'm not sure, but I do know that it came out in 1975
user2: Do you know about the ratings of the movie?
user1: no i do not know that
user2: It actually did really well. It scored an average of about 8.5 out of 10.
user2: Have you heard of the rating site Rotten Tomatoes?
user1: yes i have heard of it. 
user1: i go on it a lot to check reviews
user2: It's great, right?
user2: For this film, Rotten Tomatoes gave a 97% rating.
user1: did it win any awards?
user2: Not that I know of, but I'm sure it was at least nominated.
user2: The problem at the time was that many thought it was too gruesome for children to watch.
user1: ah okay
user1: that makes sense
user2: Do you know what another criticism was?
user1: it was rated r?
user1: what was it?
user2: That it made it difficult for anyone to have sympathy for the shark's victims.
user2: I'm not sure what it was rated.
user2: Do you know what the name of the boat in the movie was?
user1: that is strange 
user1: what was the name of it
user2: The Orca.
user2: Thank you for chatting with me!
user1: thats cool

conversation:
user2: Jaws is one of my favorite Steven spielberg movies
user1: I love Jaws!
user1: i didnt realize it was that old, wow 1975!
user2: Same Here! Im afraid of oceans because of Jaws. Wow 1975! classic movie for its age How did you like martin brodys acting?
user1: I honestly had no idea who Martin Broody was...
user2: same before this movie. Jaws was also rated 9.2/10 thats really well
user1: I cant believe how high of a rating Rotten Tomatoes gave Jaws.  9.2/10.  That is such a high rating.
user1: Did you know about the novel before watching Jaws for the first time?
user2: yeah! thought it was a based on a real incident somewhere in the world but clearly states it was "fictional" thank god!
user2: They have a novel? no way! i didn't know that. 
user1: yes the novel was also called Jaws and was wrote in 1974.
user2: wow throwback to 1970's! wow the local shark hunter only charged 10,000$ to find and kill the man eating shark
user1: wow 10,000 in the 70's would have been a pretty good sized amount of money.
user2: but to risk your life for that type of money. I don't think worth it. 
user1: Its all in the eyes of the beholder i suppose.
user2: true!  feel bad for chrissie watkins trying to just have fun and skinny dip but to be eaten alive by a shark!
user1: yeah being eatin alive would be a most horrid experience for anyone...
user2: can't believe the mayor said the beach was safe after they caught a tiger shark.. little did he know
user1: yeah little did they know...
user1: I can see how they would mistake a tiger shark for that of Jaws though, as they are pretty large sharks.
user1: To call the beaches safe was absurd!
user2: yeah good point. the mayor also knew forth of july was around the corner and didn't want to close the beach down for it. kinda his fault.
user1: I bet finding that partial corpse was disturbing
user2: yeah! it would send me to shock too like it did brody's son
user1: I didnt know the boat was named The Orca!  So cool.
user2: makes sense to send a boat named after a killer whale to kill a beast of a shark. crazy quint saw that shark and wasn't afraid of it.
user1: I would not even enter the water in a titanium shark proof cage!  They must be braver than I!
user2: when hooper put on the scuba gear and went in to the water i thought he was for sure dead
user2: yea titanium couldn't even hold jaws back he broke right through the cage
user1: ouch, to say the least.  Those cages are suppose to be very safe...
user2: yeah my favorite part was when jaws exploded! 
user2: Well cya later 
user1: Oh yeah Jaws exploding was awesome!  

conversation:
user2: Ok the movie is Jaws
user1: What is Jaws about?
user2: A giant man-eating shark attacks people on an island and has to be taken care of
user1: Oh. Do you know how they take care of it?
user2: I don't want to give away the ending but a piliceman, biologist, and a shark hunter go after it
user1: That sounds exciting.
user2: It is a very exciting movie and is highly rated
user1: What was the rating?
user2: Rotten tomatoes gives it a 97% and IMDB an 8/10
user1: Oh it must be a really good movie then.
user2: Any other questions I can answer?
user1: Do you know any of the cast?
user2: It features Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfus, and Lorraine Gary
user1: Which one is the main character?
user2: Roy Schneider plays Chief Martin Brody
user1: Oh okay. Do you know what island they are on?
user2: It is called Amity island. They are having a beach party there at the beginning of the movie
user1: Does the shark appear at the party?
user2: Yes, Jaws makes his first appearance when he attacks a woman in the water at the party
user1: Oh wow, did she die?
user2: Yes, some of her remains are found and that is when everyone realizes they have a problem
user1: That sounds horrifying for everyone involved.
user2: Yes, that's why a group of experts has to come together to find the shark
user1: What are the names of the other experts?
user2: Chief Martin Brody, Quint, Matt Hooper, and Ellen Brody
user1: So there's only one shark or multiple?
user2: One really big shark
user1: Still scary. Do you know what type of shark it is?
user2: It is a great white shark

conversation:
user1: I am looking for a good movie
user1: whatcha got?
user2: How about jaws? A scary Thriller
user1: hmm never seen it 
user1: whats it about 
user2: a giant man eating great white shark
user1: ew'
user1: sounds gross
user2: They have to hunt it down. Its a 70's movie
user1: why would I like that 
user1: ahhh
user1: sounds great!
user2: Good  you should see it
user1: thnks
user2: It may not be for the faint of heart but its really not bad
user2: your welcome
user2: A woman goes skinny dipping then disapears
user1: ooo nice
user2: people are trying to figure it out
user1: lol we done here
user2: turns out it was a shark attack
user2: dun dun
user2: idk  it says i have to keep writing  like at least 15 times
user2: then after a new paragraph shows
user1: haha 
user1: ok
user2: Stars roy schnieder
user1: well It sounds good you sold me 
user1: so lets just sit here? 
user2: it was also a novel
user2: gotta keep typing
user1: ever read time machine?
user1: he wells? 
user1: oh
user2: yass
user1: so good
user1: and invisible man 
user1: so gooood
user2: It twas not the tiger shark!
user2: yes that one is good
user1: done
user2: Do you like thrillers?

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: I love Jaws, was a real thriller. Right?
user2: I love Jaws too! The giant man-eating  white shark kept me away from going into the ocean for awhile.
user1: Me too! I haven't been back since. Must have been too gruesome for children.
user2: Yes definitely an action packed movie with lots of scares. I didn't even feel bad for the shark's victims. I mean I didn't want them to get eaten when I was scared, but part of me kind of wanted them to be eaten too!
user1: I thought my man Chief Martin Brody was sweet in it.
user1: I agree, a shark gots to eat too
user2: I think Robert Shaw was iconic in that movie as  the shark hunter.
user1: Although I wish there was more pie in it, I thought Spielberg did a good job Directing.
user2: He definitely made a great movie, like a Woody Allen movie but with more pizazz!
user1: Exactly! It got pretty good scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I bet it would have got a 99% if it had more pie.
user2: Metacritics socred it with an 87 which isn't bad at all. Maybe pie was the deciding factor.
user2: I thought it was totally believable that they would put a bounty on the shark after the second attack.
user1: I agree, after it ate that skinny dipper Chrisse Watkins. I bet to the shark, she tasted like pie.
user2: Must have been a low sugar no carb pie because he went after the second person soon after. Weird how they waited for the second attack to rule it was a shark doing it.
user1: Yeah, they probably thought the bite mark looked like a propeller wound. 
user2: I didn't like the Mayor very much. I know he was worried about the town's economy but he definitely was quick to throw the people's safety in the water.
user1: Yeah I didn't the Mayor much either. Would you have joined the armature shark hunt frenzy? if instead of $10,000, you got 10,000 pies as the prize for winning?
user2: I probably would've still went for the money, though I don't know if the Mayor would've let me charge them $10,000 seeing as I am no professional shark hunter like Quint. You?
user1: Yeah, I so would have. But I would have sold all the pies but one, and triple my profit.
user2: That's how you do it. I knew when they caught that tiger shark it wasn't the right shark. I was so mad at Mayor Larry for opening the beach back up without fully investigating it.
user1: Yes very irresponsible! How could you tell? are you a shark expert?  
user2: That tiger shark was way too small! Poor Chrissie couldn't have been taken out by one of those! When they found the shark tooth in the submerged hull, I knew it was something way bigger. I am not a professional shark expert, but I do like sharks.
user1: Well nice use of logic! I agree, they should have know by the size of the bite mark.
user2: I loved the name of Quint's boat, the Orca.
user1: Me too, those are my favorite scenes in the movie!
user1: How do you feel about the ending?
user2: I thought the ending was great! I was on the edge of my seat when the shark destroyed the cage before Hooper could inject it with the hypodermic spear.
user2: What did you think?
user1: It was so intense! I felt a large sense of panic when the boat was sinking.
user2: I thought it was so smart to put the pressurized scuba tank in the shark's mouth. I would've never thought of that in the moment.
user1: It was genius. Quint's rifle really came in handy!
user2: I definitely thought the boat was going to sink before Brody could shoot the scuba tank!
user1: Well, I'm going to get going, the pies are almost done. Remember, look out for fins when on the beach!
user2: Ok will do! I hope you enjoy those pies!

user2: Hi there, happy Valentines day. What movie should I be watching tonight?

user1: Gosh, i think actors that we don't know bc heck it was the late 70s lol
user1: I do know of steven spielberg tho lol
user2: He directed it?
user1: there were remakes of this movie and those were not good
user1: yes, he did 
user1: and the theme music for when the shark comes out is pretty catchy. once you hear it once, you will never forget it. 
user2: DO you know if it has won any kond of award?
user2: I do know of the theme song
user1: I actually do not know if it did win any- but i would be shocked if it did not
user1: this document they show us does not specify awards that i see
user2: How about the actual plot
user2: like why should I see this moive
user1: it starts with fishermen "finding" the shark because they are attacked- and most of the movie is on the beach
user1: and the attacks are very gory!
user1: there is a shark hunter in the movie too
user1: the beach owner refuses to close the beaches. its pretty intense movie. I should watch it again I would call this a classic
user2: oh that sounds alittle interesting
user2: what kind of ratings does it have from the critics
user2: do people love it?
user1: Not bad ratings. Rotten tomatoes gives 97, metacritics 87 and imdb 8/10
user2: not bad
user1: i'm a bit sad that the score is a bit low on the last 2.
user2: did you like those better?
user1: oh i forgot richard dreyfuss is in this movie. probably the only name that i really know
user2: oh woow love him
user1: no, they are pretty much all the same to me.  rotten tomatoes usually is a bit more harsh i feel like- so it's a bit weird that they have the highest score.
user2: thats pretty cool
user2: i think i will see it
user2: imm be looking to rent it from where

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hello

user1: good
user1: interesting
user2: one of the best Action movie 
user2: what is the favorite prat you like most
user1: the action and the plot

user1: they are those movies that always fill me with suspense
user1: and the characters act very well
user2: yes all character were strong and the action song annimation perfect
user1: yes
user1: It is very scary
user2: yes scary but kind of danger is it in right?

user2: no no?
user2: i just saw and rates the emotions of the people
user1: and it also gives me nightmares when I see that movie
user2: nightmare? what kind?
user1: that a shark follows me

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hey! you should watch this awesome movie
user2: Which movie is it?
user1: its called Jaws
user2: Oh i have heard of that one, it looks really good
user1: it came out in 1975
user2: Way before i was born. It is definitely a classic
user1: it has a 97% rotten tomatoes score, and a 87/100 metacritic score
user2: Those are great scores, Everyone must really love that movie
user1: yeah! it was directed by steven speilberg, based on a novel of the same name
user2: I have not read the novel either.  I do love Steven Speilberg 
user2: Is it a kid friendly movie?
user1: One of the key scenes involves a woman, Chrissie Watkins, being killed in a shark attack. Fearing the worse, police chief closes the beaches. But fearing loss of income, the mayor reopens the beaches. Another attack occurs causing a shark hunting frenzy. not good for children!
user1: one review states "jaws is too gruesome for children" specifically
user2: Yeah that defintely sounds to gruesome for children to see 
user1: the performance from roy schnieder as the police chief was exceptional 
user2: I dont think i have seen any movies with him in it. I am so interested to watch this movie
user1: what genres of movies do you typically watch?
user2: More romance or drama type movies.  I dont normally see the gruesome kind but I do occasionaly watch them if they are really good 
user2: Horror movies are fun to sometimes
user1: my favorite part is when the shark enters tourist infested waters during fourth of july weekend
user1: i thought it was really exciting
user2: I bet that is exciting. Fourth of july is a very busy time at the beeach so prolly thousands of people around then 
user1: yeah! when you watch make sure to pay attention to the scene afterwards when they set out on their boat to try and catch to shark. the mayor stuffs an entire scuba tank in its mouth
user2: Wow an entire scuba tank? thats impressive
user1: afterwards he climbs on his boat and shoots the tank, exploding the shark
user2: WOW that seems so cool. I really want to see this movie now 
user1: you should! robert shaw plays the mayor and hes great
user2: I am going to try and rent it or see if its on netflix or somewhere 
user1: do you normally watch movies with high reviews?
user2: yes i do, i love movies that have great reviews

conversation:
user1: Hello?
user2: Hi
user2: Have you ever seen the movie Jaws?
user1: No, what is it about?
user2: It is a horror/thriller. It came out back in 1975. It's about a shark that eats people when they go to the beach and get in the water.
user1: Wow. I've probably heard some references to this before but that sounds interesting. Who directed it again?
user2: The great Steven Spielberg!
user1: I definitely need to see it. Who else was in it?
user2: Yes, you should definitely see it. I saw it as a kid and was really scared. Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Lorraine Gary all starred in it.
user1: The ocean's predators are rather scary. I'm not sure if I should see it though, will it make me afraid of the ocean?
user2: Lol, it probably will for a while. The teens in the movie had a beach party and that's when they started getting attacked. So I guess if you stay way from beach parties, you should be fine.
user1: The shark only goes after party people? That is kind of funny. What else happens in the movie?
user2: The main character, named Chrissie, was at the party. She went skinny dipping in the ocean and was pulled under the water. The next day, her remains washed ashore. 
user1: RIP Chrissie. So it goes after a lot of people I take it...
user2: Whoever goes in to the water gets attacked. In this case since it was a bunch of teens at the beach, they were the victims. 
user1: So who goes after the shark? Some teens?
user2: After Chrissie's remains were found, the Mayor of the town didn't want tourists to get scared. He thought it would mess up the city's economy for the summer. So he had authorities say Chrissie was in a boating accident. Then a bounty was placed on the shark to try and find it.
user1: A bounty? That's pretty cool. Who is the shark bounty hunters?
user2: It was a group of local shark hunters.
user1: That's crazy. So there's a lot of action in the movie?
user2: Total action thriller. it was also based on a novel written by Peter Benchley.
user1: Cool. I think I should see it some time. Any other interesting facts?
user2: It was definitely a hit movie back in the day. I received 9.2 out of 10 stars from Rotten Tomatoes. There are also numerous sequels to the movie that came out over the years.
user1: Oh maybe I can watch the whole series then. You seem to know a lot about Jaws, anything else?
user2: It was called ""the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made" by critics. 
user2: Better than a Woody Allen movie
user1: That's a cool line.
user2: I thought so too.
user2: However, it is also considered "too gruesome for children.
user1: Was it set in the same time period as it was released in?
user1: I bet kids were quite scared of it.
user2: Yes it was. You can definitely tell it's the 70's when you watch it.
user1: That must have made people more scared.
user2: It did indeed.
user1: Well I believe it's time to go, thanks for the info

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user2: I have recently watched a spectacle from Steven Spielberg called JAWS. Its awesome
user1: Yes, I agree
user2: Have you watched it before? Its a classic
user2: Roy Schneider in the lead well supported by Robert Shaw and Lorraine Gary.
user2: Are you there bro?
user1: Hello
user2: Hi there
user1: This film is excellent
user2: It's a 1975 movie inspired from a book with the same name
user2: Have you watched the movie?
user1: scare machine that works with computer-like precision
user1: Yes I have
user2: Yeah, I agree.
user2: An awesome thriller to come up in that generation time,,, too ahead of its time.
user1: It was made in 1975
user2: A beach party where it all starts to happen and the beach closes.
user2: And the local politics..
user1: a while back back
user2: Rotten tomatoes has given it an average of 9.2/10 n imdb 8/10. Good reviews
user2: After the incident yet the Mayor keeps the beach open... that ads to the twist of the movie.
user2: I loved the movie fully. One of the best thriller classic.
user2: Are you there bro?
user1: I am here
user2: Critical Responses are always scary

user2: The key scenes description here are very very large. lol 
user2: The climax was awesome.
user1: yes
user1: scary
user2: Putting the pressurised scuba  tank into the shark's mouth and then shooting it.
user1: Brody was great
user2: Finish was as well far ahead of its time..

user1: Okay so we have covered everything that the task ask for
user2: Okay man nice to text you
user1: same to you
user1: thank you
user2: Bye
user1: bye

conversation:
user1: Hi.  My name is Sandy.
user2: Hi Sandy, I'm Ashley 
user2: If you haven't seen Jaws yet, you need to! Such a great movie. A classic!
user1: Oh, yes!  It's one of my favorites.  I actually have the DVD.
user1: Do you have any favorite parts in that movie?
user2: I can't believe it's been over 40 years ago since it was released (1975). 
user1: Yeah...makes me feel really old.  lol
user2: It's hard to pick just one favorite!... I know! 
user2: I still don't like swimming in the ocean because of Jaws. 
user1: I watched it on the big screen when it first came out.  I was 13 years old at the time.  Scared me so much, I didn't even want to take a bath for a couple of months.  :D
user2: I didn't realize that it was actually based off a book. Stephen Spielberg did such a great job directing. 
user1: Yes.  I had read the book first, so sort of knew what to expect.  
user2: I need to watch it again, my kids are a little young to see it though, since it's so gruesome. 
user1: Richard Dryfuss was exceptional in that movie.  He added the right amount of humor to it.
user2: Lorraine Gary fit the character of Ellen Brody so well. 
user1: Yes, she did.  When I watch it these days, I kinda have to laugh because the shark looks so robotic.  Can you imagine if they made the original today with how far they've come in movie making.  It would look so real! 
user2: It really would be a great movie to be remade. But then again, it would be hard to beat the first. 
user2: The first one was so highly rated. 
user1: Yes, hard to remake an original.Now...is Jaws the movie we are supposed to be reviewing.  I didn't see where they asked us to talk about Jaws, did you?
user2: I am supposed to be talking about Jaws. 
user2: I'm sure they couldn't do a re-make that would do the original Jaws justice. Spielberg just has a talent most directors now days could only dream about having. 
user1: Okay, just wanted to be sure.  Thanks.Actually, one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Richard Dreyfuss watches Quincy crush the soda can with his bare hands and then Richard crushes his Styrofoam cup in his hand to act macho. lol 
user1: Yeah...I haven't really found a Steven Spielberg movie that I didn't love.  He is great!
user1: If you watch the DVD, I believe they even have bloopers/behind-the-scenes from the movie at the end. 
user2: I wonder how many movies he's directed in his career? 
user1: I'd guess over 50.  Some of which we may not have heard of if they were in his much younger days.
user2: The part where the girl that's skinny dipping gets pulled under.... I had nightmares about for weeks after seeing it!
user1: YES!  I used to go out in the water as far as she did in that movie.  I never did that again afterwards.
user1: How about when the human head popped out of that sunken boat's hole??
user1: Scared the bajeebers outta me!!
user2: Oh my word. I screamed ... thankfully I didn't see it in theaters!
user1: And when that one guys leg floated down to the bottom of the ocean.  Yikes!
user1: I did like that they used some actual shark footage to make it look more real.
user2: Yeah! That was terrifying. 
user2: Just thinking about it makes the hair on my arms stand up.
user1: Absolutely!  That was the first shark movie I ever saw and it set the stage for so man more shark movies to follow.  Some of the sequels did get a little ridiculous to watch, right?
user2: I don't think I ever saw any sequels. 
user1: The 3D one was so silly.  :D
user2: Now I never watch thrillers. It's always more kid friendly movies. 
user1: Nothing beats the orig
user1: Did you leave, Ashley?

conversation:
user1: Hello, I understand we're supposed to chat about a movie?
user2: Yes, Jaws
user1: Jaws.  The one from the 1980s?
user2: Yes, the one and only. I'm not sure what to do, and the instructions are gone
user1: Look under the tasks section for the instructions.  Who starred in the movie?  
user2: OK, got it.
user2: Roy Scheider as the policeman, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter, a young Richard Dreyfus an ovceanographer
user1: Is it scary?
user2: We need 3 comments apiece about the paragraph I see.
user2: I saw it on TV   a few months ago, and it's still scary. i recommend it to you.
user1: I don't know.  I don't like movies that are too long or too scary.  Are there any female characters or are there just three guys sitting on a boat?
user2: No, there are females, but nt in any starring roles.
user2: the next paragraph is up
user1: So what exactly is the plotline?  Why is it called Jaws?  Does anyone get killed?
user2: The stupid mayor hides the first shark attack, because he doesn't want to lose the tourist trade.
user1: Oh yeah.  Where was the movie filmed?  Where does it take place?
user2: We cross-posted. I type slowly. Ask me  another
user1: Where does the movie take place?  
user2: Police chief accepts first attack as "a boating " accident. Then there's a second attack.
user1: What happens after the second attack?
user2: It's in a fictional New England tourist town, Amity.
user2: After the 2nd one, the mayor fesses up and they hire a shark hunter, Quint.
user1: Who plays Quint?
user2: The great Brit actor, Robert Shaw.  We have enough for this paragraph
user1: What do you mean?
user1: Hello are you still there?
user2: I have paragraphs of info here, and we're supposed to discuss each one with 3 comments apiece. Local fisherman catch a tiger shark, and the Mayor  declares the beach is safe. On July 4, someone else is eaten
user1: After the next person is eaten what does Quint do?
user2: I'm here, and at the last paragraph. They all set out on Quint's boat, Hooper dives in a shark-proof cage, which is destroyed. Quint is eaten.
user1: That's gross.  Who plays Hooper?  What happens to him?
user2: Brody is Richard Dreyfus.  The boat is sinking, he stuffs a scuba tank into the shark's mouth.  Then he shoots it with a rifle, and it explodes with the shark.
user2: I meant Hooper is R Dreyfus.
user2: Brody and Hooper clink to some wreckage and paddle towards shore. 
user2: I think that's the 4th paragraph.

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hello
user1: Not 100% on what we are supposed to discuss.. Have you seen the movie?
user2: ya..
user2: Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film
user2: How many time have you seen the Film nu pesu
user2: Have you seen that film ?

conversation:
user1: Hey how are you doing tonight?
user2: Doin great
user2: Boy Jaws is a real classic.
user1: Yea it really is the first time I saw it I was a little girl
user2: The shark was so realistic
user1: Yea I live near a beach and it made me not ever want to go swimming 
user2: The movie was really done well with fantastic actors.
user1: Yes it was and anything that spielberg does is a hit 
user2: Roy S is one of my favorite actors.
user1: I really like Richard Dreyfuss 
user2: They say it was the scariest movie ever made.
user1: Really I didn't know that 
user2: I hope that I have the chance to see it again.
user1: Yea I would like to see it again because it has been a while since I saw it 
user2: Have you ever seen a real shark like on the movie?
user1: I don't that a lot of the younger generation will ever understand how much of a classic it is
user1: No I have not and hopefully I never get the chance to 
user1: How about you?
user2: nope but it would be kool
user1: Have you ever been to a beach?
user2: yeah but I am always looking for sharks
user1: Yea I am to I do not like to go to far in the water though. I would hate to hear that song playing I would really run out of the water. 
user2: My favorite part was when Hooper fins the shark's tooth.
user1: I really enjoyed every time I heard the music because I knew the shark was on its way and I was about to jump 
user2: My second favorite part is when Hooper is in the cage.
user1: I also liked when Qunt,Brody, and Hooper went out to search for the shark 
user2: I get scared just talking about the movie.
user1: Yea are you a fan of thriller movies? 
user2: Yes as long as there are no sharks.

conversation:
user2: Do you believe the movie was casted well?
user1: I do.  I especially liked Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper.
user2: Think that he showed the right emotion for the movie?
user1: I think so.  He's a very expressive actor.  Do you think I could take my 7 year old child to see it or would it be too scary?
user2: I think that they would be a bit afraid especially with the movie soundtrack and build of of tense sounds
user1: Yeah, that makes sense.  Don't want to be dealing with nightmares.
user2: yea, people are already afraid of sharks and the way spielberg potrays great whites they will never want to go in the water again
user1: For sure.  I will definitely think twice about getting in the water after watching Jaws.

conversation:
user2: Have you seen Jaws?
user1: I have!
user2: I did not know that it was based on a novel. Did you?
user1: Actually no I did not, I wonder if the book is better than the movie? The movie is a classic so it would be hard to top!
user2: I agree.
user2: Steven Spielberg is a fantastic director.
user1: He does an amazing job of creating fear without even showing the Shark in alot of scenes
user2: Yes, definitely not a movie you want to watch if you are thinking of going to the beach. I know it scared more than one kid from the water.
user1: I bet, I def would not let my kiddos watch the film, waaaay too much for kids. 
user2: I agree. I can't remember when I first watched it but I know I enjoy watching it now. It's interesting how actors such as RIchard Dreyfus and Roy Scheider look like real people, not overly polished like today's actors.
user1: Thats part of the genius of the movie. The actors seem like real people!
user2: The skinny dipping scene, I can't help feel like that was the morality piece to keep teens in line. All good scary movies seem to employ this aspect.
user1: Agreed, its a smart tactic because they know the demographic will empathize  
user2: I also like how they address the fact that so many times money is more important than people.
user2: Some things never change.
user1: Its a sad fact, those in power care only for their best interests not the public. Also another reason the movie is relatable 
user2: Do you think Amity is supposed to be Nantucket? Or Martha's Vineyard?
user1: I know Amity Island is fictional but I am not sure what is it based on reference wise
user2: It's hard to believe the movie was made in 1975.
user1: Yeah it was way ahead of its time, it is also crazy the book only came out 1 year before the movie!
user2: Yes, the got to work fast.
user1: They should have hired quint after the first attack!
user2: I agree.
user2: It was a man eating shark after all.
user1: A huge one! Shame he dropped that tooth he found
user1: They should have gotten a bigger boat  for the hunt lol
user2: Lol! It's a shame he didn't lose all of them or maybe he wouldn't have eaten their boat.
user1: hahaha now all I can picture is a giant shark trying to gum people to death lol
user1: It's also funny to me they named the shark hunting boat the "Orca"
user2: I'm not sure I would agree with the most cheerfully perverse movie ever.
user2: Ok, but now that you mention it...maybe it was cheerfully perverse.
user1: It would have been cheerfully perverse if the killing of the shark drew hundreds of other sharks in and the issue escalated out of control haha
user2: Sharks everywhere. Just close Amity beaches. Not so friendly anymore.
user2: So, is it true you don't feel sympathy for any of the characters
user2: Let's get this show on the road....
user1: Im sure thats perspective but I would agree there was no sympathy 
user2: I know. I guess that was part of the genius of it all.
user2: Nice chatting with you!
user1: I would def like to watch it again!
user1: Same!
user2: Me too!
user2: It's like a slice of Americana!

conversation:
user2: I love sharks
user2: It was too gruesome for children but I loved it
user2: I almost felt like a rat given shock therapy
user1: oot emjkjjloog dmyllaer Ioot eM
user1: oops, sorry. lol
user1: I liked the movie, but it was gruesome for sure.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi!
user2: This seems like a good movie that everyone enjoys.
user1: yes
user1: have you seen jaw?
user2: Yes I remember not feeling very bad for the characters that got eaten by the shark.
user2: Have you watched it?
user1: yes
user2: What did you think?
user1: this is the movies we have to talk about
user2: Yes it seems so
user1: it was bad about the people that got ate.
user2: True. The first one was surprising and scary.
user1: when i first seem this movie was scary to get in the water.
user2: Yes. The water parts were definitely the most scary in the movie.
user2: I would have been staying on land where nothing bad happened!
user1: yes
user1:  did seen the shark was after the whole family?  
user1: wow.
user2: Yea it looked like the shark was really smart in the movie
user2: And everyone thought they caught it, but it was the wrong one
user1: yes
user2: They probably should have kept people away from the beaches, but made a mess of things instead.
user1: how he get so smart? yes they should have.
user1: it make me want to go find this movie on nexflex 
user2: Me too!
user1: but i hate the killing
user2: It's kind of corny, but a good throwback movie
user2: The ending was certainly exciting
user1: yes. you can laugh at this one now
user2: After seeing it once yes. The first time it was more scary than funny
user2: It's a good thriller
user1: long time ago i  was scary. it look like he never got full. lol
user2: I wouldn't let my kids watch it until they're older though
user2: Ha! That sounds about right
user1: it can out 1979
user2: I was so glad they finally got the shark, but at the same time I was waiting for it to jump out of the water once more
user2: Yea it's been around a while
user1: how many jaw movies can out?
user2: I don't remember any beyond the first one actually. I know there were more, but not sure how many
user2: Steven Spielberg has always been good at that kind of movie
user1: yes he was i like the bird movie as well
user2: I think we can press finish conversation at the bottom now. Nice talking to you!
user1: you too.

conversation:
user2: I don't know what the film is, no document here
user1: the movie is Jaws
user2: cool. At least I have seen it
user1: did you like it
user2: oh way liked. I was living on the jersey shore opposite Lon Island that year. Sharks everywhere
user1: thats great, it was a little scary but a great watch
user1: spielberg is a great director
user2: the only thing more irritating than sharks are jelly fish. Spielberg is a verifiable genius in his field
user2: hey, don't go
user2: wehat to do now? Hmm

conversation:
user1: Jaws is one of those all-time great movies from an era that American film was starting to come into its own
user2: What did you like about it specifically?
user1: The special effects that were used were one of the greatest things about the movie as it started a movement in cinema of using special effects that has culminated into today's special effects.
user2: It sounds like it was ahead of it's time. Isn't the movie a little bit older?
user1: It is a little older, its about 40 years old now, but it has stood the test of time.
user2: So what is so good about it. I find it odd that it's basically a movie about a big fish. Why should I watch it?
user1: Its a story about a small town that is on edge due to shark attacks and one man's quest to rid the town of the terror of this shark.
user2: Oh. Now that makes it sound a lot more interesting. Are the characters good in it? Clearly the Shark must be star, but who else shines?
user1: Martin Brody is the main star whom is the police chief of the town and he is the main protagonist in the film.  
user2: Interesting. Who portrays him? Is there anybody famous from the movie...Outside of Jaws.
user1: Roy Scheider is Chief Brody.  
user2: Anybody else in it?
user1: Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary.
user2: Oh nice.
user2: What other movies does it compare to?
user1: I would say it compares to other monster type movies such as King Kong or Godzilla
user2: Do you think it's better than them?
user1: I think the original is always better, however, I do have a soft spot for Godzilla movies.
user1: And Godzilla movies were a bit before Jaws.
user2: Makes sense
user2: How long is the movie?
user2: Is there a lot of action to keep me interested?
user1: Its nonstop action from the opening sequence.  I believe its an hour and half long
user2: that's not to bad
user2: I think I'm going to have to check it out
user1: Its worth checking out definitely.
user2: Classic movies are always a way to go
user1: They are.  Most movies nowadays are computerized and takes away from the art.
user2: Do you think they will try and remake it to make it modern? 
user1: Perhaps one day, but Spielberg is still alive so I doubt it any time soon
user2: Hopefully they do it more like the original as you stated. Makes it more real, and not animation
user1: One can only hope.

conversation:
user2: Hi how are you
user2: How is your day 
user1: it's going ok, how about you?
user2: So far so good thanks
user1: did you read about the movie?
user2: How you seen that movie Kaws
user1: Kaws? I haven't heard of it. What's it about?
user2: Jaws yes i did
user1: What's it about?
user2: I meant to say Jaws lol
user1: I think I've seen it at some point. Is it a scary movie?
user2: Its a movie made in the late 70s where people are been hunted by a large shark
user2: Well more like action seems people are always been attack by the shark
user1: I've definitely seen it. I always think about it when I'm at the beach
user2: Really wow its kind of scary if you are in the deep 
user2: There's like a trilogy of this movie right?
user1: YES! Especially if something randomly touches your leg.
user1: I think so. I know there was definitely a Jaws 2, and I think there was another one that took place in some sort of aquarium or research center, but I could be thinking of something else
user2: I live in los Angeles so theres a lot of coast around here
user1: I'm on the opposite coast and they are always tracking sharks (especially great whites) but it seems they generally don't really show up til fall or winter
user2: I still dont like swimming in the ocean i think its dangers
user2: They are looking for warmer waters 
user1: it can be, but I enjoy it anyway... until I see a fin pop up lol
user2: The thing in this movie that the shark its hard to kill
user1: Yeah, I wonder how many different ways they tried to kill him? I never thought to count.
user2: Lol
user1: And he seems super smart for a creature with such a small brain
user2: Yes i know 
user2: I saw that movie as a kid and i was freak out with sharks seems then
user1: Me too! And I rode a Jaws themed ride at Universal Studios as a kid and then I was done.
user1: Every time I went to the beach and saw a fin I thought it was a shark, even if it was really just a dolphin.
user2: Yes they do alike when they are on the water same fin
user2: Thank You for your time

user2: Hi there
user2: How's it going?
user2: Hello?
user1: Hello! it is going well. Have you ever heard of the movie Jaws, by Steven Spielberg?
user2: I have!
user2: Who are the main actors?
user1: It is a great movie. The main actors are Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Lorraine Gray. 
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 97%, so it must be good.
user2: That's right Richard Dreyfuss was really young in that movie.
user2: Wow that's surprising that it's that high
user2: are there any other ratings?
user1: Metacritics gave it an 87/100 and IMDB gives it an 8.0/10
user2: Not bad.
user2: What is the main storyline?
user1: A massive man-eating shark terrorizes beachgoers on Amity Island. A few town men and a shark hunter/marine biologist go on a mission to kill the shark and give peace to the summer town. 
user2: What year did this come out?
user1: I believe it came out in 1975. Must be a great movie if we're still talking about it now!
user2: No kidding. 
user2: What else can you tell me about it?
user1: I've seen it before, but I forgot that they put a $10,000 bounty on the shark, resulting in a frenzy of crazy town people trying to kill it. Not sure if that money is worth it. 
user2: Ha you'd have to pay me more than that
user1: Nope, that's a lie, the local professional shark hunter charged $10,000. Misread the information. 
user2: haha no worries
user2: I don't remember that part either
user1: BUT the crazies shark hunting caught a tiger shark and everyone thought, "oh I GUESS we're safe."
user1: Nope, they were not. They were not safe. 
user2: ...but they were wrong!
user2: and then what happened?
user1: Of course, somebody had to go looking and diving, and they found a sunken ship with a massive sharks tooth in the hull. Oh and a body. 
user2: Was the body half eaten?
user2: no self respecting shark would leave a perfectly good body laying around
user1: Of course, how else would we know there was still a shark in the movie?
user2: Excellent
user1: So then the crazy men set out on the Orca to hunt the shark. 
user2: the orca is the ship right?
user1: Yes, a very apt ship name since I think sharks eat Orcas. 
user2: hehehe
user1: Clever, Spielberg, clever
user2: they're gonna need a bigger boat
user1: haha
user2: Thanks for the info
user1: Absolutely, thank you for being such a wonderful chat partner. The ship sinks btw

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello!  What do you think about the movie?  Do you have children/think the movie would be appropriate for children?
user2: I think it was a pretty great movie 
user2: I do not have any children 
user2: What do you think of this movie ?
user1: I do too!  It is a little gruesome, but enjoyable nonetheless!  Maybe not so good for children, but then again it's not as gruesome as some of the newer movies out today. 
user2: Yeah thats true some of the newer movies are pretty gruesome ! 
user2: Im pretty shocked that imdb rated this 8.0 out of 10 thats pretty good
user1: That is really good!  I'm surprised too!  Although, I think Steven Spielburg movies usually do fairly well. 
user2: Yeah thats true they usually do very good
user1: I feel the movie was fairly well produced, given it's year of 1975.  And it's still so relative today!
user2: Yeah i feel the same! 
user2: what was your favorite scene from the movie 
user1: I would have to say when the great white attacked the folks on the beach, that was pretty classic.  
user1: What was yours?
user2: Thats also my favorite scene !
user1: I wonder, if the movie was created today if it would still be considered a "thriller", or would it be considered pretty bland since it'd be up against more technologically advanced movies of today. 
user2: Yeah i know what you mean , i heard a rumor they might re make it .  Im not sure if i would see it , i wouldnt wanna ruin my experience thus far with this film !
user2: Rotten tomatoes rated this 9.2 out of 10 thats also very good i just noticed that
user1: This is the first I'm hearing about it; I wonder if that's true!  I think it's such a good movie though because it was one of the best movies of it's time.  I would hate to see a remake now and be disappointed just because it's "just like all the others" if you know what i mean.  Back then, this was something special, may not really be anymore if they remade it.  
user1: Oh wow, me too!  That's an awesome score for rotten tomatoes; they usually give rotten scores lol. 
user2: lol yeah they usually do give rotten scores
user2: I trust IMDB now for reviews how about you ?
user1: I think I trust them pretty well too. 
user1: Is Amity Island a real place, do you know?
user2: I have no idea i was curious about that 
user1: Speaking of how the movie would be made differently these days, I bet the skinny dipping scene would make it X-rated lol.  I'm sure they would take that to the extreme just for ratings! Ew!
user2: lol yeah it would be .  Yeah for ratings i could see that happening lol
user1: Anything for views these days!
user1: Have you ever been at the beach where there was a shark sighting?
user2: Very true ! 
user2: i have actually when i was in florida it was pretty scarY!  Have you even seen a shark sighting ?
user1: That would be terrifying!  I had that happen as well...kind of.  As it turns out, it was a false alarm from a "funny" kid who thought it would be humorous - kind of like this movie actually! The poor kid had no idea how greatly it would effect the beachgoers.  His parents were not very happy and neither were any of the folks that thought it was real!
