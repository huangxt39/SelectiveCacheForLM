Steve Carell as Gru, a mean supervillain
Jason Segel as Victor "Vector" Perkins, Mr. Perkins' son and Gru's archenemy
Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, Gru's elderly gadget man and a friendly scientist

critical response:
Since villains so often steal the show in animation, Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru.
Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D.
Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater.
Short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but be likable.
It's no first-rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quality over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Fun, with teary bits, for kids; fresh and smart for adults.

description:
Gru, a supervillain, is disheartened when an unknown supervillain steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. Gru, with the assistance of his colleague Dr. Nefario and his Minions, resolves to one-up this mystery rival by shrinking and stealing the Moon. As it would be costly to steal the moon, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Bank president Mr. Perkins is impressed by the plan but will provide the money only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first. Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain named Vector was responsible for the pyramid theft, Gru starts a rivalry with him. 
Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals the shrink ray. The girls then suggest a day at a theme park; Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there, but instead he warms up to them. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, stating that he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and Perkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his operations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girls offer the contents of their piggy bank. Gru, inspired, sells parts of his lair to construct a spacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest the Earth, but this is the same day as the girls' ballet recital. Gru becomes conflicted, and Dr. Nefario, seeing the recital as interfering with the plan, arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage. At the same time, Perkins informs Vector, revealed to be Perkins' son, of Gru's possession of the shrink ray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to act. 
Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon, and rushes back to Earth to attend the recital only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered that the effects of the shrink ray are temporary; the bigger the object's original size, the faster the shrinkage will wear off. As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's ship and launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it. 

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user1: Did you like the movie Despicable Me?
user2: I did not realize this movie came out in 2010, that seemed so long ago.

conversation:
user2: Hello, have you seen the movie Despicable Me?
user1: no, never saw it. any good?
user2: It was quite cute! Created by Illumination Entertainment in 2010, the main story follows an aging Supervillian named "Gru."  Gru has a posse of "minions" who do the heavy lifting for him.  
user1: It has a funny title. 
user1: so i guess Gru is despicable?
user2: It does: but, it's appropriate.  One of the central conflicts in the film revolves around Gru's perception of himself.  As the "super villian", he sees himself as a "despicable" person. However, during the course of the movie, you see that he actually has a very big heart
user2: He ends up adopting three girls and learns to parent creatively and ends up choosing "his girls" over the chance to be the bigger villain on earth.
user1: Is it an animation?
user2: Yes!  And, a well crafted one, at that.  It was produced by Universal.   It's obviously digitally animated.  More along the lines of Pixar movies.  And, the soundtrack is amazing.
user1: Interesting. is it kid friendly?
user2: Very much so!  But, as a bonus, there are some clever inside jokes that play to parents and grandparents.  It's definitely appropriate for a family movie night.   The overall theme is the importance of family and teaamwork.
user2: Steve Carrel does some amazing voice work, as the main character.
user1: Ah that sounds good...though I wouldn't mind seeing this plot with Catwoman in the lead
user1: What tunes are in the soundtrack that u mentioned.
user2: I'm not sure Cat Woman would fit well, in this case.  Really, It pokes fun at the concept of super villains and the  stereotypical "crimes" they often pursue.   Gru, in this movie, wants to steal the moon...but is foiled by another up-and-coming super villain.  In the end, he ends up giving the moon to his girls...which is  a cute stereotype of a good father.
user2:  Pharrel wrote the main theme song and performs it: the lyrics are peppy and comical.  There are other contemporary and classical pieces that help weave the narrative together.
user1: wow...that really sounds original. never seen anything like that
user2: It is an original concept, for sure.  If you tend towards an appreciation for silly humor, the minions have  you covered. They often get themselves into very Rube-Goldberg-esque shennanigans.
user1: I liked Monsters ( the movie). in it the monsters are under the bed, but turn out to be friendly. Great movie to take the kids to. 
user2: It received numerous, positive reviews. I would recommend seeing it.  Kids will definitely like it.8
user1: Any superheros?
user2: Well, that's the take away- being a super hero or a super villain is entirely your choice. Gru ends up being a super hero by vanquishing Vector (the up-and-coming villain).
user2: So, would you go see this movie?
user1: Sometimes I think my kids will choose the latter. I need to indoctrinate the better.
user1: Yeah. gotta organize a movie night for it. popcorn, etc.
user1: did u see it with kids, btw?
user2: Sounds like a good plan.  Make sure you have bananas- the minions like them.
user2: Yes, I saw the movie with my children.
user1: They liked it?
user2: They loved it.  They spent the next few days speaking in "minion speak".  
user1: uh-oh
user2: It's not a bad thing.  Have you ever listened to kids try to speak pig latni?

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hey, what do you think about Despicable Me?  It's a really good movie.
user1: I think so too.
user1: It's quite funny!
user1: Did you just read about it? Or have you seen it also.
user2: Yeah?  Steve Carell is super funny.  My kids love this movie.
user1: Yeah he plays gru really well.
user2: I've seen it.
user1: Oh, I don't have kids, but I think the movie is good for all ages
user2: I recommend it to my friends.
user1: Lots of good lessons in it
user1: Same here
user2: And the animation is really top level.
user1: Yeah it is, simple but not too simple, and just detailed enough
user1: I like all the small details in the movie, and how gru evolves over time
user1: what's your favorite character in the movie?
user2: I also like Gru.  He's the funniest of the characters by far.
user1: Same here. And it has a lot of rewatching value
user1: Always find new things and easter eggs
user2: Yeah I've probably seen it a dozen times.

user2: Who is the other minions you know aside from kevin?
user1: bob
user1: what was the other main character? Do you remember. 
user2: Oh, I like bob too. I also like the personality of other minions.
user2: I also remember Victor and Dr. Nefario.
user1: Those girls really have Gru wrapped around their finger.
user1: Lol, victor was the funny.
user2: Yeah, Victor was really funny too. When was the last time you watched this movie?
user1: probably like 6 months ago
user1: I liked that the little guys win. 
user1: Just goes to show that size doesn't matter
user2: Oh, that was a long time ago. I watched it just last week. It was a 2010 movie but I love to watched it all over again.
user1: Wow! Yeah, it's been awhile for me!
user2: what is your favorite part of the movie?
user1: When Gru gets his girls back. They really bring a while new meaning to his life.

user2: yes, Despicable me. It's an animated movie that came out a few yers ago
user1: nice that's sound interested. can you tell me a little bit about it?
user1: would an adult also enjoy the movie?
user2: Sure, it stars Steve Carrell as a supervillan, with Russell Brand as his scientist/partner in crime. It was directed by Pierre Coffin..

user2: Yes, it comes in 3d and regular 
user1: nice
user2: Do you want to know the plot?
user1: i like steve carrell, he was funny in other movies i have seen him in as well. i think it would be funny to see him doing a animated voice over.
user1: no please tell me a little bit about it
user1: yes i mean lol
user2: it really is! It is designed very well, and his personality comes through in the animation. Steve Carrell is trying to steal the moon after another villan steals the Pyramid at Giza
user1: oh wow that sound interesting. what age group would you see this movie is made for?
user2: I would say it's for young kids all the way up to adults. It is a good blend of silly and intelligent humor
user1: is there alot of singing in the movie? i dont particular like musical type movies but my kids do?
user2: there's a song written just for this movie by Pharell. It's not too much music, and it's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing constantly, but there are characters called Minions that dance and act very silly
user1: oh ok. lol sounds like my kind of movie. I'm a big kid at heart
user1: is the movie pretty long or standard?
user2: me too, I really enjoyed it. It's a good mix of funny and feel-good, Gru eventually adopts three little girls who help him steal the moon. It is not too long, maybe 1.5 hours
user1: oh that is not bad at all. i think i will look forward to seeing this movie with my kids. should keep their attention for awhile. lol
user2: lol it definitely will! although they might just want to watch it over and over again
user1: cool, this definitely helped me out . oh hey is this a disney movie or who is it made by?
user2: It's made by a French studio Mac Guff, but Illumination Entertainment bought the studio and released this movie with Universal Pictures.
user1: oh wow i didn't know universal had their hands in animation. 
user2: i didn't either, I think maybe they're involved because it was a Computer Animated film
user1: oh. makes sense
user2: will you watch it with your children or let them watch it while you do other things?
user1: i thiink i would like to watch it with them. Sounds like it may be fun for the whole family.

conversation:
user1: I really like the movie and how it covers the view from a villain's perspective.
user2: I agree. I also liked the movie and really enjoyed that it was a family film.
user1: The Minions provide an extra dose of humor too
user2: Yes, they are a favorite among many people.
user2: Do you like animated films?
user1: Yes I do, especially since I have kids
user1: Do you have kids?
user2: I do, I did not realize that this was a debut film.  I assumed it was one of the more familiar animation company films.
user1: Yes, it was the first film in the franchise from a few years ago
user2: Is there going to be a new paragraph showing up?
user2: Nevermind, there it is
user2: It's funny to see a movie where two villians are against each other rather than a hero and a villian
user1: I agree
user1: It makes it almost more enjoyable since it is a new spin
user1: It got pretty good reviews too
user2: Exactly.  
user2: The actor's performances and the minions contributed to the reviews greatly. 
user2: A cast that everyone grew to love.
user1: Yes, I didn't realize Russell Brand was in it
user1: And I am not sure these directors have done anything else noteworthy?
user2: Other than this movie series, I do not believe so.
user1: Well I always have loved Steve Carell
user2: yes, he is a funny actor
user1: Although the future Minions movie wasn't as good
user2: I have not seen that yet.  I remember the scene where Gru couldn't decide whether to go to the recital or steal the moon.
user1: And he made the right decision at the end
user1: It really made you feel good about the character
user2: Right, even villians have a good side
user2: My son thought the moon expanding with the ship was so funny
user2: He kept saying that the shrinking would wear off 
user2: He then thought Gru should try to help Vector off the moon 
user1: Yea. Now I want to see the movie again!
user2: Me too.  Watch it with my son again after all these years
user2: see if he still gets a kick out of the movie since he's a teenager now
user1: YeaThe girls are great in it too
user1: so all genders should enjoy it!

conversation:
user2: I can not believe the movie did not get higher rating it was funny
user1: I completely agree. The punch lines were great.
user1: Russell Brand was a great choice to play Dr. Nefario.
user2: I totally agree
user2: did you see the movie in 3d it was really good
user1: It's definitely a movie for all ages. 
user1: I saw it in 3d in the theater and have seen it many times in it's regular format at home.
user1: It is a favorite among my children.
user2: this is kind of hard there is only so much you can talk about
user1: I agree. 
user1: The paragraphs give you limited information to talk about, it's much easier to speak of personal experiences with this movie.
user1: I am glad the movie at least recieved an A score for CinemaScore. 
user2: yeah I agree ,
user2: The moon thing was funny
user1: The moon thing was hilarious. 
user1: It's such a great and ridiculous super villian idea.
user2: well you know you can not trust the banker he is paying to steal the moon
user1: Very true. I love that it's the Bank of Evil. That cracks me up. It's perfect for the movie.
user1: I also really enjoyed Vector as a villain. Stealing the pyramid was hilarious.
user2: I like pixar fims
user1: I do too. They are generally as amusing for adults as they are kids.
user1: I love the scene when the girls interrupt the video chat. It's so typical of kids.
user2: hey the play with the girls with the cookies at vectors house was smart
user1: It was such a great idea.  Perfect ploy.
user2: oh the theme park was funny 
user1: I loved seeing Gru really develop love for the girls over time. It was very adorable and heart warming.
user2: you just knew the girls were going to interrupt the meeting their kids
user1: I loved the scene when Gru has to rescue the girls.
user2: oh yeah i agree
user1: And the moon getting bigger in Vector's ship was hilarious.
user1: I also loved all of the interactions between Dr. Nefario and any other character. They were hilarious. Russell Brand really was the perfect choice for him.
user2: it was very touching when the girls offered the money from their piggy bank
user1: It was. It was so sweet. And the minions were so loyal to Gru as well. It was adorable.
user2: I was happy vector got stuck on the moon
user1: As was I. It was an excellent way for him to end up. Fitting for how pouty and childish he was the entire time.
user2: yead definately a spoiled child well I just counted and the conversation and it has been 15 comments we should be done with the task

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hello I would like to discuss the movie Despicable Me
user2: ok, sounds good to me
user2: have you seen it before?
user1: Yes it is a great movie that stars a character named Gru who is the voice of Steve Carrell.
user2: I love Steve Carrell!
user2: Is it a childrens' movie?
user1: Yes it a family friendly movie that is an animation movie. 
user2: Ok, I think I have seen advertisements before. Is it with the minions or is that something else?
user1: It is a movie that stars the character Gru who steals the spotlight as a villain.
user2: NIce, that sounds like it would be good for adults too. Who else is in it?
user1: It also have a character named Vector who is the voice of Jason Segel. Vector is Gru's archenemy.
user2: oh cool. I like Jason Segel too. Anything else you can tell me about the movie?
user2: I don't know if you are multitasking or what, but this is incredibly frustrating waiting for your answers and we still need 10 responses each, so I am leaving.
user1: I believe it'll be a you'll enjoy. It has great ratings for a family friendly movie. It hasa 81% on Rotten Tomatoes.

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user2: Hello
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: I saw it a long time ago but do not remember it well. You?
user1: I also watched it a long time ago
user1: It was cute. 
user2: It was. Mostly what I remember is that it introduced the minions that everyone is so obsessed about.
user1: That's all I really remember too
user2: I didn't know it was directed by people who had never directed a movie before. That's interesting.
user1: I thought it was great how all the minions had to work together
user1: It is! And it was so popular too
user2: Very popular. I do love Steve Carrell, I feel like I should go rewatch it.
user1: I forgot they stole the moon
user1: Oh my, and Vector
user2: And the Great Pyramid of Giza. 
user1: He is a funny character
user2: Jason Segel is very funny. I guess I didn't realize Russell Brand was in this.
user1: I didn't either
user1: I need to rewatch this too
user2: I wonder why it only got a 6.8/10. I don't even love animation but it's cute.
user1: Did this one also have the girls in it
user2: Apparently so, yes.
user1: Yeah, that is weird. I don't like how rotten tomatoes scores though
user1: yeah, I just read that. lol
user2: lol the reading makes the movie seem much darker than it was.
user1: It really does. 
user1: I guess seeing it on film and reading it really makes a difference
user2: It must. Because the bit about them being returned to an orphanage seems really... depressing
user1: It does!
user1: But thankfully, Gru gets them back
user1: I forgot the girls and the minions helped to save the day
user2: Yes... I get that bad guys do bad things but why would he want to steal the girls after he got the shrink ray and the moon?
user2: Vector clearly does not like the girls. Why keep them?
user1: just to be a jerk
user2: Ha! So true.
user1: he would probably use them for bad if he got them anyways
user1: I doubt that the girls would listen to him thought

conversation:
user2: Steve Carell is great as Gru. Perfect supervillain.
user2: What do you think about the animation genre?
user2: I don't know how Rotten Tomatoes could give it an 81%, but CinemaScore gave it an A.
user1: it's an excellent movie but the average rating of 6.8/10 dosen't justify to me :)
user1: it should be rated bit higher
user1: agreed
user2: Do you usually watch movies that have that kind of score?
user1: i believe the rating has both critics & normal users like us ratings
user1: i normally go by movie trailers..
user1: if the trailer is good...I watch it
user1: what about you? 
user2: I generally like to watch movies in the animation genre, particularly ones produced by French studios.
user1: gotcha...I wouldn't necessarily go by movie studios but my general observation is....disney's, dreamworks & studio ghibli movies are excellent
user2: Any movie where the main character is described as a megalomaniacal rogue has to be good!
user1: by the way...do you know if this movie directors made other animation movies?
user2: No, this was his feature debut film.
user1: lol i never check who directs/casts the movies in general....
user1: ok
user2: My favorite part was when Gru had to get a bank loan. What NAICS code would that go under?
user1: what's NAICS code? Not sure of this
user2: It's probably not a thing in a move where you are shrinking the moon, with a name like the Bank Of Evil.
user1: lol :)
user1: so do you agree with critics responses on the movie?
user1: "Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater
user2: For the most part. I do agree that it is a different type of movie from Pixar.
user1: I atleast do not agree with 'and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater.'...part
user1: atleast I was smiling for a whole lot time after watching the movie
user1: & I had some arguments with my wife even now as we chat
user2: It was sad how Dr. Nefario (great name BTW) tried to get the girls to back to the orphanage. Broke my heart.
user1: well a movie has to have mixed emotions
user1: this way viewers always stay focussed on what might happen
user2: I'm surprised he didn't stick to his minions. If I had minions, I'd use them for all sorts of crazy stuff, like stealing the moon.
user1: may be thaey are just a comedy element & most of the time Gru & family SAVIOURS
user1: i like the way emotions were shown for the 3 adopted girls
user1: it gives a message how important a family is...so kids have something to learn atleast while having fun
user2: I agree. They did a good job with the contrast of wanting to leave them at an amusement part to adopting them.
user1: i also like how science was incorporated into a fictitious movie
user1: well as an adult most knew moon cannot be shrinked but the portrayal was very genuine & seems natural
user2: Right? I wonder if the temporary effect of the shrink ray is real. I may need to invent one and find out for my self. NO Bank of Evil for me to go to though...
user1: it's such elements that raise goose bumps
user2: I also like how the minions saved the girls, risking their own lives to do it. 
user2: Speaking of science, I wonder if Vector died while on the moon, or he is still living up there in a cartoon induced atmosphere.
user1: do you know what happened after vector got strapped to the moon & it was launched into an orbit?
user1: I dont remember
user2: Me either.

conversation:
user1: Have you ever seen the movie Despicable Me?
user2: No I haven't.  Is that an animated movie?
user1: Yes, one of the best animated movies in the past ten years!
user1: It can't help but be likeable. Audiences loved it for its good punch lines in 3D.
user2: Is that the one with cars? 
user2: I don't ususally go to animated movies.  What actors do the voices?
user1: No, but it is said that the company making the movie was inspired by that company.
user1: Steve Carrell is the main character with Jason Segel and Russell Brand. 
user2: Gosh, I bet it is funny then.  Is it a Pixar movie?
user1: No, it actually is produced by Universal and Illumination.
user2: Oh, ok.  What do the characters do?
user1: Gru is a supervillain who is upset when he hears that someone steals the Great Pyramid. 
user2: So it takes place in Egypt?
user1: Gru wants to beat his competitor and with help of his minions sets out to steal something even better
user1: It actually takes place here in America. 
user2: Ok, who plays the villan?
user1: The villan is played by Jason Segel. 
user2: Who does Russell Brand plan? I think he's hilarious.
user1: Russell Brand plays Dr. Nefario, Gru
user1: Grus
user1: Gru's helper
user2: Who does Steve Carrel play?
user1: Steve Carrell is Gru
user1: Gru is always coming up with the craziest ideas to steal parts to best his villany
user2: Is it fast paced?
user1: Yes, that is what critics enjoyed about the movie. 
user1: You think that you know what is going to happen but suddenly Gru's actions change and Vector is coming up with new plans!
user2: I might have to rent this. It must be funny with those 3 in it.  Are there any women in it?
user1: Yes, Gru adopts three girls in connection with his plan to steal things. 
user2: who plays the 3 girls?
user2: Gru sounds hilarious!
user1: I am not sure about that but the girls play a huge part in the movie. 
user1: He is! He keeps giving up things he achieves just to get better things. 
user2: I'll have to look that info up.
user1: You should!
user2: Thanks.

conversation:
user1: Hey There
user2: Hi! This is about an animated movie, is that ok?
user1: What is the name of the movie?
user2: Despicable Me.
user1: Can you tell me a little about it?
user1: I am all for a good animated movie :)
user2: It's a 2010 movie, about a villain who ends up being the star of the show.
user2: The villain is voiced by Steve Carrell, his character is calledGru.
user1: That's an interesting name.
user1: Are there any other big names in the movie?
user2: Jason Segel voices Victor, and Russell Brand plays the character who is Gru's scientist sidekick, Dr Nefario.
user2: The stars of the show are The Minions, and all of them set off to steal the moon using a Shrinking Ray stolen from another villain, Vector.
user1: So Gru is a villian, is it just about his life?
user1: Are those the little yellow guys?
user2: In a way. Gru tries to borrow money from a "villain's bank", but gets turned down and has to resort to other means to be in with a chance of stealing the moon.
user2: The information I have here does not specify the Minions' colour, alas.
user1: So do the minions work for Gru? Or they are doing their own thing?
user2: It does mention that Vector, the competing villain, stole one of the great Pyramids.
user1: Are the villains competing against each other?
user2: Here's a little more detail now, not much about the Minions other than the fact that Gru, with no loan, cannot afford to pay his Minion workers.
user2: Both Vector and Gru are after the same thing - the shrink ray, and then the moon.
user2: The catch is Vector is related to the director of the Villains Bank...
user1: Do you know what ages this movies is recommended for?
user2: ...and then has to look after some girls that he meets up with.
user1: Is Gru a kid or an adult?
user2: Oh, it's for all ages, with a quote that "Kids will dig it" and "adlts will smile with amusement".
user2: Gru is an adult, Vector is little more than a teenager.
user1: Gru just found the girls or is that another story?
user2: Vector kidnaps the girls in an attempt to get Gru to hand over the Moon, once he has successfully acquired the shrink ray and shrunk the moon.
user2: The information here seems to miss out on how he ends up with some little girls in tow. But they must like him, as one of them offered the contents of her piggy bank when Gru reveals he cannot get a loan from the bank.
user1: It sounds like Gru is kind of a good guy even though he is labeled a villain?
user2: That's a fair assessment. The last bit of info says he actually rescues the girls after Vector has kidnapped them.
user2: Gru gets caught up in the stealing the moon thing, and misses attending the ballet recital that the girls are taking part in.
user1: I'm guessing this one pulls the heartstrings a bit for moms
user1: That's sad.
user2: Oh, I would say so.  The girls, it seems, were from an orphanage.
user1: So he took them in? How many girls?
user2: Gru returns the to the orphanage, but must rejoin them as they all work together when Vector steals the stolen moon.
user2: 3 girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes.
user1: What kind of ratings did this movie get?
user2: Rotten tomatoes rated it 6.8/10, Metacritic 72/100 and Cinemascore gave it an A.
user1: It sure sounds like it is a cute movie
user1: Do you have a favorite part?
user2: The text here says "it's no first-rank CGI cartoon", but is "Fun, with tary bits for kids and fresh and smart for adults."
user2: I wuld have liked to know ore of the interactions with the Minions, actually. I am sure an evil scientist sidekick and many Minions could get up to some mischief!
user1: I bet they could.
user2: No more information has been provided, Would you want to see it based on what I've told you?
user1: I wonder how he acquired the minions
user1: I think I would
user2: I think I would too.

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi! What do you think of this movie?
user2: I think is decent.  Not one pixars best
user2: I think Steve Carell was miscast
user2: He doesn't do it for me as Gru. 
user2: Seems way way too nice. 
user1: Yeah I'd have to agree
user2: If you have kids I recomend something else. 
user1: I can't take any of his roles seriously after seeing him in the office lol
user1: Are there 3 of these movies
user2: i AGREE
user1: ?
user2: I hope not. 
user2: 1 was enough
user1: hahaha I'm pretty sure they made multiple ones
user1: haven't seen any of them though
user2: I have seen 2 sadly. 
user2: Do you have kids?
user1: No but I have a few young nieces so I get to watch movies with them occasionally 
user1: How to Train your dragon is my favorite of all time
user2: Haven't seen that one.  Moana is very good. 
user1: Oh I liked Moana also!  I highly recommend How to Train your Dragon!
user1: I am obviously biased but still
user2: I like old cartoons the most.  
user2: Have you seen Mickey and beanstalk?
user1: No but I'm going to have to now lol
user1: when was it made?
user2: 1960 roughly.
user2: It is on Netflix.
user2: Very good about 30 minutes.  Perfect cartoon
user1: What!?
user1: I do like most of the disney stuff
user1: so I'll have to give it a shot
user1: Do your kids like it?
user2: Yes.  They always fall asleep at the end.
user2: When the harp sings.  
user1: Aww lol how old are they?
user2: 1 and 4
user2: Have a good day!

conversation:
user2: This is some fun movie for kids
user1: it was a great one for sure
user2: What do you think of Steve Carells role as the supervillian
user1: i mean he kind of wasnt towards the end
user1: he redemed himself id say
user2: He sure did. What do you think of the rating.
user1: i think its too low
user1: i never put any thought into rotten tomatos
user2: what about metacritics rating
user1: ehh, it seems closer to accruate
user2: it sure does
user1: i think a huge scene is when he takes the kids to the amusment park
user1: its really the turning point
user2: yes it is
user2: When about the rivalry between the villians?
user1: i think it was great to have gru have his own nemisis
user1: to show more of him having a heart
user2: Yes it makes the movie much more appealing
user2: the part where the girls offer their piggy bank money was really sweet
user1: yeah it really was
user2: The plan to steal the moon was cool
user2: especially since it was the day as the girls recital
user1: i think it was a good, and ridiculous, way to have gru be "bad"
user2: yes it was
user2: how about that plan to steal the moon
user1: it was funny i think
user2: yes it adds to the movie as a fun space addition
user1: i thought that having gru be kind of, i guess, low self esteem about being a villian, showed him as humah
user1: human
user2: yes
user2: he was kind of an anti hero
user2: which makes the money an instant animated classic
user1: exactly! he changes from what you think he would be as a vialian to a normal person
user2: exactly
user2: Overall I think it was a very excellent film
user1: i also love how one person does all the minion voices
user2: Yes they are very good addition.

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: Hey!
user2: Do you like animated films?
user1: Not usually, but I thought this was a good movie.
user2: Oh you have seen despicable me?
user1: Yeah, it's a good one.  I usually am not a fan of a lot of animated stuff, but I like Steve Carell a lot and he's the reason I decided to see it.  What did you think of it?
user2: I thought it was very entrtaining.
user2: I loved steve Carell as Gru.
user1: Ditto.  Not a huge fan of Jason Segel, but it was just his voice, so... :)
user2: lol, very true.
user2: I did not realize russel brand was dr.nefario
user1: Do you try to watch movies with only good ratings?  Or do you watch whatever you think looks good?
user2: A bit of both, this has a high rating 81% rotten tomatoes.

conversation:
user2: Hello! How are you?
user1: good how are you?
user2: Doing great!
user1: I have not seen this movie
user2: What movie are we talking about?
user1: Dispicable me
user2: Hmm, I've not seen that film either. Could you tell me a bit about it?
user1: or I think so??? that is what it says at the top left of the page
user1: it is a Disney animated movie
user1: it is in 3d and I think that it puts the spotlight on the villain more
user1: I have not seen it either
user2: Oh nice, I like animated films. And there's a villain? Nice. What type of reviews did the film get? I like to know what I"m getting into
user1: but I think I may have to give it a try maybe this weekend
user1: it got 81% on rotten tomato 
user1: with an average of 6.8/10 and a cinema score A
user2: Whoa, well that's pretty decent! Must be a good film. Is it a kids film or is it appropriate for adults too?
user1: the reviews are very helpful to me as well
user1: based on the description and the rating I think it might turn out to be a pretty good movie
user1: Disney almost always puts out fantastic movies
user1: very high quality
user1: it is appropriate for all ages
user2: Hmm yeah, they certainly do, though I'd like to know more. Who are the actors in the film? Or voice actors, since it's animated. 
user1: Steve Carell does the voice for the villain Gru
user1: Jason Segel does the voice of Victor
user1: and Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario
user2: Oh wow,  nice, those guys are hilarious. Must be a funny film then, eh?
user1: I think the minions have their hands full in this movie lol
user1: yes it is bound to be funny
user2: Awesome, I'm a big fan of comedies so that makes me want to check it out.
user2: What's the plot?
user1: I love comedies as well
user1: the plot: the villain is trying to steal the great pyramind of giza so he goes to the bank to try to get a loan to pay for this adventure
user1: but the bank wants him to steal a shrink ray in order to get the loan
user2: Haha, that's ridiculous, I love it! 
user1: yes I am definitely going to be watching this 
user1: me too!!  I definitely think it will be hilarious
user1: great cast. great ratings, and a great storyline
user2: I can picture Steve Carrell's character, I'm sure it's a great performance as always. 
user2: Do you know how long this film is?
user1: let me check
user2: I like movies, but don't like them when they're super long!
user1: it does not indicate how long
user1: but with this being a disney film I would say probably 1 1/2 to 2 hrs at most
user2: Hmm, okay, well thanks for the info anyways.
user2: Well, it was great chatting, I'll be sure to check this out!
user2: See ya!
user1: anytime and I hope that you will enjoy Despicable Me
user1: bye

conversation:
user1: HI
user2: HI
user1: WHERE IS THE DOCUMENT?
user2: Have you ever seen dispicable me? I have the doc
user1: YES, I HAVE
user1: FUNNY MOVIE
user2: It has ok ratings on rotten tomatoes. Would you watch it again?
user1: PROBABLY, ITS ONE OF THAT MOVIES THAT YOU CAN WATCH A LOT OF TIMES AND DONT GET BORED
user2: Yeah it's great for kids and adults which is pretty cool.
user2: I didn't realize Gru was played by Steve Carrell.
user1: what!! I didn't know that, interesting
user2: It got a 72/100 on metacritic. Would you agree with that?
user1: mmm... I  think it deserves more 
user2: Definitely. Though it is kind of cliche. I mean gru literally tries to steal the moon.
user2: For a pixar movie I expected more, to be honest.
user1: well, disney bought pixar sooo...
user2: Very true
user2: Did you ever get the dispicable me song stuck in your head?
user1: which one?
user2: The main theme song one
user1: the happy song?
user2: Do you think there's an undertone of adoption acceptance in this movie? I mean Gru, the evil genius, is planning on stealing the mon but warms up to some little girls and ends up taking care of them.
user1: oh, definitely
user1: I think is actually the main topic
user2: Oh interesting
user2: Kind of a cliche ending too though, I mean Vector kidnaps the girls and now Gru has to go get them.
user1: and the surprising final... he did it!!
user2: Haha yup
user2: I can't believe the movie came out in 2010! Doesn't feel 8 years old.
user1: damn!! I'm feeling old... hahaha
user2: Me too! Though the movie has certainly aged well.
user2: What do you think about the part where the shrink ray is only temporary and the moon blows up to it's original sie after a while?
user1: I love that part...
user1: when moon starts to get bigger again
user2: It's certainly an interesting and creative ending!
user2: Well this has been fun! Good luck turking

conversation:
user1: Hi
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: Hey. I can't see anything about the movie. What movie is it?
user1: Its Despicable Me
user1: Do you like animated movies?
user1: This movie has Gru who is the voice of Steve Carell
user2: Oh haha nice. I have younger siblings and cousins so I've seen tons of Dreamworks, Pixar, and Disney movies. How did the critics feel about the movie?
user1: It got a rating of 81 percent on Rotten tomatoes and 72 out of 100 on Metacritic
user1: it's pretty good
user2: That's not bad. I'm assuming it's kid friendly and is comedic?
user1: I think everyone enjoys these kind of movies
user1: There is no real age limit on this
user2: I could only assume so myself. Do you know who does the voice for the big guy with the big nose?
user1: That Gru, Steve Carell
user1: Vector is Jason Segel and Russell Brand is Dr nefano
user2: Ah gotcha. I'm terrible with names. I didn't even know Russell Brand was in it. That's cool. What's it about?
user1: Two super villains trying to attain the same goal by using some wicked tactics against each other. 
user1: one of them is Gru
user2: Can't go wrong with a little bit of violence. How does the movie end?
user1: It has a good mix comedy, drama and emotions
user1: It is not very clear here
user1: I guess you will have to watch it to find out
user2: It's gotta get right into my feelings. Does anyone die? I don't know if my ol' itty bitty heart could take it.
user1: I don't think so, it ends well
user2: Always gotta have the stereotyped happy ending to leave me with feelings of bliss and joy. I'm sure my younger siblings and cousins would love it.
user1: You should watch it, after all it is an animated movie with great quality animation
user1: You can watch it with friends or family
user2: Oh nice. I was afraid it'd be the old school claymation. Perhaps I'll take your advice. Do you think my grandma would like it?
user1: I'm sure, it is pretty heartwarming
user1: I think all age groups enjoy it
user2: That's good to know. What's the saddest part of the movie?
user1: I cannot pin point exactly but it is touching
user1: You won't be disappointed
user1: It did pretty well in theaters
user2: My grandma and I will probably cry together. Which voice actor did the best performance?
user1: Steve Carell
user2: Sweetness. I may have to look into him. Who was it directed by?
user1: Pierre Coffin
user2: The name sounds familiar. Is it a Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks film? Maybe something else entirely?
user1: It's Universal Pictures
user2: The only one I didn't mention. Of course. It sounds like it'd be pretty good though. Even the critics didn't find it too shaby and you seem to have a positive opinion about it. Is there a love interest in the movie?
user2: We can finish the conversation. Have a good day!

conversation:
user1: Despicable Me sounds like its an older film
user1: since the CGI is no first-rank cartoon, it sounds like it may be outdated compared to today's CGI animation films
user2: I had no idea that Despicable me was the debut film for Illumination Entertainment.  Nor did I realize that it was animated by a French animation studio.
user1: Neither did I. I also did not know that Steve Carell was the star of it. they should have advertised that more. maybe I would have gone to see it.
user2: I really don't like to watch films in 3D.  My kids really enjoy it but just a pain in the patootie with the glasses
user1: I don't think it was an actual 3d movie, just 3d animation based on the introduction. Doesn't sound like you would learn any life lessons from the movie however. Just something to take the kids to. I prefer movies that teach something.
user2: I think Steve Carell was a good choice and yes they should have let people know that.  I enjoy movies that teach something as well.
user1: Especially when its a kids movie. You definitely want something that will teach the kids a life lesson. I've never heard of illumination Entertainment. If this was their debut film they should have put more effort into advertisement.
user2: I agree.  I find it humorous that film companies worry so much about ratings.  I have never worried about that.  If it looks good I watch it.

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: how are you?
user2: I'm ok
user2: Let's talk about the movie
user1: have you hear of despicable?
user1: me
user2: Yes, but I haven't watched it
user2: What is it about?
user1: ok it about computer 3d animal comdy
user2: Is it a movie for kids or adults?
user1: kid
user1: it cartoon
user2: What year was it released in?
user1: 2010
user2: And is it rated well?
user1: it about supervillain steal the great pyramid of giza
user2: That sounds interesting. 
user2: Do you know how long the movie is?
user1: no first rank cgi cartoon
user1: it score 72/81
user1: cast steve carell,jason segel
user1: the girl are in a space craft they stell the moon
user1: the film was animated bu the french animation studio
user1: they said kid dig this movies adult will smile and be amusment
user1: they said it short and sweet and sour and amusing rather than funny.
user1: they said are in are in a orphanage. 
user1: the girl are in orphanage.
user1: it don't sound good to me.
user1: they say Steve carell adoption the girl  
user1: are you their?
user1: it say it rating with the rotten tomatoes 81% and average 6 8/10
user1: it said eventually,gru and the girl arrive at vector's fortress,and gru steals the shrink ray.
user1: the girls then suggest a day at a theme park gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there but instead he warms up to them.

conversation:
user1: Are you there?
user2: Hi, yes I'm here
user1: How are you doing today?
user1: Hello?
user2: I'm in a good mood! I just finished watching an animation movie that made me have a good laugh, Despicable Me. Do you like 3D cartoon comedy movies?
user1: Yes I do they are actually my favourite.
user1: Very entertaining.
user2: Awesome! I think it's a really great movie, but I don't understand why the average rating on Rotten Tomatoes would be 6.8/10. What do you think of the rating?
user1: Me too i would give it like a 9.
user2: I agree. Also I loved Steve Carell as Gru. Did you?
user1: Yes i do.
user1: I can't wait to see it again as soon as i have some free time to spae.
user1: spare.
user2: Well I hope you will enjoy it a second time! I have Pharrell's song stuck in my head right now 
user1: I can imagine.
user1: I see we share the same thoughts.
user2: We do :) anyway I love the scene when Gru decides to steal the moon because he is so disheartened that some other supervillain stole the Great Pyramid of Giza
user1: Yeah i enjoy that part too.
user1: I wonder if there is gonna be another episode? what do yo think?
user2: It's so comical that there is a Bank of Evil for supervillains
user1: Yes that's my opinion too.
user2: I am not sure about there being another episode, but did you know that it was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud as their feature debut film? Wow, I guess you need a really good story and some courage to debut with such a movie
user1: Yeah great movie.
user2: Oh there's another thing I love about this movie by the way, which is the conflict in the heart of the villain. The scene in which Dr. Nefario decides to send the girls back to the orphanage because Gru's mission is more important really broke my heart, even though there's a happy ending
user1: Yeah that was very touching for me too but i always like movies with happy endings.
user2: Me too! Do you usually watch movies with good ratings or do you also watch movies with bad ratings at times?
user1: both but i prefer good ratings.
user2: Yeah I agree... Do you generally like animation movies or do you prefer other movie genres?
user1: love annimated moves.
user1: makes me feel like a kid again.
user2: Same... and I always disagree when they tell me they're just for kids and not adults. some of them even have very complicated plots, for example I could never invent a story in which the Moon gets shrinked and stolen and then it starts to expand again inside the ship of the villain... you need a lot of imagination even for an adult
user1: Yes that's so true.
user2: And yet the critical response for this movie hasn't been great, I mean, it was judged as just likeable
user1: Yeah everyone see's things differently, but i believe that it is an awesome movie.
user2: Some of the responses said it was funny, some said it did not have a real impact. I believe it is actually great for both kids and adults.
user2: thanks for chatting about this with me! hope you'll watch it again soon!
user1: Sure you too.

conversation:
user2: X
user2: Did you know that Steve Carell plays gru?
user1: Yes. I also think it's always a great movie when both critics and movie goers agree on the quality of a movie.
user2: I think so too and it’s a good family movie and a good movie for people of all ages not just for kids 
user1: Agreed. I think it's neat that three well known actors voice the main characters of the movie.
user2: yes and the fact that they are in some way a type of comedic actor and can diversely play many different roles Becca’s Ethel are so well trained and experienced that they know how to play each type of role they are cast into 
user2: *because they are so well trained 
user2: Plus Pixar helped cremate the film and show how well their animators are good at using animated cgi and animation in general 
user1: Very true. I think that might give the adults a good portion of entertainment knowing that the voices they hear are actors that they've enjoyed in PG13 and up movies. 
user1: Pixar is great, that name resonates quality to me.
user2: Yes me too because I grew up with Pixar and I love the company and the storyline and plot for the movie is really good and funny too and it’s one that takes something like a bad villian(gru) and turns it into a good happy ending and the minions are something everyone can choose to like or not like but a majority of people love the minions along with the movie as a whole and the fact that there are 2 more movies that came out after this movie shows the fact that Pixar is doing something right because people love the minion movies 
user2: Plus it got an 81% on rotten tomatoes which is a pretty high score and a pretty good one at that aspect too 
user1: 81% is a great score on rotten tomatoes, especially for a movie geared towards kids. Pixar definitely does a tremendous job creating movies people love. 
user2: Yes I think so too

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hi
user1: We have Despicable Me, which is a pretty funny animated movie with steve carrel as he main character

conversation:
user1: Despicable Me is an animated movie with great review scores!
user2: I really like Steve Carell.  He did a great job with the voice, I thought.
user1: I thought so as well! This movie is great for adults and children too.
user2: Exactly.  The song by Pharrell was pretty catchy too.
user1: I hope Illumination Entertainment continues to produce more films of this quality.
user2: I agree.  I hope Sergio Pablos writes more animated movies also.
user1: I generally prefer Pixar, but I do agree with the critical responses that this was a very good movie.
user2: I liked that this was a 3-D cartoon.  I wish more animated movies were 3-D.
user1: I have motion sickness issues so 3D really isn't that great for me. I do love animated movies though.
user2: It's nice to be able to watch a movie with your kids and be able to enjoy it, like this one.
user1: I apologize, but I am slightly confused as my 2nd document is totally blank.
user2: I think the new part is up at the top of the new page.  It mentions Gru being upset that a new supervillain steals the Great Pyramid.
user2: sorry, top of the first page, not the new page.
user1: Silly me, there it is! What do you think of Gru's plan? I thought it was a little silly, shrinking the moon and all.
user2: Definitely silly, but good for kids
user1: I do understand why the 'Bank of Evil' would want to make sure he had the shrink ray before loaning him any money though.
user2: The minions really stole the show though I thought.
user1: I am not sure about that, other than the fact that they get laid off by Gru (as he can no longer pay them).
user2: True.  The part about the girls being returned to the orphanage was a little sad.
user1: I won't lie I totally cried during this movie. I was happy when he adopted them.
user2: Were you surprised when it was revealed that Vector was Perkins' son?
user1: Yes I was! It's a shame that Gru's possession of the shrink ray caused Vector to leap into action.
user2: Yes, it was, but it was sweet for the girls to offer their piggy bank to help Gru.
user1: I was surprised when Vector kidnapped the girls.
user2: Yes! And I really didn't like it that he took off with the girls rather than honor their deal?
user1: Not cool! Good thing Dr. Nefario discovered the shrink ray effects are only temporary.
user2: That mid-air rescue was pretty intense with the moon exploding out of Vector's ship.
user1: I was so happy when Vector was trapped after the moon went back into orbit.
user2: Me too!  He completely deserved it.

conversation:
user2: I just watched this great movie Despicable Me.
user2: It's this well reviewed movie where the main character is actually a villain. 
user1: I also just watched the film recently. 
user2: Oh, what did you think of it?
user1: I really like how the supervillain is at the forefront but it wasnt a dark movie it kept me laughing.
user1: What did you think of the animation?
user2: Yeah I liked that about the villian as well, I thought the animation wasn't the best Pixar has done but it was definately up there.
user1: The 3D was nice, but I agree about the quality of the animation. 
user2: Yeah the 3D was a neat feature.
user1: Pixar made the movie for the kids, but its a film that adults could enjoy and sit through. 
user2: Oh, definately I love how they do that with their movies!
user2: I think my favorite charactor out of the whole movie was Dr. Nefario. How about you?
user1: I liked Dr. Nefario,  but I think my favorite character was Victor Perkins
user1: What did you think of the music? I think the songs by Pharrell were perfect for the movie.
user2: I agree!
user2: I loved how they used the song to interact with the plot. 
user1: The minions characters also added a lot to the film. 
user2: Yeah they offered up quite a bit of quick-witted humor.
user1: It was a nice twist when Gru plans to leave the girls, but then he doesn't when he  becomes closer.
user2: Yeah, I like how the whole movie is really about him turning into a good guy.
user1: What do you think about Steve Carell playing Gru? I think it was an excellent choice for the character.
user2: Yes, I thought him being the main actor in this movie led to a lot of the punch lines in this movie.
user1: I was surprised when the girls offered their piggy bank to Gru. 
user2: Yeah that was really hear warming. I also thought it was interesting to watch Gru's development as he struggled between villian and dad.
user1: Absolutely. This is displayed especially when Gru had to rescue the girls in mid air. 
user2: Yes I agree, do you think the reviews accurately described the quality of the movie.
user1: Yes i think its pretty accurate from details of the scenes to the amusement of the film.
user2: I concur.
user1: Is there anything you would change about the film ratings listed from Rotten Tomatoes ?
user2: I would make it a little higher, but overall those kinds of scores tend to be lower so it makes sense.
user1: I agree with that. 

conversation:
user1: HI, there!  I'm looking for a movie to see -- or one to avoid! -- do you have any thougths?
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me? 
user1: I haven't! Who's in it? Who directed it?
user2: Pierre Colffin and Chris Renaud are the directors.  Steve, Carrell, Jason Segel and Russel Brand
user1: Hmmmm.  Steve Carrell and Russell Brand are interesting. What's it about?
user2: It's a computer-animated comedy. Has a super villain archenemy, and a scientist
user1: Hmmmm....I don't generally like those. Anything especially interesting in the general plot line?
user2: Not that I am aware of. It's a debut film from Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment. Probably just a good cartoon is what it looks like.
user1: Well, it could be interesting. What were the reviews like?
user2: The reviews were good, laughs and funny, kids and adults.  So looks like it is good for all ages.
user1: Any other info on the plot?
user2: A supervillian is sad when another supervillian steals the Great Pyramid of Giza (he had been thinking of doing that).  The supervillian then decides to steal the moon. Then a rivalry starts between the two
user1: That sounds fun! I love the idea of stealing the Great Pyramid. I wonder where you stash that thing! The moon, too.  I love the moon. Anything else?
user2: Looks like Gru, the main character refers to himself by Gru,  I always think that's funny when they do that. 
user1: I often refer to myself as Gru. I can identify. What is the supervillan's name?
user2: Gru is the supervillan and Vector is his archenemy
user1: Ah!  Gru is the bad guy, then. Vector, the scientist of course, is the good guy. What does he aim to do to recover the pyramids and prevent the theft of the moon?
user2: Gru steals a shrink ray to get money for a loan. Looks like some little kids are involved and Gru starts to have feelings for them.  They are from an orphanage.  Then we have the battle of good vs. evil internally- watch the kids at a recital or steal the moon.
user1: Oh, yes, well, that's always a good angle. Still, doesn't often get the chance to steal the moon, so those kids must have been a real draw! I take it he goes to the orphanage? Is Vector watching all this?
user2: No but he is told about everything going on so he knows Gru's feelings.
user1: And do they end up getting together in the end and teaming up?
user2: I'm not sure. 
user1: Any other details that might make me want to watch the movie?
user2: There is a daring mid air rescue on the girls. Could be some suspense.
user1: Sounds like it. Which girls are these?
user2: The little kids from the orphanage
user1: Oh, I didn't realize they were all girls. Who was rescuing them? Had Gru kidnapped them?
user2: No. Gru was the one who had the girls and Vector kidnapped them.  Sorry so confusing. 
user1: Oh, it is confusing! I thought Vector was the good guy, but he kidnapped the girls? Did Gru take them from the orphanage originally?
user2: I think Gru is the bad guy turned good- he wanted to get the girls from the orphange.  Then Vector is the bad villain. 
user1: I see! Any word about the ending?
user2: I believe the bad villian- Vector is launched into outer space. 

conversation:
user1: Have you seen this movie before?
user1: It's a awesome kids movie! My kids loved it and thought it was super funny!
user2: Of course I have seen Despicable me produced in 2010. have you?
user1: Yes!!
user2: My favorite character was Steve Carell as Gru
user1: Mine to!! Just comical and funny
user2: He does great voice overs for CGI cartoons
user2: Do you usually like 3D animations?
user1: It looks like it scored pretty high with the produces! That good. It was very well put together
user1: I don't usually but I watch them because of my kids. Most turn out to be pretty good!
user2: I think kids liked this movie beccause of the minions and how short the movie run time was
user1: One of the critics feel that the views would need to "learn something" from the movie but I feel it was just for comedy! Only for laughs 
user1: Right! And the minions were so cute lol
user2: Did you like Brand as Dr. Nefario?
user1: I think he played his part very well especially his voice lol. It fit perfectly 
user2: I thought his voice was great for it but hes not a great actor, Brand should stick with comedy
user2: Have you seen other movies by Illumination Entertainment?
user1: True but maybe he was doing something for the kids. 
user1: Doing something different.
user2: They are the leaders in CGI cartoons
user1: The Cinema Scare is a A! ALL the kids begged their parents to see it lol
user1: Very true!
user2: I thought it was cute how his adoptive girls won Grus heart over
user2: Too funny how When Dr. Nefario steals the pyramid of giza 
user1: Ikr! So cute! And you don't see a lot of POSITIVE adoption movies. So maybe it did have a underlying message
user1: Ikr! I even laughed at that. And the stink ray lol
user2: How believable was that Giza Pyramid lol
user2: I thought it was sweet when he gave the girls the shrunken moon
user1: Not at all! But it did make for a very funny moment in the movie lol My kids even wanted to look everything us that he was stealing lol.
user1: Very. Made me want to cry lol a little
user2: I cant believe that it got only a 6.8/10 on rotten tomatoes i would have rated it much higher
user1: Big strong man melted at those little girls

conversation:
user2: Hi.
user1: Hello 
user1: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user2: I want to watch the movie
user1: It's really good!
user2: Yes I have watched Despicable Me 1 and 2
user1: Awesome :) Me too! I loved them. 
user1: Despicable Me is rated pretty highly
user1: 81% on Rotten Tomatos and 72/100 Metacritic
user2: Yeah they were very funny and intriguing. I liked gruu's kids mostly
user1: Totally. they're adorable characters
user2: Yeah rotten tomatoes is usually hard to get high ratings
user1: Exactly! Says a lot for this movie 
user2: Yeah gru's kids are very cute, you just wanna watch them and enjoy their funny moments
user1: aw yeah! They really liven up the story. It's already a cool story line with Dr. Gru wanting to shrink and steal the  moon, and the kids liven it  up. 
user2: Yeah 81% is very high on rotten tomatoes and 72/100 on metacritic is great. It is definitely worth recommending to friends or family,
user1: oh absolutely
user1: The voice actors are great choices too!
user2: Yeah and the Minions!! the minions!!! They always kill it. They deserve a show on their own.
user1: Aw yeah I totally agree! Like the penguins from madagascar got a show. Why not the minions?
user2: Yeah I agree on the voice characters they seem to be well vetted and chosen.
user1: For sure
user1: steve carell is wonderful :D
user1: I love the part at the theme park!
user2: Yeah, why not the crazy and many minions. They always crack me up, and they seem to be superhuman, they never die, no matter what happens to them.
user1: yeah right? they always return to normal haha
user2: Yeah steve carell, he is the voice of Gru if I'm not mistaken. Yeah it's unique, I could not have pegged him to have such a voice.
user1: yes he is Gru! I agree. Unexpected but very good.
user2: Gru is funny, who could come up with a plan of shrinking the moon and stealing it?
user1: Right? And succeeding!
user1: Like, he successfully shrinks and steals the moon
user1: though it does provide an opportunity for the girls to get kidnapped by Dr. nefario haha
user2: Oh, I don't even remember whether he managed to steal it. Thanks for that info.
user1: yeah for sure
user2: The show is just wacky and hilarious with a nice twist of adventure and espionage. I just loved watching it.
user1: totally!  it's so well written
user2: I hope more shows with that kind of uniqueness and wackiness continue to come up.
user2: I feel like going to watch it again.

user2: No I didnt but i think it would have added to the movie 
user2: My sister gets migranes too but she usually gets them from food 
user1: Probably! Especially the scenes with the moon and the space ship
user1: they are definitely no fun!
user2: do you typically watch animated movies?

user1: kids movies are more entertaining lol

user2: so true 
user2: or feel good after watching the movie 
user2: i always feel childlike after watching an animated movie 
user1: me too!
user2: I didnt realize Jason Segel was victor in the movie I think he is so funny 
user1: I like to not have to worry about what my kids will see or hear too. Though we still watch all movies first before they see them, just to be safe
user1: right? 
user1: and if you dont know its Steve Carell as Gru you couldnt tell!
user2: better safe than sorry! a scary movie can be really traumatic for a kid 
user1: exactly!
user1: and lately you never know. even with kids movies. its sad
user2: Yeah I really like Steve Carell 
user1: me too
user1: I liked the movie he did with Anne Hathaway

conversation:
user1: hi htere
user2: Have you seen despicable me?
user2: The first one that was released in 2010?
user1: I have.  funny movie.  My kids love the minions.  you?
user1: yes, the first one.
user2: The minions are awesome arent they but i think steve carell as gru was best
user2: he did a great supervillian as gru 
user2: was this the first 3d animation that your kids saw?
user1: it's been so long.  i'd love to see it again.  i don't recall many of he details.  what's your favorite scene?
user2: Have you seen other films produced by Illumination enertainment?
user1: no my ids are in their teens so they have seen several 3d movies
user1: illumination entertainment?  it wasn't Disney or Universal?  i guess i he never paid attention
user2: i think my favorite scene was when the pyramids were stolen :D
user1: lol!  i remember that one.  
user2: or when he decided to adopt all three girls awwww
user1: cute.  
user2: is this the first CGI cartoon that you have seen from pixar?
user1: Pixar...  probably not.  Pixar is Disney now right?
user1: i've seen several animated movies....
user2: Rotten tomatoes actually gave this movie 6.8/10 can you imagine i would think itd be higher for kids at least
user1: i would think so too
user2: i think russell brand as Dr. Nefario was an excellent choice too
user1: i think it is pretty cool that they do so much wth characters that really don't speak words.
user1: yes he is funny.  
user2: He did a wonderful job stealing the show as a villain lol 
user1: agree
user2: I think it was awesome how gru shrunk and put the moon back for the girls
user1: i'll definintely have to watch this movie again.  the kids would enjoy it again too
user2: right its the one that started minionmania lol
user1: it sure was.
user1: wasn't there like a short film that minions were in and all went from there?
user1: i could be wrong
user2: I think jason segel as vector was great too
user1: thanks

user1: After he stole the Pyramid of Giza he tried to steal the moon.
user2: Does he end up stealing the moon? 
user1: Oh wait I am sorry, somebody else, his rival stole the pyramid. He gets mad and goes to steal the moon.
user1: Well he has to get a shrink ray first.
user2: Does he use the shrink ray to shrink the moon? 
user2: Isn't despicable me with the yellow minion characters? 
user1: Yes those awful things.
user1: We really needed more commemorative cups
user2: They are probably the characters that make the movie funny
user1: Well he does steal the moon.
user2: And then what happens?
user1: Eventually the moon starts going back to it's normal size and it explodes.
user2: Does it affect the earth?!
user1: No it seems to be alright.

user2: yes they are
user1: Have you seen the movie, though?
user2: in bits
user2: oh yes the earlier versions

user2: super duper cute
user2: I love gru
user1: Same here, Steve Carell did a great job voicing him

user1: Lol I can understand that
user2: i play the game with my 1 year old son and he loves it
user2: especially when they are fighting
user1: That's great that it's bringing you together with your son
user2: :)

user2: yes i agree 
user2: the one in the document, what part is it?
user2: part 1 or 2
user2: because I think its in different parts
user1: Part 1 I think
user2: oh ok

user2: yea..hahaha time flies
user1: It has an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes too
user1: That's not too bad
user2: not too bad
user2: our conversation is ended
user1: Well cool, thanks for talking to me about this movie

user2: cheers

conversation:
user2: Hey. What movie are we going to be talking about?
user1: I'm not sure, I can't see the document
user2: haha, awesome. I can't either.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hey. hows it going?
user2: good, and you?
user1: not too bad. ready for the weekend
user2: still got a ways to go
user1: yep. sadly
user2: well if you don't have anything to do or have time, you should watch Despicable Me
user1: Oh yeah? why is that? 
user1: what kind of movie is it?
user2: It's an animated movie that both children and adults can enjoy
user1: I currently don't have any children. What makes it enjoyable for adults?
user2: it has funny punch lines and humor that adults will get
user1: nice. 
user1: i'm not a HUGE fan of animated movies, but i might give it a shot
user2: I hope it will make you smile and laugh at least once
user2: critics have said that it's "fresh and smart for adults."
user1: thats good
user1: can you compare it to another animated movie?
user2: I really don't know, I would say it's the first of it's kind.
user2: I would rank it with Dreamworks, Pixar, Disney animated movies
user1: which studio made descicable me?
user2: it's the debut film from Illumination Entertainment
user1: I've never heard of that studio
user1: based on what you've told me i think i'll go check it out
user2: awesome, I think you will enjoy it
user2: it's got Steve Carell in it
user2: that's a funny guy
user1: is he a voice of a main character? 
user1: i really like him
user2: yes, he is
user1: nice
user1: i definitely look forward to that
user2: Jason Segel and Russell Brand are in it too
user1: even better
user1: i'm going to go right now and download it from Amazon
user2: that's a great idea
user1: awesome. thanks for your advice!
user1: have a good day!

conversation:
user1: So despicable me has been out for about 8 years now. 
user1: Has some amazing ratings, cinemascore A, metacritic 72/100, rottom tomatoes 81%, Steve Carell is my favorite. 
user2: wow, time flies, I can't believe it's been 8 years
user1: Interesting that the title is based on how Steve Carell, aka Gru, refers to himself in the show. Critics think it is a good movie for kids and adults. 
user2: I didn't know that about the tite, either
user2: most animated movies nowadays can be appreciated by adults as well
user2: after all, parents have to sit through the movie with their kids as well
user1: I know, I enjoy how the movie is described as short, sweet and sour and amusing.
user2: I didn't realize it was a French animation company
user1: I did not realize that either, that is a fun fact to share
user1: The director Pierre Coffin did an excellent job collabing with chris renaud 
user2: it seems some of the critics were taking a jab at it, with their comments on how Pixar is "inspiring the midlist"
user1: Sometimes critics can be blinded, I wish they would try to understand more first
user2: what do you mean? 
user2: do you feel the critics reviewed the movie unfairly? 
user1: Understand that this is a flip on normal movies, usually villians take over but they did the opposite, they had the villian be the star
user2: from the description it doesn't sound like the villian follows a different story trajectory than most heroes in other movies
user2: he has a mission. he has a challenge to overcome, he has a rival. the only thing is he is on the "bad guy's" side from the beginning
user1: That is true as well. All in all it was an animation I can enjoy, animation is one of my favorite generes
user1: I think one of the more interesting parts was when the pyramid of giza got stolen
user2: that was the part that set it all off, no? 
user1: indeed it was, it then prompte gru to steal the moon
user2: funny how the villian who stole the pyramid ended up being the son of the man at the Bank of Evil
user2: do you think backing a loan to another villian qualifies as a "conflict of interest" for him? 
user1: I do believe it would. I felt so sad when the day of the moon stealing conflicted with the ballet recital
user2: I know, what will Gru do? 
user1: It says he rushes back but the girls have been kidnapped, what a heart racing turn of events!
user2: yeah, he should have been there to protect the girls
user2: it looks like he gets them back though
user2: and Vector gets trapped on the moon
user1: i do agree, i wish he learned his lesson first 
user2: how funny
user2: Gru seems pretty sweet for a supervillian
user1: i think he may be misunderstood, i think he is someone i could befriend
user2: do you think his part in the story follows that of the traditional hero? 

conversation:
user1: hello have you seen despicable me
user1: The original one from 2010?
user1: Its a great CGI that was produced by Illumination entertainment
user1: Have you seen any of their other movies?
user1: Rotten tomatoes gave despicable me, the minion movie only 6.8/10 i cant believe that i thought it was much better than that
user2: hi 
user2: yes 
user2: this is one of my favorite movie
user2: i saw all of its part Despicable me 1,2,3 
user1: Gru was a great villian but i liked russell brand as dr. nefario much better supervillian
user2: i love Agnes character 
user2: i just like agnes in it 
user1: I thought she was great too, especially when gru decided to adopt all three girls
user1: Have you seen any other 3D cartoons?
user2: never saw such an innocent character ever before
user2: yes 
user1: Pixar did a great job helping to produce this CGI
user2: that was 'INSIDE OUT' movie 
user2: yes 
user1: I think my favorite part was when gru shrunk the moon for the girls
user2: Pixar CGI are always been remarkable
user2: i saw recent part of Despicable me in cenima 
user1: when dr., nefario stole the pyramids from gru hahaha that was a great part of the movie too
user2: with my husband :p
user2: he likes Gru but i like Agnes 
user1: did you know that even though cinema score gave this movie an A, metacritic only gave it 72/100
user2: and i use to mimic her dialouges 
user1: They even had a bank of evil in this movie do you remember it? 
user2: when she says "pretty please" and "what about good night kisses and stories "
user1: thats where gru gets the loan to steal the moon because it would cost so much to do it
user2: yes yes 
user1: Jason Segal as the voice of Vector was amazing too 
user1: Thats who gru steals the shrink ray from
user2: and in the last moon grew again bigger in its original condition
user1: is vector hes the one with the shrink ray needed to shrink the moon
user2: all concepts of movie are soo funny
user1: i think the directors did a great job working together to get this produced, coffin and renaud
user2: do you remember when Agnes scream , her scream can break all glasses
user1: they produced a lot of the animation for this movie in france
user2: ahan
user2: you there ?

user2: i have seen parts of it
user2: whats the storyline?
user1: Its about an evil villain who end up with kids and slowly turns good because of them
user2: what does the document say about the reviews?
user1: One review says "Since villains so often steal the show in animation, Despicable Me smartly turns the wholeoperation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru."
user2: any ratings based on stars or percentages?
user1: Rotten tomatoes gives it a 6.8/10
user2: do you think a 30 year old man would watch this by himself
user1: Probably not
user2: why not?

user1: I think so. Its a good family movie
user2: have you seen it?
user1: Yes I have multiple times
user2: i know they made a bunch of sequels so it must be popular

user1: Yeah everybody still loves those movies. The first one is still one of my favorite kids movies
user1: You should. Its a really cute movie
user2: i remember the Disney cartoons like lion king but toy story changed everything
user1: Yes it did. I cried like a baby when I watched the last one 
user1: I grew up with toy story and my daughter loves it too

user1: Oh, I really like Steve Carrell

user1: Yes
user2: Yeah, not only for children but its a movie definetely worth watching with the rest of the family
user1: How were the critics responses?
user2: and it has pretty good critic responces one of the best is´´Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whisplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D´´
user2: and then the rest are also positive
user1: That sounds great. What is the plot about?
user2: another interesting point is that it has a CinemaScore of A
user2: the plot is about a supervillain (Gru) that is very mean at first
user2: he then adopts three girls that change his life and he becomes a better person
user2: and a hero actually
user1: Cool
user1: That is interesting
user2: Yeah!
user2: it is pretty interesting
user2: watch it!
user2: you wont regret it
user1: I am interested in this movie, thanks!

user1: the villain does steal the moon, but the orphans get kidnapped

user2: awww
user2: sounds like a good family movie

user1: and i think we're done.  : )
user2: :)

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hello
user1: Seen any good movies lately?
user1: Seen Despicable Me?
user2: Yes, have you see it?
user1: Yeah, I liked it\
user1: It wasn't as deep as other animated
user2: did you know that Steve Carell played Gru?
user1: I don't think I did
user1: I like Russell Brand
user2: I liked that they made Gru a "good" bad guy
user1: that was weird
user1: 'cause there wasn't really a bad guy
user1: an antagonist
user1: or was there?
user2: I would consider Vector the antagonist
user1: don't remember Vector
user1: was this before Disney bought Pixar?
user2: he was Gru's archenemy. he was the one that stole the pyramid
user1: seen too many movies
user1: did this one have the little yellow creatures?
user2: yes the minions assisted Gru with his plan to steal the moon
user1: I remember the moon stealing stuff
user1: minions, yeah
user1: Wall-E is my favorite animated movie. you?
user2: I haven't seen that one. 
user1: it's awesome
user1: its' deep
user1: funny, cute, sad
user1: I also liked the one about all the emotions in the girl's head
user2: I don't think I saw that one either.do you agree with what the critics said about Despicable me? 
user1: I don't remember it well enough
user1: I remember liking it
user1: But not loving it
user2: it appears it was mostly positive reviews, I think I would agree with that. Especially the part about it being entertaining for kids and adults 
user1: yeah but most animated movies today can claim that
user2: that's true too
user2: what did you think about Gru adopting the girls?
user1: it's almost a requirement
user1: i remember the girls
user1: i think i remember thinking the movie was sweet and cute
user1: I think I got kind of tired of the minions too soon
user2: it was sweet. I liked that Gru had a soft spot for the girls. 
user2: the minions i think were a bit irrelevant to the plot
user1: hmm

conversation:
user1: Hello! How are you?
user2: Good. You need to watch the animated movie "Despicable Me."
user1: oh yeah? Why is that?
user2: It's got Steve Carell, Jasin Segel and Russell Brand in it. It's computer animated. Hilarious.
user1: Steve Carell is good. It must be a comedy if he is in it. How would you rate the film out of 10?
user2: 10
user1: Why?
user2: It's funny as heck.
user1: Well hows the story? If there is one.
user1: Also what did critics give it in terms of score?
user2: The story is about a megalomaniacal supervillian who ends up with three little girls. Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 81%, Metacritic gave it 72/100 and CinemaScore gave it an A.
user1: Oh so it seems to be a pretty decent watch.
user1: How did you like the story?
user2: I loved it. Good to smoke weed and laugh at.\
user1: Hopefully I don't need to by high to enjoy the movie.
user2: No but if you are it makes it even better.
user1: Who was your favorite character?
user2: Gru, the supervillian.
user1: That must be Steve's character right?
user2: Yes.
user1: This sounds like a movie I might check out. You said he got 3 little girls. Are these his kids?
user2: No, they end up getting adopted by him at the end. He's evil, I don't think he even ever had a girlfriend.
user1: Adopted huh? That's interesting considering he's supposed to be a super villain. I am assuming I can watch this with the wife and kids right?
user2: Yeah, it's a kid's movie. Cartoon.
user2: Steve Carell's character tries to steal the Moon in the movie.
user1: This sounds good for them, and yo say the comedy is enough to keep me interested.
user1: Lol he tried to break the fourth wall?
user1: I think the kids would like that part the most.
user2: There's a bit of fourth wall breakage in the film.
user1: Who directed the film? Do you know?
user2: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.
user1: Interesting, I'll give this a watch. Thanks a lot
user2: Of course!
user1: Have a good day
user2: I can't leave until the study is done.
user1: It should be. Does the Finish Conversation button have a white or grey tint?
user2: White.
user1: Should be white.

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello
user2: have you seen movie Despicable Me
user1: Have you Despicable Me on the cinemas? I did and it was hilarious. Gru is the best villain ever.
user2: A man who delights in all things wicked, supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) hatches a plan to steal the moon. 
user2: Surrounded by an army of little yellow minions and his impenetrable arsenal of weapons and war machines, Gru makes ready to vanquish all who stand in his way.
user1: Exactly. Universal animations are amazing. In this one the conflict between Gru and Victor Vector are really nice.
user2: yes
user1: Have you seen it on 3D? I did and it really was worth waiting for the tickets. 
user2: no
user2: Despicable Me is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated comedy film from Universal Pictures and Illumination 
user1: Dr Nefario is also hilarious with his science experiments, don't you think?
user2: yes
user1: That scene that Great Pyramid of Giza is stolen is really impressive right?
user1: Also the idea that Gru would take a loan on Bank of Evil to steel the moon is also really funny. 
user1: So did you liked the minions?
user2: yes
user2: how was your experience

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hi
user1: so have you seen despicable me?
user2: i have not
user1: my son loves it
user2: have you?
user1: yes too many times actually lol
user2: is it good?
user1: if you like comedy cartoons then yes
user2: i like steve carell
user1: yea hes one of the voices
user2: all i know is that its the movie with the minions in it
user1: the villian gru, is funny and steals things, like he stole a pyramid, then he goes to steal the moon
user1: the minions are his companions and help him in his evil acts
user1: he starts a rivalry with another villian and they compete to have control of the moon
user2: that sounds interesting
user1: he uses a shrink ray gun to capture the moon then the other villian steals it from him but he doesnt know there is a time limit on the shrink ray so it grows back to full size after a bit
user1: yea the little minions kinda steal the show which is why they made a couple spin off movies of them but really the movie is focused around gru, the super villian
user2: i just noticed russel brand is in this too
user1: yea he has a voice part but its pretty small
user1: mostly steve carell, and i think the minions voices are done by computer
user2: yea its pretty much gibberish right?
user1: for the most part yea every now and then you may make out a word
user1: and the evil villian adopts 3 girls and they interfere with his villiantry but hes attached to them so he tries to balance both
user2: does your son like the scene at the theme park?
user1: yea somewhat, its pretty small compared to the movie as a whole
user1: he really likes the minions more than anything
user2: i can imagine its like a scene where gru starts becoming good or empathetic or something like that
user2: so this is the end you were talking about
user1: right
user2: is there like a moral at the end of the movie?
user1: the opponent kidnaps the girls
user1: then he hands over the moon to get the girls back
user1: the moon grows back to full size
user2: does vector die or is that too much for a kids movie?
user1: i dont believe it shows him dying
user1: prolly too much for a kids movie
user1: just launches him out into space
user1: anywho, nice talkto to you
user2: nice talking to you too

conversation:
user1: have you heard of despicable me?
user1: it was surprisingly good for dreamworks
user2: I have heard of despicable me. I haven't seen it yet though.
user1: You must have seen the minions though
user2: I didn't. I always wanted to. There are so many reference people make to those movies.
user1: I know, I see them everywhere still. you must see pictures of minions on facebook though
user2: I have seen picture on Facebook. I actually saw a person dressed up as a Minion in Las Vegas.
user1: haha wow
user1: they're the funniest part, the kid characters are really good too
user2: It was a female minion. She was awesome. Yeah, the minions I have seen clips of in ADs, etc and they are hilarious.
user1: have you watched the office?
user2: I have seen some of the Office. Not a lot though.
user2: The english version correct? Not the british?
user1: the American, the main character is voiced by Steve Carrel who played Michael on the office
user2: Right, yeah, I love him!
user1: He's really funny in it
user2: I bet, he is funny in everything.
user2: I have seen other Dreamworks films too, so I imagine I would like it.
user1: I think it's one of Dreamworks best, it's the same quality as pixar
user1: sequels are kind of meh
user2: Pixar is amazing at what they do. Dreamworks is incredible as well. 
user2: I loved some others like Wall-E, Meet The Robinsons, etc
user1: definitely, I think everyones catching up to each other
user2: They do such a great job with character building and making the audience attach.
user1: Inside out was great too
user2: Not to mention the emotions...
user2: I haven't seen Inside Out, that was the emotion one right?
user2: I did just watch Emojii movie. Which was decent.
user1: Agreed, I wish there was that style of animation on tv, yep, it's really really good
user1: haven't seen that one
user2: I loved the marketing for Inside Out.
user2: Not too much, Not too little.
user1: didn't give away the whole plot
user1: can't stand when they give away the whole story and the twists
user2: Right!

conversation:
user1: What did you think of Steve Carrell as Gru?
user2: I think he did a great job. He took a regular villain and turned him into someone you could root for.
user2: What did you think of Dr. Nefario?
user1: I love Russell Brand so I found him hilarious.
user1: Do you agree it was a good movie for both kids and adults?
user2: I was honestly surprised when I found out Russell Brand did the voice for him.
user2: I really do. I enjoyed it and I know the kids I know loved it too.
user1: I agree. I think the reviews were spot-on.
user2: What did you think of the animation style?
user1: I thought it was really interesting. Maybe not as good as Pixar, but still enjoyable.
user1: What did you think about the scene where the Great Pyramid was stolen?
user2: I honestly thought it was a pretty good gag and it really set up Gru's character to me. 
user1: I could see that. But I thought it was just a bit far-fetched. The whole shrink ray setup did not really appeal to me.
user1: Did you like the transition to trying to steal the moon?
user2: Me either. Who really needs a shrink ray?
user1: I guess it woudn't be the first time it's used in animated films, but it's still kind of a cliche.
user2: I did like the transition and I have to agree with you about the shrink ray. There was a series of movies in the 90's dedicated to one lol
user1: Did you like Margo, Edith, and Agnes?
user2: I did actually. Agnes was my favorite.
user2: Did you like the girls?
user1: Yeah, she was quite funny. I liked them too.
user1: The whole ballet recital setup was silly though.
user2: I felt bad for them when they were taken back to the orphanage
user1: Yeah, it was kind of sad.
user2: Oh yeah, That was just a bit heavy handed
user2: What was your opinions on the minions?
user1: They really helped make the rescue possible. I thought they were a cool inclusion.
user1: Did you like that the shrink ray affects were only temporary?
user2: It made sense in the plot, but otherwise not really. 
user2: That just makes a terrible shrink ray
user1: Yeah, it seemed contrived.
user1: Did you like that Vector as trapped on the moon?
user2: How did you feel about the 2 villains interactions>
user1: I thought it was pretty funny.
user2: I think it was fitting. He got what he wanted. The moon haha
user2: I thought it was too! That was some of the best parts
user1: Yeah, like they say, to the moon.
user1: Did you think the rotten tomatoes score was fair?
user2: I think so. I know there probably was some backlash after over saturation of the minions
user1: Yeah, that makes sense. I do think the fact that it was enjoyable for both kids and adults is a huge plus.
user2: A big one.
user2: Parents like movies they can watch with their kids
user1: Yeah, otherwise it's intolerable.
user1: Have you seen other films by Pierre Coffin/Chris Renaud?
user2: Yeah. The other sequels and the one with the pets. They were all pretty good
user1: Oh, I haven't seen them. Anyways, it was good talking to you.

conversation:
user2: You should watch Despicable Me if you haven't. It was actually made by a French animation studio that was acquired by Illumination Entertainment, which is cool. It was Illumination's debut film.
user1: what is it about?
user2: It is about a rogue villain who is a megalomaniac but ultimately very likable. Also has a great song by Pharrell.
user1: who are some of the other characters?
user2: Jason Segel plays Vector, the nemesis of the main character. The main character (Gru) also has an elderly gadget man named Dr. Nefario  who I didn't realize until now is voiced by Russell Brand lol
user1: what are some of the best scenes of the movie?
user2: I don't have any info about specific scenes in front of me. 
user1: ok. when was the movie made?
user2: 2010 (same year my oldest kid was born. Crazy!)
user1: Lol. that's cool. Is it a pg 13 movie?
user2: Sorry man my second page just does not want to load even if I open it in a new window (I'm pretty sure it's PG but not sure if I'm allowed to reveal that)
user1: Lol ok. what do we do now?
user2: I'm trying to launch it again but if you have more questions you're supposed to ask... I'm not supposed to use outside information but I HAVE seen that movie about 25 times. My boys are 4 and 7. :)
user1: me too. I have 4 kids lol. just trying to follow the instructions. don't know what else to ask lol
user2: Better think of something 
user1: who is the director
user2: Oh shit it loaded
user2: Oh wait nope just resized apparently
user2: OK now I see key scenes lol
user2: OK directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud
user1: what are the best scenes of the movie?
user2: Key scenes include Gru stealing a shrink ray, Gru's daughters inspiring him to keep going without funding, and eventually going against Vector to see who can steal the moon (How old are your kids?)
user1: 17 15 12 7 
user2: :)
user1: lol yea teenager years 
user1: who produced the movie?
user2: I don't see a producer listed
user1: how much did it gross?
user2: no idea
user1: lol I really don't have nothing to ask. 
user1: the main questions have been answered 
user2: Lying instructions said it would automatically move on by now
user1: you can finish now. I see it. have a great day
user2: I don't see it

conversation:
user1: Hello, the movie is Despicable me, it's and animation movie.
user2: Hello dear
user2: Oh 
user1: Rotten tomatoes is 81% and 6.8/10
user1: It's a popular movie with the kids, I think adults as well.
user2: that is a good rating actually
user2: you mean kids do like animation right?
user1: Do you know Steve Carell, he plays the voice of Gru.
user1: yes!
user1: He's the mean supervillian
user2: I never heard that name before now
user1: Really? It's so popular !
user2: who directed the movie?
user1: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud
user2: What thrilled you about the movie
user1: There's a fight between two super villians
user2: or let me say what do you like about it?
user1: Stealing of something important
user1: I like that it's mainly about the bad guys
user2: and what would that be ?
user1: The Great Pyramid of Giza
user1: Have you heard of Minions?
user1: They help Gru, they're little yellow guys.
user2: yeah minions? the little creatures
user1: yes, they are a part of the movie
user1: they go on a mission to get the stolen goods back
user2: you mean the minions?
user1: Yes and Gru
user1: They use a shrink ray
user2: so were they successful?
user1: Yes, they steal the moon
user2: Anyway I know you are not much of a good story teller
user2: but let me ask, would you reccommend i see the movie?
user1: ok?
user1: Yes, it's funny and cute
user2: maybe we can hang out next time it is viewing in the movies
user2: but do you agree with the ratings?

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user1: Have you ever seen this movie?
user2: I found it amusing. The oversaturation of the minions notwithstanding. 
user2: Yes. It's been heavily looped on cable, and my dad likes it, so
user1: I have seen it multiple times as well since my kids love it
user1: The rating on these seem off
user1: what do you think?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes is a tough crowd, and even so that's a high score from there. 
user1: I agree, that is one of the higher scores I have seen
user1: I think the responses are not that critcal
user1: :)
user2: Kids stuff is rarely put to heavy scrutiny. it's a bonus if it's not boring for adults or insulting pandering to children (Lego movies, I'm looking at you) 
user2: To be sure, there was a loooot of merchandising with the minions once this took off, but at least it wasn't a 90 minute commercial. :)
user1: I agree, my kids wanted all the minion toys possible
user2: I cannot see a yellow rounded thing without seeing a minion face anymore. They're cute but my goodness, there are limits.
user1: Can you really say that Gru and Victor have a rivalry in the movie?
user2: I *Just* realized Vector's name is a joke, because vector graphic images can be resized, and he had a shrink ray! Aah! 
user1: It was really short lived and I liked it most when gru froze his head
user1: lol...i did not realize that
user2: But nah, I don't see any direct competition really? It was clearly just a device to move the plot
user1: I loved when they want to the amusement park and he blew up the stand...one of the best parts of the movie
user1: also, why not rob a bank to get funding for the project?  They are bad guys
user2: Who doesn't want to blow up a rigged carnival game? 
user2: And good point! I wonder if you lose your account at Bank of Evil if you rob another bank... maybe there's an arrangement...
user2: Also, who named these girls? 
user1: just don't rob us is the arrangement
user2: Possible..
user1: they were adopted so I can imagine someone wanted them to suffer with those names
user1: weird how the moon blew up in size and at the end was still far away from the earth
user2: I know the hipsters are trying to bring back classic names, but some of them die off for a reason.
user2: i can't recall if they showed the tides going off without the moon but that should've been in there.
user1: i remember the wolf howling and then stopped
user1: and i think he turned back into a man
user2: Ah, yes. 

conversation:
user1: The movie has a great cast! It sounds really well made given all the high end actors.
user2: Steve Carrell was hilarious and super evil in this movie
user1: He was hilarious! I am a huge fan of Russell Brand so I really enjoyed his character. I agree with the critic who said that the movie is fresh and smart for adults.
user2: Yes! I can't believe it was the feature film debut for Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. What an incredible movie to have as your first!
user1: Illumination Entertainment definitely made a good decision to acquire the Mac Guff animation studio after this film!
user2: I hope they come out with some other 3D films and get more stars to do the theme songs in the future. It was really cool to hear Pharrell singing the theme song.
user1: Yes having big stars do the opening song really sets a film up for success from the start.
user2: Do you like 3D animated movies usually?
user1: When they are done well, yes. I prefer 3D movies that make you feel as though you are there as opposed to feeling like things are coming out at you. How about you?
user2: Me too! Especially when they are funny and quirky like Despicable Me
user1: What a well written story line! Some animated movies focus more on the animation and less on the actual plot.
user2: It got so exciting from the start when Gru got angry about the Great Pyramid being stolen and then decided to get back by stealing the Moon!
user1: It was bound to be good when supervillians are trying to one up each other! What do you think about kids watching movies about supervillans though? Most animation is geared towards children
user2: I think it was a smart choice. Villians always steal the show in animation.
user1: True, however, stealing isn't necessarily a good thing for children to be watching.
user2: LOL. Well there is also the friendly scientist and the minions for them to watch. 
user1: The girls were so sweet to offer up their piggy bank!  
user2: I can't believe Gru wanted to send them back to the orphanage
user2: Are you still there?
user2: Did someone use a shrink ray on your keyboard?
user2: Hmmmm
user2: Where are you?
user2: We're almost done! LOL
user2: Ughh

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi how are you
user1: I'm doing pretty good how about you?
user2: Doing good now that I have someone to talk with about this movie! How did you like Despicable Me?
user1: I think it was a pretty good movie overall. The critics rate it fairly high though. Do you think it got a fair score on Rotten Tomatoes?
user2: I'm not a fan of rotten tomatoes, they don't seem to give good movies proper credit. However I would say the score was fair enough. I think I would of gave it  a 6 too.
user1: Yeah that's probably where I'd put it. It was good but not amazing haha. How did you like Steve Carell voicing Gru?
user2: I love Steve Carell. I think he was a pretty good fit for the voice, especially considering this was a comedy. How did you like the animations?
user1: I liked him too, he was a great choice for the character. The animation was really good, not too cartoony but just enough, if that makes sense. How about you?
user2: I think it was pretty good. I really don't like 3d animated movies at all, but this one was different. It was pretty enjoyable. I agree with the not too cartoony aspect you said.
user2: What would you say you enjoyed mos about the film?
user1: Do you usually like animated movies?
user2: Not at all.
user2: Most of theme are way too goofy.
user1: I like watching cartoons and animated movies a lot. The plot of Despicable Me was kind of out there for me though, I know they were trying to overplay the evil villain plot but it was a little out there for me. I did like the minions and the girls tho.
user2: Yes, the minions by far where my favorite part of the film.
user2: I watch cartoons as well, but for some reason 3d animation just doesn't feel the same
user1: Yeah it does have a totally different feel to it. I thought it was clever that Gru had to get funding for his evil plan from the Bank of Evil
user2: Yeah, at least we know how it works on the evil villain side of things.
user2: How was the quality of jokes to you?
user2: I thought they were pretty solid for the kids and adults.
user1: They were alright, not great but good for everyone to laugh at I think. How did you like the personalities of the three girls?
user2: I think they where pretty typical overall. Nothing that hasn't been seen before, but the rest of the movie was able to distract me from that fact.
user1: I think they were pretty stereotypical to their roles right? Kind of exactly what you'd expect. They were sweet tho. 
user2: yeah, exactly but they are pretty likable characters overall. 
user2: I think the plot was a bit bad, but I've come to expect it from animation movies
user2: In fact, I think that is why I really don't pick up on these kinds of films. Simply because I know the plot will be lacking.
user1: I feel like they could have made them a little more relate able. Yeah the first time I saw it I really enjoyed it, I liked the soundtrack a lot. The second time I saw it I was not as pleased with the movie but still liked the music.
user2: Yeah, now that you mention it the music was pretty good.
user2: It's pretty up there on my list of most liked soundtracks.
user1: They really milked everything out of the minions since they were such a big hit after the movie though.
user2: I think they where the best part of the film, you couldn't help but laugh at every little thing that they did. I don't blame them at all for trying to milk them for all they are worth.
user1: My kids have never seen Despicable Me or any of the following movies but know what minions are. I agree they really added a lot to the movie. They were really fun. Would you say the minions were your favorite character in the movie?
user2: Yes, 100 percent without even thinking about it. I can recall almost every joke the minions said or did as opposed to the actual characters.
user1: That's awesome. I just vaguely remember any of the movie honestly. What was your favorite scene? Or favorite joke?
user2: what about you? who was your favorite ccharacter?
user1: I'd say the minions were my favorite too. And Gru's dogs thing lol
user2: Lol yeah the dogs where cool.
user2: I htink one scene I liked was when the girls were asking for pizza and one of the minions was with them
user2: the way he said "OOOO Stuffed crust" just made me laugh out loud.
user1: Awesome, thanks for chatting we can finish the conversation now! Take care.
user2: See you@

user2: It's about a supervillian named Gru, and his nemesis Victor Perkins
user1: Tell me what makes it sound like you would want to see it?
user2: Well, I love superhero comedies, so there's one thing
user2: And it's also a Disney film, so it's pretty much bound to be good
user1: So it is going to funny that is good. i need a good laugh
user2: And it turns the villian trope on its head, so it's also going to be unexpected
user1: Disney films are always lighthearted
user2: Usually, yes!
user1: So twists and turn. Leaves you until the end to try to guess the ending
user2: Yep! But also a lot of the 'usual' things aren't quite what they seem either, so even when you think you know what's going on, you don't!
user1: So based on the review you read will you go see it
user2: Yep!
user2: It sounds adorable
user1: I think I will give it a go and see how it is also.
user2: Excellent!
user2: Do you enjoy comedies in general?
user1: I do. Romantic comedies mostly but this will be good 
user2: Yeah, there's no romance here, but plenty of familial fluff
user1: Since you like superhero movies this should fill you up as well.
user2: Yep! Even if there are no heroes
user2: Well
user2: Unless you count the girls
user1: At least I wont have to cover my eyes and ears. Lol
user1: No heros? There has to be a hero.
user2: Gru, the villain and the protagonist, might count as the hero?
user1: Does it sound like one of the girls are going to be a huge character in this movie
user2: But it's mostly his growing relationship with the daughters he adopts
user1: Gru is a funny name
user2: It is! Suitable for a Disney villain, though
user1: So he was a bachelor and he gets to have a family that is cool
user2: Yep!
user1: I agree.
user2: I mean, he already had the minions
user2: And they tried but they're not very effective at, well, anything
user1: Yes but they weren't seen as a family.
user1: So does he fight the other antagonist?
user2: Sort of?
user2: There's a long chase scene including rocket ships
user1: hMMM
user2: but it's mostly focused on rescuing the girls from his nemesis
user1: Did he build a rocketship or steal one?
user2: Both!
user1: Lol. Figures
user2: He builds his own, but his nemesis steals it, so he steals his nemesis' rocketship in turn
user2: It's all very exciting
user1: Ahh. He gets a turnaround of circumstances. I love hearing the bad guy loses. 
user2: Stranded on the moon, without his rocketship, just his astronaut suit
user1: It makes me happy to hear the villian does a turn around and turns somewhat good by adopting the girls.
user1: Better than his birthday suit. 
user2: Yep!
user2: I mean, it is a disney movie
user2: Aimed at kids
user1: Sorry I couldn't resist it. I don't do racy movies but it popped in my head. I am glad I could take the kids and leave them for a few minutes and know nothing racy would happen.
user2: Nope, nothing even mildly spicy
user2: It's very exciting, of course, but I would absolutely take a small child to see it and not be worried about it
user1: Are the minions different colors?
user2: Nope! They're all yellow, but they have different sorts of hair and number of eyes and height and so on
user2: So they're visually a unit but also recognizable solo
user1: Different personalities?
user2: Yep!
user1: What do the minions Do?
user2: Attempt to be useful and fail hilariously, mostly
user2: They live up to their title
user1: Are there lots of minions?
user2: So many
user2: Eight or nine specific ones? But dozens and dozens and dozens
user1: Wow that is a lot of personalities and to think he wanted to add girls to the mix.
user2: I can't spoil everything!
user1: Yes you can.
user1: I still want to see it. 
user1: It sounds delightful.
user2: It is delightful! Go into it with some mystery, you'll enjoy it more!
user1: What age group do you think is appropriate for this movie?
user2: Five and up
user2: It's a little complex for under five
user1: To a very old adult?
user2: Yep!
user1: Cool
user1: Does the rocket explode?
user2: No, they just steal it
user1: And are the girls young or teenagers.
user2: Young
user1: They stole it from the other guy that was holding the girls hostage?
user2: The oldest is eleven, I think? The youngest is seven or eight
user2: Yep!
user1: How did Gru meet the girls.
user1: Have you seen it yet?
user2: I have!
user2: He sees them selling cookies and has a wonderful, fiendish idea!
user1: I always mean to watch certain things and then can't decide if its worth it or not.
user2: Which turns out to not be quite so fiendish 
user2: I think it is!
user1: Girls and cookie what could go wrong.
user2: It's an adorable, heartwarming story of found family, matched with supervillian hijinks

conversation:
user2: How did you like the movie?
user1: I thought it was pretty good. I typically go more for Pixar movies, so I was a little surprised at how enjoyable I found this one.
user2: Yes i enjoyed how the villan was the main character and then turned good. 
user1: Yeah I think having a grouch like that for the main character was a nice change for animated movies.
user2: Steven tajat played Gru did amazing
user2: Steve that played Gru did amazing!
user1: Do you watch a lot of animated movies?
user2: I do. Animated comedy is my favorite. How about you?
user1: I really like all kinds of movies, and tend to go toward anything with good critic responses. That's why I checked this one out.
user1: Did you know anything about this movie before watching it?
user2: I agee. I see it has a huge famous cast
user2: I noticed that in the movie even when the villain was being grumpy you can see his heart becoming soft
user1: I like how they focus on some silly, mundane aspects of being a supervillain, like needing to get a loan from the Bank of Evil.
user2: I liked when him and the girls went and rode the roller coaster in the movie! He also 1 prizes for the little girls when they couldn't I thought that was very sweet.
user1: It was funny to see villains combating with each other to see who could be the best villain.
user2: Did ypu agree with the ratings it got?
user1: The metacritic score seems about right to me. I might have gone a little bit lower, just because I think other animated movies set the bar really high.
user2: I was very pleased with a high rating. One of the best i had seen in awhile.
user2: I do feel it shpuld have included the minons more
user2:  Since it was there break put movie. 
user1: I liked the sweet storyline of the girls warming up Gru's heart, I just didn't think it was as emotionally rewarding as some other movies.
user1: The minions were definitely scene stealers.
user2: They did a good job at making them super cute yet super funny as well.
user1: Their light-hearted cuteness might have made it a little hard for the movie to get to my emotions more at the heartfelt scenes.
user1: I think it was just a tiny bit more for kids than for families/everyone like some other animated movies have been.
user2: I must say it was my 1st 3d movie and it was fun seeing the minons in 3d and I do agree with the emotional aspect you voiced
user2: It makes me curious to find out the fate of all the characters and invest my time to this movie
user1: The moon getting larger in the ship was a great visual gag.
user2: Haha yes it was. I loved when the girls made the cute puns 
user2: And how the girl beds were rocket bombs 
user1: Do you usually check out critic reviews before picking a movie to watch, or how do you decide?
user2: I honestly do not. However i like to afterwards to see if we have the same thoughts on the movie.
user2: What do you check 0ut in a movie before you watch it?
user1: I tend to side more with critics than audiences so I like having an idea of what the critics thought first. I also like to know who wrote and directed it, I think that's very important.
user2: Awesome well thanks for the chat. Have a great day. I enjoyed our talk

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hello
user1: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user2: yes , one of my favourites
user2: did you know who were the directors of  despicable me 2010?
user1: Really?  Tell me about it please.
user1: I think its Pierre?
user2: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renauld were the directors of this great animation
user2: yes that's right
user1: Oh cool!  
user1: Is it a kids movie?
user1: Ive heard of it but never seen it.... 
user1: Should I see it?
user2: it's mostly a kids movie but also very entertaining for grown ups 
user2: you should watch it especially if you are feeling bored 
user1: That's good because I usually only watch kid movies with my daughter.
user2: it's a 3D computer animated comedy
user2: yes I also watched it with my children
user1: What's it about?
user2: Gru , the main character is a super villain was angry when another one stole the great pyramid of Giza
user1: Oh cool that sounds entertaining and fun!
user2: and his colleague helped him to steal the moon in a very weird way to beat the other villian
user1: Haha!  How long is the movie?
user2: it is a smart movie because it turns villians show in to a very entertaining new show
user2: I am not sure actually, but it's an average long movie
user1: Oh Im not sure if that will work for my daughter.  
user2: well the critics responded that adults and children will have fun with amusement and no one will be unhappy while watching it
user2: it is very fun for kids and smart for adults
user2: do you generally watch movies with good ratings?
user1: Yes I enjoy those
user2: well, it's average rating on Rotten Tomatoes was 81%
user1: Thats pretty good!
user2: and CinemaScore was A
user1: Wow amazing!!  
user1: Ive got to see it!
user1: Is Chris Renaud also a good director you think?
user2: he is very good indeed 
user1: Also the cast looks pretty good too!
user1: Russell Brand is a good actor and his voice and that accent!  I love it!

conversation:
user1: Hi!  Have you seen Steve Carell's movie Despicable Me?
user2: No I have not, What is it?
user1: It's an animated film about a supervillian... it got very high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Who is the supervillian?
user1: Steve Carell plays the supervillian called Gru.  It also stars the voices of Jason Segel and Russell Brand
user2: I like movies with russell brand, Who does he voice?
user1: He voices Dr. Nefario who is a friendly sort of scientist gadget guy
user2: Wow! so what does Gru and this scientist do? whjat is the plot?
user1: I only know that those people were in it and that it was animated by a French animation studio... I was hoping you had more info, HA!  I do know that critics say that kids and adults both will enjoy it!
user2: Well that is awesome!  Im gonna guess that since Gru is the main character that  he refers himself as Despicable Me, the title. Since he is a villain.
user2: Do you know why Gru ks a villain, what does he do that makes him abad guy?
user1: Well, I do know that the supervilliain is apparently trying to 'one-up' another supervilliain by shrinking and stealing the Moon... 
user2: Another supervillian wants the moon? how awful...lol..who is this other character?
user1: Um, no, I think the other character has pulled off another similar action... shrinking and stealing the Great Pyramid at Giza.
user2: well dang, maybe the second bad dude is the top villain. So how does Gru pull off stealing the moon all by himself?
user1: It is somehow about Gru attempting to get the financing for his big scheme and how he makes a rival out of the other guy which turns out to be Vector, the character voiced by Jason Segal
user1: He ends up having to steal a shrink ray in order to get the money
user2: ok so vector is the other bad guy. why doesnt Gru just go to a bank and get a loan?
user2: Or ask some friends for the money?
user1: He tried to I guess, but the condition was that he steal the ray to get the moneyh... 
user1: Also there are some little girls that he becomes attached to and it complcates his feelings over it
user2: ok. SO I was just going to ask if he had any family that could help him. what are the girls names and how many?
user1: I'm not sure the girls names or such... but he does get quite attached, especially when they do things like offer their piggy banks to help him with money... 
user1: Wait.. their name might be Margo, Edith and Agnes
user2: Pretty names. And sweet girls to offer up their own money for him, they must love one another.
user2: So does Gru get the moon or does the other guy?
user1: I know he really warms up to them over the course of the film.  He does successfully shrink and steal the Moon.  But it gets very complicated because the girls get kidnapped. He has to surrender it to Vector...
user1: The plot thickens when Dr Nefario figures out that the shrink ray effect is only temporary.
user2: So Gru gives the moon to Vector to save the girls, thats deep. Does Vector give the girls back?
user1: He reneges on the deal... but then the 'good' guys do a rescue attempt as the Moon expands back to it's original size.
user2: Conversation can be done, it was nice chatting with you about Despicable me. Have a great day!
user1: You too!

user1: I saw this movie a long time ago
user1: You must watch it, it's funny
user1: Especially with Steve Carell as Gru

user1: It's animated and the story is a comedy about Gru the mean supervillain and his rivalry with Victor
user1: It is suitable for adults and kids
user2: Oh, is it an action movie?
user1: Well, not really
user1: it's more like a comedy

conversation:
user1: Have you ever seen despicable me?
user2: I have, have you?
user1: Nope!
user1: I saw the mcdonalds toys and commercials tho
user2: It's super cute
user2: It has a pretty high rating online on different review sites
user1: cute? Was it a fun movie or did it just look good
user2: It's fun to look at and it's a feel good movie. Something the whole family would enjoy
user1: Was it like a corny love story like they do in movies now?
user2: I don't think I would describe it as corny
user1: oh it was a cute love story then :D
user1: I'll have to go see the movie
user2: Yeah, steve carrell is great as the main villan in the movie, Gru
user1: Steve is always good in movies
user2: For sure, he's an impeccable actor 
user1: Is this the movie with minions
user2: Yes it is
user2: Do you enjoy animated films?
user1: Crazy how those got populat
user1: popular
user1: I thought they were dumb, but the kids like em
user2: It's interesting that the main story has little to do with minions but they've become a huge part of the film
user1: So does the bad guy win in the end????
user2: Maybe more like the bad guy truly learns what love is and isn't really so bad
user2: :)
user1: Funny how movies like this for kids teach love like that
user2: Yeah, its all about how to go from being mean to being loving, but I wonder if that really absorbs children in
user2: it must though!
user1: maybe. idk, like I said I didn't see it. It sounds cool by whats on the left
user2: It's worth a watch
user1: I just might

conversation:
user1: Do you like animation movies?
user2: Not all animation movies, but I liked this one. Have you seen it?
user1: I liked this one too! It received an "A" on Cinemascore and 81% on Rotten Tomatoes. I have to agree with those critic websites.
user1: Do you agree with the rating of this movie?
user2: This 3d computer animation was awesome! I think i would have rated it higher
user1: Nice! I also thought Steve Carell as Gru, the supervillain was very funny.
user2: Is this the first animation you have seen with the collaboration between the directors coffin & renaud?
user1: Yes, it is the only movie I have seen by these directors.
user1: I wonder how the French animation studio may have influenced the overall aesthetic or direction of the film.
user2: The Gru was one of my favorite characters too however I think Dr. Nefario's character was better
user1: I also liked Dr. Nefario's character. Russell Brand did a great job.
user2: I think that since this movie is short it makes it easier for kids to like it. 
user1: I agree! I think that where the film lacks in CGI, it makes up for in its amusement, quick laughs, and funny punch lines
user2: I think how they animated the super villains in despicable me made them lovable and helped them steal the show
user1: Definitely! It was also funny how Gru stole the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is not realistic but very laughable.
user2: I cant believe this debuted almost 8 years ago already it seems like it was only recently
user2: the minions in this 3d animation remind me of oompa loompas lol 
user1: Certainly! What did you think adults would think of the movie versus kids?
user1: The movie hit a high point when Gru stole the shrink ray.
user2: I think adults were able to get the under lying jokes that kids did not but that they liked it because of the minions and the small play time of the movie. 
user1: I agree!
user2: have you seen any other of pixars CGI cartoons?
user1: I am not sure. But I did like the CGI during the scene where Gru sells parts of his lair to construct the spacecraft.
user2: They did an awesome job with the CGI on this movie much better than CGI i have seen from pixar in the past
user1: Interesting! What do you think about when Gru shrinks and steals the moon? I thought it was a funny scene and out of this world.
user2: Oh wow I forgot there was three girls, I thought it was only one.
user1: Yeah there were three girls! I can't count all of the minions there were though.
user2: I think its sweet how they show how the girls melt his heart n turn him into a big softy
user2: Lots and lots of minions is what made this movie A rated

conversation:
user1: Hey hows it going?
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: No, is it any good?
user2: Rotten tomatoes gives it an 81$ fresh rating.  Do you like Steve Carell?
user1: I do like Steve Carell, he can be very funny.
user2: Sorry that was a typo.  81%
user1: 81%? Wow that is great!
user2: Carell plays a character name Gru - a mean super villain.
user1: Oh, is it a superhero movie?
user2: It's an American 3D computer-animated comedy
user1: oh wow, I had no idea! What else is it abouot?
user2: Gru steals the Great Pyramid of Giza with some help by his Minions.
user2: He has a rivalry with another villain named Vector
user1: what? That sounds crazy!
user1: dang, Vector is an evil name for sure.
user2: A review says that it's a "comedy of whiplash-quick laughs"
user1: Sounds right up my ally then! 
user2: Gru eventually gets some girls to help him out against Vector
user2: They steal a shrink ray
user1: A shrink ray! Dastardly!
user1: but so convenient
user2: Somewhere along the story he loses his confidence and tells his minion that he can no longer pay their services.  The girls overhear and offer  to give him everything in their piggy bank
user1: awwww, so kind
user2: That act inspires gru to build a spacehip to steal the moon
user1: The MOON?!?!? He is very ambitious
user2: But the day he's planning to do this is the same day as the girls' ballet recital
user1: oh dear, isnt that always the way? Dance recital or moon stealing.....
user2: yes tough decision.  he opts to steal the moon and try to rush back to the recital
user1: thanks for talking!

conversation:
user2: Hi, this is one of my favorite movies!!
user1: It looks like a good movie
user1: It gets pretty good ratings
user2: Have you not seen it? I love animated movies, are you familiar with the minions? They are the comic relief in the movie.
user1: I think I saw most of it once on tv
user1: I wouldnt go to a movie theater to see this movie
user2: Aw it was really funny, alot of the humor was aimed at adults even though it was a kids movie.
user1: I dont think I will go out of my way to see this movie
user2: Ok, well I recommend this movie, what is the genre you prefer?
user1: I would prefer action or drama something real
user2: Oh, yeah you lost me there. I have taken niece and nephew and friends to see these movies, htere is humor in them for anyone.
user1: I don't like to many newer movies made for kids they always have alot of cheesy comedy
user2: Yeah they do, but I have a zany sense of humor. The whole franchise starting with this movie is very humorous, the animation is great. I love Steve Carell and he plays the main character.
user1: this is a franchise they made more of these movies?
user2: Yes, Despicable Me 2 &3, and also Minions, love those guys.
user1: People will watch anything these days
user2: Well aren't you a ray of sunshine? Trying to discuss this movie, which is the point to this conversation. I chose the movie because it was one I liked. Obviously you have no kids
user1: I have a kid nice that you would assume otherwise because I dont like the one kid movie you choosed
user2: Yes, like I said I am discussing this movie. I didn't realize that Russell Brand was a voice in this movie til I just read it
user1: I am more of a Jason segel fan out of the three characters they have mentioned
user1: Is there any females in this cast
user1: How does one steal the great pyramid of giza ?
user2: I do like Jason Siegal also, though I can't think of any other movies of his. Well, you're going to hate this. The Supervillan has a shrink ray. The pyramid was stolen and is replaced by a bouncy pyramid.
user1: So what are they going to replace the moon with when they shrink it a block of cheese?
user2: Not at all they were stealing it to hold it for ransom, because super villans had fallen on hard times like everyone else.
user2: Was that 12??
user1: Looks like they need a better shrink ray the on from honey i shrunk the kids might work
user2: Ha funny,... Never saw that movie
user1: So what happens after the moon returns to normal
user2: Nothing the bad guys are stuck on it
user1: Is that how the movie ends 

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user2: hello 
user2: i personally loved this movie and thought steve carell was great in it
user1: I agree
user1: What did you think of Jason Segel?
user1: Do you like animation movies?
user2: LOL ... i loved him too ... but gru really made the movie for me.  Steve really gave him a lot of personality
user2: I think it was the fact that even though it was animation it was all the adult inuendo that made me laugh 
user1: Definitely
user1: There is a good mix of adult and kid things to keep everyone happy
user1: Just like the last reviewer says
user2: wish i had seen the 3D version i bet that would have been incredible really
user1: Yeah, I didn't see the 3D version either
user1: Typically 3D doesn't impress me very much
user2: i can't see in 3D i am blind in one eye LOL.  This movie was a feather in Pixar's cap for sure
user1: Definitely, I think the ratings are pretty accurate except for Metacritic, that seems low
user2: i don't even know what that one means ... but i can't believe rotten tomatoes only gave it 81% not that it isn't a good rating i understand 
user1: I'd never heard of this director before
user2:  me either but then i am not very saavy with names ... of directors
user2: i didn't know russell brand was dr nefario either
user1: That's pretty funny that Gru wanted to abandon the girls at the amusement park.
user2: that was pretty funny ... and in the end he ended up with his face pained .... 
user1: Yep, that was nice that he warmed up to the girls.
user1: And then they offered up their own money to help him out, how sweet.
user1: What did you think of Dr. Nefario arranging for the girls to be returned to the orphanage?
user2: i was cracking up when gru thought to impress Mr Perkins by shrinking one of the minions 
user1: And it was even more impressive that he actually shrunk the moon.
user2: i was so mad at dr nefario .... ugh ... but then i guess you had to have someone to get angry with in the movie 
user1: Too bad he had to give it to Vector!
user1: There must be some sort of disagreement to move the plot along...
user2: yes but so funny when it enlarged in his ship and was like a giant marble rolling around 
user1: Talk about causing problems!
user1: It's a good thing the Minions came to the rescue
user2: it was awesome the way gru saved the girls on his lil "tight rope" and then you are right the way they came to the rescue when gru had to catch the last girl ... i'm a sucker for a sappy save
user1: Def!
user1: It didn't end well for Vector
user2: no it sure didn't but you have to admit his squid gun was pretty inventive
user2: and his pet shark was pretty cool
user1: Squid launcher
user1: Gotta reload
user1: Too funny
user2: and he had another gun too ... piranha wasn't it ? 
user1: Ah, yeah, I think so
user1: Still not as good as Gru's Freeze Ray
user2: and Mr Perkins being his dad LOL .. that took the cake ... and watching him shrink the bathroom fixtures was hysterical .. of all the rooms to shrink things in ... 
user1: Curse you tiny toilet
user2: that is so true ... the freeze ray is funny as heck
user1: Good talking with you
user2: nice chatting with you also ... i loved the pink space suit and the recital at the end ...
user2: i can't believe we are done already LOL .. have a great day
user1: you too

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: hello
user2: have you seen despicable me? 
user1: ohh I sure have! Its a great movie! I have seen the second one as well.
user2: did you know The titlereferences the main character as he refers to himself, and is accompanied by a song by Pharrell.
user1: no I did not
user2: yeah its totally true!
user1: what other fun facts do you know?
user2: The film was animated by the French animation studioMac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination Entertainment.[6] It was directed by PierreCoffin and Chris Renaud as their feature debut film, with a story by Sergio Pablos.
user1: oh wow, you really know your stuff
user2: let me tell you a little more about what happens in the movie since you have seen it and I wont spoil anything
user1: alright, sounds good.
user2: Gru, a supervillain, is disheartened when an unknown supervillain steals the Great Pyramidof Giza. Gru, with the assistance of his colleague Dr. Nefario and his Minions, resolves toone-up this mystery rival by shrinking and stealing the Moon.
user1: right, thats a main key story plot
user2: As it would be costly to stealthe moon, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Bank president Mr. Perkins is impressedby the plan but will provide the money only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first.Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain named Vector was responsible for the pyramidtheft, Gru starts a rivalry with him.
user1: hehe its like im watching the movie all over again almost
user2: Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals the shrink ray. Thegirls then suggest a day at a theme park; Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girlsthere, but instead he warms up to them. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, statingthat he finally has the shrink ray.
user1: are you going to tell me the whole story? 
user2: ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, andPerkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund hisoperations.

Gru becomes conflicted, and Dr. Nefario, seeing the recital asinterfering with the plan, arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage.

user1: I have definitely used that strategy before! my kids just love anything with minions 
user2: I understand how it goes, both my daughter AND my wife dressed as minions last halloween. 
user1: ohhh haha that is just too funny
user2: well let me continue with the plot. Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon, and rushes back to Earth to attend therecital—only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arrivingat Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flyingoff with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile,

user1: No it launches back into orbit. Doesn't that sound cool?
user2: Amazing, incredible, it's drawing my attention

user2: that is an ingenious idea 
user2: I am now interested in the movie

user1: Russell Brand is always pretty funny also

conversation:
user2: I love how in Despicable Me it turned the villian into the good guy. That was great.
user1: I agree, it was awesome. 
user1: Steve Carrell and Jason Segel are both great, they really made the movie
user2: i thought it was very funny too... it wasn't just a movie for the kids. It was great for adults as well!
user2: Steve Carell played his character very well. It seemed like even though it was a cartoon it was still relatable
user1: Definitely, this is a movie I actually look forward to watching when my kids ask. I wish there were more out there like this that the whole family can enjoy.
user2: I dont mind watching despicable me with my kids at all. I still laugh at it even after seeing it at least a dozen times
user1: Us too, and I just noticed Russell Brand is Dr. Nefario, I never knew that! 
user2: me either. im surprised i didnt know before now. I love russell brand
user1: The Pharrell song was also a huge part of the movie, it went with it so well.
user2: That is so true. Do you agree with the ratings the movie was given?
user1: I dont understand the whole Rotten Tomato scoring system, but I see an "A" and I know that has to be good, so I would agree.

conversation:
user1: That was a great animated movie! I agree with the A CinemaScore. what do you think?
user2: I wan't able to see it yet, what was the title?
user1: Despicable Me
user2: Sounds like an interesting title. And with a great recommendation from you and CinemaScore I think I should check it out. Could you tell me a little about the plot?
user1: Ofcourese, its an animated movie from Pixar with Steve Carell as Gru, a mean supervillain and Jason Segel as Victor Perkins, Gru's archenemy 
user2: That sounds like a fun movie. Would you recommend this movie for kids?
user1: Oh definitely 
user2: Do you know the movies rating?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: I have! I absolutely love it!
user2: Yes, I do too. I can't believe it has been 8 years since it came out!
user1: I only tried to watch it once, but only got 10 mins in before I had to leave lol so...
user1: Is there a document you need to tell me?
user2: Yes, it is about this movie. Do you like Steve Carell? He's pretty funny as Gru.
user1: I do like Steve Carell as an actor. He's one of my favorites lol.
user1: Can you tell me a bit about the movie?
user2: This is a movie that kids and adults love. It was animated by a French animation studio.
user1: Oh really, so it's kid friendly, that's good. What's the synopsis of it?
user2: This is a movie that focuses on the villain Gru, which is different since most movies have the show trying to be stolen by the villain.
user2: Gru has the assistance of his minions and they are trying to steal the moon.
user1: That's a weird plot!
user2: Yeah, it kinda is, lol.
user1: It sounds like a fun movie to set back and watch with the family.
user2: He gets a loan from the Bank of Evil, where the bank president is so impressed by his plan to steal the moon.
user1: Haha, really? I'll have to check it out.
user2: But, he will only give him the money if Gru can get a shrink ray first. I guess he is going to shrink the moon?
user1: It sounds like an interesting plan lol
user1: I would be interesting in watching it.
user1: interested*
user1: Was there anything else I should consider?
user2: He steals a shrink ray.
user1: and shrinks the moon I am assuming.
user2: He comes in contact with a couple girls and they follow him. He tries to get rid of them at a theme park, but instead warms up to the little girls. The girls interrupt his meeting with the bank president and he loses confidence in Gru.
user1: haha, little girls always mess things up :p
user2: But, Gru eventually ends up shrinking and stealing the moon.
user1: s
user1: So I guess the villain wins.
user2: While he was doing this, another villan, Vector, kidnaps the girls. Gru gives over the moon to get the girls, but they soon find out the shrink ray's effects are temporary.
user1: Ohhh so the moon gets put back in it's correct place.
user2: Yes. The moon expands in Vector's ship and launches itself back into orbit.
user1: Oh okay. Well bye.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi there
user1: what movie is it?
user2: Despicable Me
user1:  yea, sure they're kind of cute right? sneaky too.
user2: The minions? Yes, my daughters love them. I definitely think it's a movie that's worth seeing. It's really highly reviewed by both viewers and critics. 
user1: I like their made up language
user1: seem to have a lot of ingenuity too
user2: It is really fun. There's some Spanish in there and some other languages too. And I thought it was really creative as a movie to show a bad guy who ends up becoming a good dad. 
user1: well, yea, he wasn't that bad
user1: considering...
user2: True. But still a "Supervillian" of sorts. 
user2: I really liked the fact that he could get a loan from a bank of evil to help him steal the moon. 
user1: I guess some will loan money to anyone
user2: Yes, but I liked that this was specifically an evil bank as opposed to, you know, the just mundanely evil real banks, lol. 
user1: specifically evil bank, hmm, at least they're not fooling themselves.
user2: I also thought the whole rivalry with Victor over the shrink ray was good. 
user1: I suppose
user2: My kids cried when the girls got sent back to the orphanage. 
user1: that sounds really sad
user2: It was, but it turns out okay. The minions raise money for the rocket and everything and he sests out to steal the moon, but then he remembers he promised to be at their dance recital and makes up with them. 
user1: i like all the futuristic tech
user2: I really did too. The freeze reay is excellent. 
user2: *ray
user1: liking the shrink ray
user2: Yeah, I did too. Have you seen the second one? I thought the tech in that one was really fun. 
user1: no
user1: couple vids
user1: isn't there something about time travel or is that a different one??
user2: Oh well. It's good. And I thought the last-minute rescue and cliffhangers were well done. I don't think it's going to really affect anyones life, but it was cute and funny. 
user2: That is a different one. 
user2: The second one has a supervillian that Gru and his girlfriend are after and the minions turn purple and evil. 
user1: woah
user1: purple minions?
user2: It's really fun! They are more like cave men than the kind of dumb funny minions. 
user1: oic
user2: And of course it introduces the fart gun, lol. 
user1: that's cool
user2: It's a lot of fun. 
user1: I guess some people don't get, but I do
user2: I do too, I really like the sorts of humor the movies use. 
user1: gru still seemed pretty human
user2: I agree. He was a very relatable character, especially when you saw what his mom was like. 
user1: not very supportive is she?
user2: That's an understatement! No, when he's so proud of stuff as a kid she just kind of says "meh"
user2: Anyway, it was good talking to you!

conversation:
user1: The movie to be discussed is Despicable Me
user2: I really like the movie
user2: Its good to watch with kids.
user1: It's actually a cute movie for an animated film.  
user1: Universal Pictures released it in 2010 in the U.S., but it was animated by a French animation studio.
user2: Since villains often steal Despicable Me changes that and puts it into a family friendly movie
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave Despicable Me a rating of 81%
user2: and a Metacritic Score: 72/100
user1: Pharrell had a song on the Despicable Me soundtrack
user2: It was also directed by PierreCoffin and Chris Renaud
user2: Steve Carell as Gru, is a nice fit
user1: The Supervillain, Gru, recruites the help of Dr. Nefario and his team of minions to shrink and steal the moon when an unknown supervillian steals the Great Pyramid
user2: Its an American 3D computer-animated comedy film from Universal Picturesand Illumination Entewas released on July 9, 2010,
user1: Overall, critics advise this movie as entertaining for both children and adults.
user2: Yes and is a great plot about villains changing their lives around and trying to do whats right. 
user1: I agree, this is a valuable lesson for all to learn
user2: I really like the Gru is trying his best to be a dad to the girls
user1: Gru develops caring feelings towards the girls that he once despised and that is a great example of character development 
user2: The movie also helps show that there are single dads in the world and not just moms, which either way is a hard thing but its nice to see a movie showing this.
user1: Yes, I enjoy seeing a male figure being displayed as naturing
user2: I think it can help kids build self worth too and they just because they may have done something bad doesn't mean they cant change and do something that is right.
user1: And even if they make mistakes in the past, it is never too late to turn it around
user2: Its also good for parents to and can keep us entertained just as well as kids because we can realate to some of things that happen in the plot such as 
user2: I really like the plot of the moive 
user1: When Gru comes back from stealing the moon to find Vector has kidnapped the girls, he makes it a priority to get them back which shows he truly does care for them.
user2: Its got excitement to like when Gru steals the shrink ray.
user1: It is jammed packed with excitement the whole way through, especially when the minions come into play with their daring rescue
user1: And the supervillian, Vector, got his just deserves when he was trapped in the ship lost out into space.
user2: I know right its awesome

conversation:
user2: I thought it was a great animated film. What do you think?
user1: I agree! I think the characters are voiced well, especially Steve Carrell as Gru!
user2: That he was. Russel Brand was great too.
user1: I didn't even realize Rusell Branch voiced Dr. Nefario! What a great surprise! Or Jason Segel as Vector. Might have to re-watch the movie because I love Jason Segel. 
user1: I thought the movie was definitely amusing and very original
user2: I agree. I loved how it had something for both kids and adults in it. Makes watching it as a family easier.
user1: Exactly! There was the perfect "sweet-and-sour" blend and the dirty jokes went right over kids heads'!
user1: Do you think Rotten Tomatoes rated it too low?
user2: Pixar has always been really good at that.
user2: No, I think that's a pretty good rating. Anything over 70% usually means it was good.
user2: It wasn't mind blowing or anything. Just good, clean fun.
user1: That's true and I agree with that!
user1: What did you think of the Minions?
user2: They're kind of the secret stars of the movie. Probably why they got their own spin off.
user2: Though they can be over-used sometimes.
user2: You a Pharrell fan?
user1: I agree - they made the movie a lot more enjoyable for me but the entire nation craze after that was excessive. I thougt the Great Pyramids scene was fun. And lol that song probably drove me nuts! 
user2: I think it's interesting this was the directors' first film together.
user2: Usually a team like that is well-established.
user1: Definitely, it came together really well 
user1: I think some of my favorite scenes are when he starts to warm up to the girls
user2: Yeah, it wasn't laugh out loud funny, but I found myself amused throughout.
user2: That was a good scene.
user1: I thought the girls offering their piggy bank was such a sweet and pivotal moment
user2: That was definitely nice. But I'm sorry, I gotta admit, it's all about Pharrell. It's always been about Pharrell.
user1: And the ballet recital being on the same day as he needs to carry-out the plan created a good big of drama.
user1: Hahaha the man who never ages
user2: And that hat. The plot does get a bit crazy towards the end though. Everything is so dense, there's so much going on.
user1: But it's not overwhelming and yup, his hat got its own twitter account
user1: I liked how the shrink ray affect was temporary!
user2: Fortunate, that. It reminded me of the Rick Moranis classic, Honey I Shrunk the Kids.
user1: Oh, I can totally see that! I wonder if they had any inspiration from that
user2: I felt it had some inspiration from movies past. It's strange, but it also had a French feel to it. I was surprised to learn that it was animated by a French studio.
user1: Which critical response do you agree with the most?
user1: Hmm, interesting! I didn't do that much research on the movie!
user2: Metacritic. It's a totally passable movie. Enjoyable, but not ground breaking.
user2: Well, it was great talking with you! Have a good one!

user2: That sounds like a good soundtrack. Does the movie dive into topics such as communism?

user1: On a separate note, Gru seems like a nice guy even though he is a supervillain.
user2: Oh, I thought you meant the soundtrack is fun. I was hoping to hear more about the soundtrack, but that's okay. 
user2: How is the animation for the movie?
user1: It seems top notch.
user1: Universal Studios is a quality corporation when it comes to animation.

user1: It's going well, thanks. So this movie is Despicable Me, starring Steve Carell as a mean supervillain, Gru, and Jason Segel as Victor,  Gru's archenemy.
user1: The movie scored 81% on Rotten Tomatoes and a A on CinemaScore, it's definitely worth watching!
user2: I've heard of that movie, what do you think about it?
user1: I thought it was interesting and fun, and I think the positive ratings reflect that.
user2: I would have to agree.  I've only heard good things about it. My son has watched it, but I haven't. 
user1: It's a great movie for kids and adults alike, and is definitely a worthwhile expenditure! Critics say "Kids will dig it, and adults will smile with amusement"!
user2: Sounds pretty cool! My son talked about it constantly when he first saw it. It definitely going to be on my to do list. 
user2: In your opinion what is the theme of the movie?
user1: I think the movie follow the masterplot of the hero's journey, where the audience follows Gru in his attempt to achieve a long term goal of shrinking the moon. 
user1: What do you think about story's involving the masterplot of the hero's journey?
user2: I think the director of this movie creatively exemplified that there's good in all of us. Although Gru was initially a Supervillian he changed his views and actually became the hero. 
user1: Yes! The way that the plot twist was pulled off by the director was heartwarming. I thought the voice acting by Steve Carell was phenomenal! What are you thoughts on the quality of animation of the film?
user2: The animation was phenomenal. It was unbelievably realistic. And I didn't know Steve Carell play Gru! Now I definitely must see it! Lol
user2: Wow so I'm seeing they actually have parts 2 and three and the success of the movie broke records. I read an article stating Despicable Me is Now the Most Successful Animated Franchise of All Time. Why do you think the movie was so successful relative to other films?
user1: I think a lot of the movie's success came from a combination of excellent actors, animation, and directors. It was also very helpful that anyone across a broad range of ages could be entertained by it!
user1: One of my favourite scenes that I thought was portrayed very well in the film was the scene where Gru runs out of money to pay his little minions, but his girls break open their piggy bank to help pay. I thought the way that the scene was constructed helped convey a very positive message!
user2: Aww. That scene alone contributed to his change of heart. According to the story plot, Gru was evil because he never really had anyone to care for him. Those girls actually saved him as a person. 
user2: I often hear a great deal about the minions. What is their purpose in this movie?
user1: Definitely! I really like the message that you are never too far down the wrong path to come back and make things right. It's a great lesson for young and old people to learn!
user1: In my opinion, the minions in the movie provide a lot of the comic relief that is necessary to keep children and adults engaged.
user2: I have to agree, they seem to be the most popular characters. Allthough nobody actually understands what they are saying, they are quite hilarious. Never a dull moment for sure.
user1: What did you think about the scene where Gru successfully shrinks and steals the moon and Vector kidnaps the girls?
user1: I thought it was really heartwarming when Gru tried to rescue the girls after showing such dislike for them in the beginning of the film.
user2: At first I was actually excited that he was successful, but then I was sad that the girls were gone. I believe that scene alone is the climax and turning point of the movie. Shrinking the moon was important to him, but in the end the girls meant more to him than anything. 
user1: Absolutely! I 100% agree with you.
user1: What are your thoughts on the ending of the film?
user2: I was rooting him on from that point on! Kind of surprised me that he actually became their dad! No everyone get's to say they have a super cool supervillian as a parent! Lol
user1: Yeah true! What would you rate the film out of 10 in your opinion?
user2: Well I guess I know what my next binge watch movie day will consist of :)
user2: I would give it at least an 8. What about you?
user1: I would give it an 8 as well!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: hello
user1: hello
user2: I never saw this movie, it was assigned to me by a computer
user1: are you able to see the text of my messages?
user2: yes I am
user1: excellent
user1: i have seen this movie before!
user2: they want us to chat, but I know nothing about this movie
user1: we are supposed to discuss only based on what we have read from the document supplied to us
user2: lol, I have no clue because I have already forgotten 
user2: well they put up another page...
user1: based on the information given, the movie is an animation and was rated an 81% on rotten tomatoes. personally I enjoy most animated movies and take reviews into consideration, and think i may like this movie
user2: I don't like animated movies too much but I do like the tv shows like ' King of the hill and The Simpsons, etc....
user2: I probably wouldn't watch this one...
user2: I'm sure a lot of kids will enjoy it though
user1: the critical responses are interesting in that it says that kids will dig it and adults will smile with amusement. i don't have children of my own, but would probably watch it with my niece and nephew. i'm not sure that i would have sought this movie out on my own.
user2: Yeah, wwould be good with some young'uns for sure, I just looked at the trailer on youtube
user1: also the cast list looks pretty good, but the key scenes don't sound super great
user2: I agree 100%
user1: The new information about key scene number 2 sounds kind of interesting. It says that the supervillain adopts three girls.
user1: That could be super funny or just a cinematic disaster
user2: lol, yup, and we know good always wins over evil in the movies
user1: Right, and if it's more of a children's movie, then it definitely will happen
user2: yes indeed as it should I guess..............
user1: There we go. It sounds like the supervillain saves the girls, therefore choosing good over evil
user2: page says the animation is not top notch though....but inspiring and fun..
user1: And of course the supervillain is no longer a villain as he surrenders the Moon to his nemesis
user2: Thinking of something more to chat about is the real challenge to this HIT !!
user1: I like the review that says "short, sweet-and-sour." That makes me want to watch it and eat sweet and sour chicken!
user1: That is for sure
user2: lol, well for 2 bucks it might be worth it.....
user1: Agreed
user1: I am also a Steve Carell fan and this movie, from the document, sounds like something I might watch at home...but I wouldn't pay to see it in a theater
user2: I'm in my mid 50's so animation does not do much for me anymore, and I do not have any grand kids as of yet..
user1: That makes sense! I'm in my early 30's and have enjoyed some animated films, but often times by mistake because I watch them with nieces, nephews, etc.
user2: A new Batman animated movie just came out I might be interested in, called Gotham By Gaslight
user1: A lot of my friends have children and will occasionally say, "I know it's for kids, but it's actually a really good movie!"
user2: yeah, I'm sure that happens a lot
user1: That does sound interesting.
user1: I have also seen the Lego Movie and Lego Batman movies. I enjoyed Lego Batman because there were a lot of references for adults who have grown up watching the Batman movies
user2: yeah, I found it one one of the file sharing sites I visit a lot..
user2: lol, Yeah I have watched the Batman Lego movie, it was a hoot !
user1: I did choose to see Lego Batman in theaters with my husband because he was really excited about it. We brought a beer and ate popcorn, and the adults were laughing much more than the children in the theater
user1: I'm wondering if we need to hit the finish conversation button?
user2: lol, sounds like a good time for all !!
user1: I'm going to try it!
user2: maybe so, 
user2: me too

conversation:
user2: hI

user2: DO YOU LIKE THE MOVIE?
user1: I liked it, even though it's more for kids
user2: I haven't seen it before
user1: what sounds best about it to you, based on the document?
user2: I like funny punch lines
user1: me too. I also like that it's in 3D

user2: cool
user1: who sounds like the best character to you?
user2: oh it loaded for me now
user2: idk you?
user1: I'd say Gru, I like villains
user2: ok
user2: "no one will be any different aftward" makes it seem boring
user1: typical story plot
user2: k

conversation:
user1: Have you seen Despicable Me? It's a 2010 animation voiced by Steve Carell, Jason Segal and Russell Brand.
user2: Oh really? I like Steve Carell and Russell Brand. Is it a kid's movie?
user1: It's an animated movie but everyone can enjoy it equally.
user2: Do you know if Jason Sega has been in any other films? I don't think I know him
user1: I'm not sure. All I know is that he's fantastic in Despicable Me. 
user2: What is the movie about?
user1: It's about a megalomanic rogue name Gru. It received a CinemaScore of A.
user2: Megalomanic? What is that?
user1: Kind of like a villain. It's funnyt and sweet all at the same time.
user2: Do you know what studio made the film?
user2: Is it a Disney movie?
user1: Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment made it. It's Illums debut film.
user2: Interesting. Can you tell me the story line?
user1: It was animated by the french animation tudio Mac Guff which Illumination Entertainment bought out.
user1: Gru is the main character. He's a super villain who gets upset when another villain steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. He tries everything he can to steal it back. 
user2: Two villians? Any super heros in this movie?
user1: That's the whole point of the movie! The villain takes the super hero role. It only scored a 6.8/10 on Rotten Tomatoes which I don't agree with at all. 
user1: Steve Carell plays Gru.
user2: Sounds like a really original idea! Can you tell me who does the voice of Gru and the other character names?
user2: You read my mind!!!!
user1: There's even a Pharrell song in it.
user2: Ew LOL. Not a fan. LOL
user1: Are you a Jason Segal fan? He plays Victor "Vector" Perkins.
user2: I am not sure that I know him. Do you know any other films he has done?
user1: Hm, not sure. How about Russell Brand? He plays Dr. Nefario.
user2: I do find Russell Brand funny. Is he funny in this movie?
user1: He's one of the funniest. The movie is a comedy mostly but it's heartwarming at the same time. It's cute.
user2: I am curious about the story line.
user2: Sounds cute
user1: Like I said, Gru is a villian. He witnesses an unknown villain steal something and wants to get it back. Gru has to steal other things and his minions (Dr Nefario) have to make a plan. 

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user2: iH
user1: Did you like the movie Despicable Me?
user2: You know, I kind of did.  Even though its a kids movie.  I get a kick out of the minions
user1: I like the minions too. And yes even though it was a kids movie i liked it as well
user2: And of course Steve Carell is great
user1: Yes he is always a good actor in my eyes. Even in the animated film industry.
user1: Do you normally watch childrens movies or anything of this genre?
user2: Yes, I will often watch Disney movies especially anything like a musical
user1: Same here. Especially pixar, do you like pixar films?
user1: Hello?

conversation:
user1: Hello there.  Have you gotten a chance to see Despicable Me?
user2: yes i have
user1: What did you think, do you agree with the critics that it was great?
user2: I fully agree with the critics, it was funny and enjoyable to watch regardless of age
user2: What did you think of the movie?
user1: I thought it was great.  Steve Carrell really showed his skill.  Made me a huge fan.
user2: I couldn't agree more. It really created a large following for the movie, which is a great sign of  success
user1: I do agree that it animation level wise wasn't on Pixar's level (but who is) but the comedy, and the acting really made up for that, and made it stand out.  Don't you think?
user2: With picking Steve Carrell they found one of the funniest men in comedy and he really did stand out 
user1: I'm not trashing on the other two either.  Jason Segel and Russell Brand also put in great performances.
user2: O not at all, the team of actors Pixar assembled showed off a great combination of their  skills 
user1: it was from Illumination, not Pixar, but it was so great I can see how that mistake could happen!  What did you think of the entire one upsmanship the two supervillains were doing?  I thought it was a great plot.
user2: My bad, it was very funny all throughout. Seemed to prevent the movie from ever getting dry
user1: Yep.  I thought the entire pyramid vs. him deciding to take the moon to show he was better was a hilarious idea.
user2: Easily one of the funniest moment  in the entire movie.  Was a great idea
user1: I also liked how they had  "Bank of evil"  Just little things like that were so goofy.
user2: Everything that could have possibly been serious was made funny.  That helped keep the  kids attention as well as  make it funny for the afults
user2: adults
user1: Yep couldn't agree more.  I liked the twist that the banker was involved with Vector too.  Not so far from the real world!
user2: Things like that made the movie seem far more realistic than it really was. Kinda cool since it was an animated movie for kids 
user1: I also thought it was a little touching, even for such a silly movie where the girls offered their piggy bank.
user2: I was just thinking about that scene. Every time something  evil was going to happen  something always seemed to lighten the mood
user1: Yeah, the pacing was terrific.  I also like that he didn't actually hold the girls to it haha.
user2: Me too, I still can;t get over how much he tries to take over the moon  
user1: What did you think when the girls got kidnapped?  I thought that was dark, even for this type of themed movie.
user2: It was defiantly a first for a movie like this. most like  this have very little dark or mysterious events with them. 
user1: Yep, so I guess pushing the envelope isn't so bad.  The entire karma message at the end was good too, where the fellow gets his comeuppance.
user2: It seemed as though this  movie was already trying to teach  and show examples  about  things like karma throughout the movie. Possibly due to the large amount of kids watching 
user1: Agreed.  I also felt it was really touching when it showed how much Gru had learned to care for the kids.  What did you think?
user2: I thought it was very touching. He always kinda seemed like he was a dad 

conversation:
user2: Hi there! 
user1: Hello! Have you seen the movie Despicable Me?
user2: No, I haven't seen it but I've heard it was good. Have you seen it?
user1: Yes, and I highly recommend it! simply for the characters of the minnions!
user2: I don't have any information on it. Can you give me a mini-plot of the movie?
user1: It was released in 2010 from Universal Pictures and is about a mean supervillain named Gru! He creates the minnions to work for him. Throughout the film Gru and his minnions fail at their evil doings and eventually foster and adopt these three sisters who wiggle their way into Gru's heart.
user2: That sounds really good. The minions are so cute. What does Gru do as a villain?
user1: It is a great film that is heartwarming and funny for children. However, it also holds the attention of an older audience as well
user2: Does Gru make the minions do evil things or are they good little minions?
user1: The minnions simply make inventions for Gru and assist him in his work. They however are not truly evil and it turns out in the end that neither is Gru.
user2: Awww, that sound like a great family film. I don't see very many animated films but I think I'd like to see this one.
user2: And I know Steve Carell voices Gru and I like him a lot.
user1: Yes! it also has Jason Segel and Russell Brand in it! Which create some great punch lines for a good laugh!
user2: That's funny. Russell Brand has such a distinct voice. What character does he voice?
user1: It also got an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! which isn't two bad. Russell voices Dr. Nefario who is Gru's elderly gadget man and a friendly scientist in the film!
user2: Wow, 81% is a good rating. Dr. Nefario - that's perfect sounding for him. Do the minions talk?
user1: The Cinema Score is also an A!
user2: That's a high score. It's hard for movies to get an A.
user1: The minion's have a language of their own. but not one that the audience can understand!
user1: Jason Segel plays Victor or "Vector" another supervillain who out does Gru! and puts an interesting competitive vibe to the plot line!
user2: Oh, I see. That's cute. I need to see this movie. I know it made a huge amount of money and had a couple sequels. I always thought it was a Disney movie for some reason but you said it was Universal. That's interesting.
user2: Does Gru ever win at any of his evilness? 
user1: Yes! it's Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment!
user1: Yes! towards the end of the movie Gru finally succeeds by shrinking and stealing the moon!
user2: Ha ha...the moon? That's hilarious. I hope he gives it back. Does he?
user1: But in a surprising twist Vector takes the girls and holds them for ransom! Gru gives him the moon to save the girls showing that he has a heart! When he gives it to Vector the moon begins to un shrink and launches itself back into orbit.
user2: That is such a cute plot. I can't believe I haven't seen it. Does Vector look anything like Russell Brand? I know they sometimes make the characters look like the voice.
user1: He has some resemblance like dark colored hair but other than that not really!
user2: I heard Kristen Wiig and Julie Andrews were in it. Did they have fun characters, too?
user1: I don't remember exactly

conversation:
user2: i think that the casting in this is fantastic. steve carell was on top in comedy at the time
user1: this movei came out in 2010, but it feels like yesterday
user1: this movie is where minions come from
user2: thats true. it has serious spawned alot of media and spinoffs
user1: i always liked Gru himself and the girls a lot more
user2: me too. the relationship that grows in the film is great

user1: The antagonist was funny too, i used to have a friend who was obsessed with him.
user2: yeah it was great
user2: i just really love the minions
user2: so funny

user1: What Pharrell songs are in it?
user2: It doesn't say but he did the accompanied songs.
user1: Ok, are there any characters that stand out to you?
user2: Gru is the main character and I like Steve Carell.
user1: If you've seen the Office or Bruce Almighty, is his humor similar to in those?
user2: I think it would be more PG rated but still funny.
user1: About what age level of kids do you think the movie targets?
user2: I'm not sure but I'd say all ages.
user1: Is it a Pixar movie?
user2: No, it is not, but it is inspired by Pixar's quality of animated movies.
user1: Did you like it more than most Pixar movies?
user2: I think the movie is great, on the same level as other great animated movies. It has a funny and original plot and funny characters and good music.
user1: Are there any sequels? 
user2: It doesn't say but I feel like tons of movies have sequels.
user1: Is that the movie with the yellow minions? 
user2: Yes, there are Minions that help Gru.
user1: Is Gru an evil character? 
user2: Yes and no, he is a supervillain that changes his ways when he adopts 3 girls.
user1: Is there more of a prominent villain or antagonist? 
user2: Yes, Gru's archenemy is Vector, another supervillain.
user1: What are the names of the girls he adopts? 
user2: Margo, Edith, and Agnes are the names of the girls.

user2: oh, so it has been around for a while...
user1: it's an animation and it's pretty fnny
user1: funny
user2: gotcha
user1: do you care about ratings?
user2: Yeah, I always check ratings before watching a movie
user2: Specifically, IMDB
user2: and sometimes, Rotten Tomatoes
user1: me too. I usually check rotten tomatoes
user2: My go-to rule: if it's below 7.0 on IMDB, I pretty much always pass
user1: so rotten tomatoes is 81% and metacritic score is 72/100\
user1: no imdb score on here :/
user2: Seems legit. I'm not really familiar with metacritic, but I've heard of it.
user1: In my opinion it's a pretty good movie but i wouldn't watch it twice :)
user1: It's about a villian and his little minions
user2: Sometimes I read reviews from critics too, but they tend to be all over the place. A. O. Scott is one of my favorites. 
user2: I never watch movies twice. Animated, seems like mostly kids movie?
user2: Or, humor for adults too (probably)?
user2: And....this must be related to..isn't there a Minions movie? 
user1: Well critics say it's a pretty good movie. It's for kids but adults like it too
user2: Ok, great. 
user1: there is a minions movie

user2: Gru, a supervillain, is disheartened when an unknown supervillain steals the Great Pyramidof Giza. Gru, with the assistance of his colleague Dr. Nefario and his Minions, resolves toone-up this mystery rival by shrinking and stealing the Moon. As it would be costly to stealthe moon, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Bank president Mr. Perkins is impressedby the plan but will provide the money only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first.Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain named Vector was responsible for the pyramidtheft, Gru starts a rivalry with him.
user1: The rivalry sounds fun to me
user2: yeah ahaha.. there that's I think the simple summary of some scene
user2: I think there is already a part 2 of this movie
user1: Is there? It'd be fun to watch them both in a row possibly.
user2: yeah if there's really a part 2 already it is more fun to watched it will be a movie marathon to be.. Ahaha

user2: hi there
user1: Hello there, good afternoon. 
user1: Whats the name of this movie of which you speak?
user2: have you ever seen dispicable me?
user1: I have not. Whats it about?
user2: It's about a super-villain called gru..
user1: Is it an action packed movie?
user2: He's voiced by steve carell so it's funny.
user1: He's a pretty good actor. Are there minions in this movie?
user2: Yeah I like steve carell. has russel brand in it too, I also like him.
user1: Russel Brand is great. 
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: lol i'm not sure how to answer that.... technically I'm only supposed to tell you about what's in the document they gave me to read... 
user2: they didn't even say anything about the minions on the doc!
user2: this exercise is rediculous...
user1: Gotcha, yeah I was playing along with what they said as well. I can't see the doc. 
user1: The primary purpose my guess is to make sure the chat function is operating. 
user2: I have no idea. lol.
user1: So Steve is in the doc. What else is the movie about? 
user1: We'll just keep going I guess lol. 
user2: ok
user2: yeah he adopts some girls from an orphanage
user1: Cool, the movie already sounds interesting. 
user1: Its a comedy? (I've seen the movie dozens of times just going along with the exercise)

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hey hey
user1: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user2: Despicable what?
user1: Despicable Me.  It's an animated movie starring Steve Carell.
user2: Oh, from 2010? of course
user1: Did you like it?
user2: Yeah! I can't believe it only has 6.8 on RT.
user1: That is surprising.  It still holds up.  My 6 year old loves that whole series.  We just watched the third one a few weeks ago.
user2: Remember Jason Seigel as Victor.?What a riot!
user1: Yes, he was hysterical.
user2: Pierre Colin and Chris Renault really knew what tey were doing when they made that
user2: I can't believe they got RusselBrand to be in the movie. What a get!
user1: I really like Russel Brand, too.
user2: Some critics called it amusing rather than funny, I might agree with them
user1: I think it's very funny, but I like the type of humor in the movie
user2: Gru's whole plot to steal the moon waas pretty crazy.
user1: That's what makes it so funny.  The ridiculous nature of all of it.
user2: Cinemascore gave the film an A, which I think was generous
user2: Gru's whole rivalry with Vector was classic. It reminded me of citizen Kane.
user1: I think it deserved that score.
user2: try and pick up the pace a bit, huh? I thought the 3d aspects of it were really well rendered but not the best of hollywood
user1: 3d aspects?
user2: The song by Pharell on the soundtrack was really terrific. I could listen all day to it.
user1: Was it filmed in 3D originally?
user2: Sergio Pablaso's story greatly ebnifited from another dimension of broadcasting in thaters I thought
user1: What do you mean by that?
user2: seriously, you need to  respond faster. All in all in a pretty okay Pixar movie, right in the middle, toward the bottom in rank
user2: dimensions. as in there were 3 of them.
user1: Why the attitude?  Are you having a tough day?
user2: I can't believe there were so many minions! So cute! I love them!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hi
user1: how are you?
user2: I'm pretty good
user2: What did you think about Despicable Me?
user1: I think that considering it got an 81% on Rotten Tomato it must be a great movie
user1: what about you?
user1: do you like computer-animated comedy films like Despicable Me?
user2: Maybe not "great" exactly, but a good family flick. One of the reviews said that "it's no first rank CGI cartoon." But another "Despicable Me can't help but be likable," so it sounds better than average to me.
user2: They aren't what I typically go for in a film, but I'm open minded. I do like to idea of a villain being the protagonist in a film, though.
user2: You rarely see that
user1: yeah I agree. following around a villain as the main character is a really interesting new spin
user2: What about you, do you like CGI/Pixar-style movies?
user1: I do, I think they require a lot of hard work and ingenuity and that makes me appreciate CGI/Pixar-style movies. You know that they really care about the quality of the production.
user1: Do you agree in any way with the ratings of the movie?
user2: That's quite true. The plot is looking more and more interesting and amusing, like it suggests a supervillain has to deal with ll of the mundane annoyances that anybody does at their job.
user2: I think I would agree with them, yes.
user1: Who was the actor that voice acted the supervillain Gru?
user2: Steve Carell, I think.
user1: oh right! I can't believe Jason Segel was in this movie!
user2: I don't recognize Jason Segel, but I know who Russell Brand and Steve Carell are. That's a good sign already.
user2: The name sounds familiar, I just can't remember what I saw him in
user1: right, who were the three girls that Gru has to deal with throughout the entire movie?
user2: Margo, Edith, and Agnes were their names, but I forgot where he encountered them.
user2: Do you happen to know who directed the movie?
user1: yeah of course. It was Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. They are some great directors
user2: I recognize Chris Renaud, but cannot recall if I've seen Pierre Coffin do any other films.
user1: do you remember when Vector gets trapped in the moon as it begins to expand and sends him into orbit? That was so hilarious.
user2: Something like that could be portrayed as quite dark, but they made it funny!
user2: It's amusing to me how shrinking the moon accomplishes no real purpose other than proving something to another supervillain
user2: I like the idea of there being a "Bank of Evil" that supervillains have to go to in order to get loans for their nefarious schemes.
user1: that is so amusing. I still can't believe that Gru got away with stealing the shrink ray from Vector. 
user2: Well, of course he did. He's the "hero" of the story lol
user1: who is the president of that "Bank of Evil" again?
user1: I'm not good at character names in movies lol.
user2: Mr. Perkins. I'm usually not either, but I just couldn't forget him
user2: What did you think of the girls giving Gru the money from their piggy bank so he could keep paying his Minions?
user1: it made my eyes tear up when I saw them be so selfless like that and want to help Gru.Just like one of the critics said, the movie was "fun, with teary bits" and I defintely felt those teary bits hahaha
user1: how did you feel when Vector kidnapped the kids
user2: Oh, totally. I don't cry much, but that moment just choked me up.
user1: I was in COMPLETE tears
user2: My first thought was how Vector shows what a real villain is, compared to Gru who is ultimately a nice guy (even if he is technically a villain)
user2: Vector was just plain cruel
user1: I agree. who animated the movie do you know?
user2: I think it was an entire animation studio, Mac Guff
user2: Who did the main theme song?
user1: oh! That was Pharrell! He is one of my favrorite musicians
user2: I like the message of it, and the irony of it being in a movie about "bad guys" is amusing to me
user2: Well, I think I can say that overall I liked this movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, lighthearted time.
user1: I agree. how old is this movie?
user2: By now, it's 8 years old. Wow, time really flies o.o
user2: Hey, I had a good time talking with you. I'll end the conversation in a sec if that's cool with you.
user1: thats fine
user1: great talking to you!
user1: are we done?
user2: Yeah, I think we covered everything
user2: Have a good one!
user1: have a greate one!

conversation:
user1: Hey :)
user1: Have you seen it? It was just on tv the other night
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: Yes, many times. I love it. What about you?
user2: Yeah, I've only seen it once.  But it was really good.
user2: Steve Carrell is awesome in it, don't you think?
user1: Yes. The whole cast is great but the leading men, Carell, Segal, and Brand all nailed their roles. 
user2: Did you leave?
user1: not me
user1: I thought you did
user1: The story was good. I like the character development for Gru. To me it showed that sometimes people are 'bad' because they lack love in their life
user2: oh, i am still here. i am surprised the rotten tomatoes score is not higher
user2: do you have kids?  did you see it with kids?
user1: Yes, me too. 81% doesn't seem to translate into 6.8 very well
user2: my kids loved it
user1: I do, that is why I have seen it so many times
user2: did you see it in 3D?
user1: No, my kids don't seem to do well with 3D
user2: I like how Gru bonded with the girls
user2: Didn't you?
user1: Yea. It made me happy to see him turn around and learn how to show affection and caring for them
user2: I agree.  Like you said, it's nice when you see people who seem bad have good hearts
user2: Did you like the Minions a lot?
user1: The minions were cute. I like them better in the later movies where they have a bit more of their own personalities
user2: Oh, I haven't seen any of the later ones
user2: I also am surprised the critics did not rate Despicable Me higher
user1: Maybe with the all star cast they expected more, but most characters did not have many lines
user2: Did you know that the directors of the movie were newbies?  That they never directed a major picture before?
user2: What did you think of Vector?
user2: Pretty evil, huh?
user1: I didn't know that they were new directors
user2: I think they were
user1: Vector was pretty much a stereotypical bad guy, I don't think he ever came around to being 'good' if i remember correctly
user2: I liked when the girls tried to offer their piggy bank money to help!  Did you?
user1: Yes, that was very sweet of them
user2: What was the name of the guy with the lab coat who was Gru's friend?
user2: With glasses?
user1: Dr. Nefario 
user2: He was pretty cool too, don't you think?
user2: I don't really know Russell Brand, the voice who played him
user1: He made a lot of the jokes work I think. When he messed up the cookie robots and made i htink it was disco or 'boogie' ones
user1: It didn't sound like him at all! 
user1: He has a heavy British accent
user2: Ha ha.  That was good stuff!
user2: Well, glad we both liked it.  It was a great flick!
user1: Yes. Thanks for the good chat. :) 
user2: Bye now!

conversation:
user1: I agree with the third critic. I smiled, but it was pretty forgettable.
user2: Hello! I just watched despicable me and I thought it was fantastic. I loved how the main character was a "Villain" Instead of a hero. It was a refreshing change don't you think?
user1: I did like that they did it from the perspective of the villain, it was interesting!
user2: Oh! I see we have differing opinions lol. I really thought it was great and I would have to disagree with the third critic. 
user1: That's okay! I just didn't really think it was for me.
user2: Yes! Gru was a great character and like critic number two, I do agree it was a very funny movie. I think its really cool how this was the debut animation film for Illumination Entertainment. 
user2: Thats okay! Differing opinions are cool. 
user1: Has Illumination released anything since?
user2: I'm not sure but I did enjoy steve carrell's performance as gru. The whole cast was great. Who was your favorite?
user1: Probably Russell Brand!
user2: Russel brand is my second favorite! I thought the plot of stealing the moon was hilarious. The absolute absurdity of a a plan like that made me crack up. 
user1: That was pretty funny. I also love the idea of a Bank of Evil.
user2: Same. I thought it was a great sub plot for parents and young adults to enjoy because we've all been there at a bank. I definitely empathized with Gru when he had to apply for a loan. 
user1: Of course. The idea that Gru would have to get the shrink ray first is a little silly, but there are definite real-life parallels.
user2: Agreed, it is silly which makes the juxtaposition between getting the seriousness of applying for a loan and stealing the moon even more funny. Its a nice blend of entertainment for adults and kids and I really appreciate that. 
user1: I guess one of my problems with it was the gimmicky 3D. It didn't bother most of the people who watched it but I didn't enjoy it.
user2: Yeah 3d is something you either love or hate. I didn't mind it. The addition of the girls really made gru's character complex. We can see him becoming conflicted over what really matters to him.
user1: Right. It was interesting to see Gru have to choose between stealing the moon and going to a ballet recital.
user2: I liked the ballet recital was something so mundane and girly amidst all the "villainy" gru was trying to do. It really humanized gru as a character. My favorite scene was when he took the girls to the theme park. I thought that was adorable. 
user1: I also felt that way when the girls offered their piggy bank to pay the Minions. That was very sweet.
user2: I thought so too. That actually may be my actual favorite scene. It was too cute. 
user2: I did think their names were strange though. Margo, edith, and Agnes,are very interesting names for young girls.
user1: They were very antiquated! I don't know any people in this day and age with names like that.
user2: Yeah, they were like old lady names. 
user2: I thought it was funny that he actually was able to steal the moon. I was a little scared when the girl got kidnapped though.
user1: I figured nothing too bad would happen to the girls in a kids' movie, but it was a pretty daring rescue. I was almost worried for them!
user2: true, but thats how good of a movie it was to me. I was so caught up in the story I almost believed it for a moment. Im glad they were able to be rescued. 
user1: I was too. I guess the thing about how a bigger object's shrinkage would wear off more quickly added a bit of danger to everything.
user2: It was cutting it short since it a mid-air rescue. I'm glad vector disappeared with the moon. He was too much of a villain. 
user1: Wait, you thought the villain in a movie about villains was too much of a villain?
user2: I mean there's stealing buildings and then stealing kids. That's going a bit too far for me. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello!
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: I have! :)
user1: how about you?
user2: It think this is the first part, right? I have seen it too
user2: It was hilarious and heart warming
user1: yes I think so, more info will be provided as we go. 
user2: I always think of Steve Carell
user1: Yes I like it also, it is a cute movie, my kids love it
user2: The character he did voice over for was the villain
user1: Is it Vector?
user2: No Gru
user1: oooh, yeah! looks like Jason Segel is Vector, didnt know that!
user2: Vector was his enemy
user1: yes lil nerdy one!
user2: Yes
user2: It
user1: aww the girls are so sweet, they bring out Gru's good side
user2: It is amazing how the little children change Gru
user2: Do you like animated movies?
user1: Yes I do, I kind of have to due to having two young children, it's what is on our TV 50% of the time
user2: That's true, you get hooked onto it too
user2: Plus animated movies like these often have a heartwarming message and moral
user1: yes and its amazing the movies they make now days, I honestly think they arent just for children! :)
user2: I think all age groups enjoy animated movies
user1: yes they do normally portrays values and morals and then bit of comedy
user1: Vector is a sneaky jerk, stealing the girls EVEN after Gru gave him the moon
user2: Is this a Disney Pixar movie?
user1: I think so...but not certain
user2: No sorry, it is Universal Pictures
user1: i didnt realize that movie was 8 years old now also!
user1: ratings are good on it! 
user2: Yes, pretty high on rotten Tomatoes
user1: I agree with the ratings though, it is a good movie, entertaining and cute

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello there
user1: How are you
user2: I'm doing fine, how about you?
user1: I'm good. Have you seen despicable me?
user2: I have, I think it's a pretty fun movie.
user1: Yeah same here. I've seen all three of the movies. The second one is my favorite
user2: I think my favorite would still be the first. I really liked the set up to the series.
user1: Yeah. The first one will always be a classic. I think what I like most about the movie is when he gets attached to the girls and I also like the minions.
user2: Me too, I liked those kind of character arcs. I love the minions too, there were definitely a highlight.
user1: I know it's wonderful. One of my younger cousins loves the minions. Whenever he would cry I would put despicable me on and he would stop crying in an instant. The best thing about this movie is how family oriented it is.
user2: That's very true. When I have a family get together myself, usually that is a pretty safe bet that everyone will it enjoy and have a good time.
user1: Yes, I love family gatherings. We always end up having fun and a good time. I believe movies bring families together too and think despicable me is one of those movies that wlll do that
user2: I agree. Animated movies like this or pixar movies, can give families nice quality time together. Despicable Me also has a pretty good message that everyone can takeaway with.
user1: Yes I agree. I'm a big fan of animated movies and grew up on Disney and Pixar movies. I always thought that the ones I grew up watching would always be the best and they are but even the new ones be pretty good too.
user2: Me too. I think as long as film makers make animated movies for the right reasons with their heart in the right place, there will always be classic animated movies that everyone can enjoy of any age.
user1: Yes that's right. I believe it teaches both kids and adults a lot. It's almost like the best of both worlds.
user2: It really is the cream will always rise to the top for future generations.
user1: Yeah. I just hope they'll continue to make good animated film when have kids someday. The only thing I can't get into is the new cartoon shows they have for kids.
user2: Yea I don't get the new shows either, there's just too many that feel slapped together with no meaning.
user1: Really. I just get any of them,but I do like some of the new  adult cartoons but some I don't get either
user2: I do like adult oriented cartoons too. I just think some are made without a lot of care.
user1: Yeah I agree. It wouldn't help for them to do like they do with animated movies. Maybe they could add a few lessons that we can earn too.
user2: That would be good. Make them more accessible for everyone without losing quality of the product.
user1: Yes. I have a feeling it's going to get worse over the years. 
user2: Me too. But you never know. It could be great in the future.
user1: Yeah that's true. I just hope the make at least one more despicable me movie
user2: That would be pretty awesome.
user1: Yeah. Well it was nice chatting with you. I hope you have a wonderful day.

conversation:
user2: So what movie did you watch?
user1: The movie is Despicable Me. 
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: I have not, please tell me a little about the movie?
user1: It's an animated Pixar type film about a villain who winds up with a soft heart.
user2: Whom was the main character?
user1: Do you like animated films?
user1: The main villain who is also the protaganist is Gru
user2: Animated films yes I love them.
user1: With the voice of Steve Carell
user2: What was your favorite part of the move?
user2: movie?
user1: Personally, my favorite part are the Minions, which are these little yellow critters that are Gru's, well, minions
user2: Do they have different names?
user1: The main plot is that Gru wants to steal the moon.
user1: Not really. But I think a few of them have names
user1: Jason Sefel plays Victor Perkins, Gur's archenemy.
user2: Why do they steal the moon?
user1: To be the greatest villain ever of course!
user1: In the meantime, Gru adopts 3 little girls to use them to get to Perkins
user2: What Perkins?
user1: Gru's archenemy
user1: I mentioned him just before you asked about the moon
user1: Using the little girls he gains access to Victor's fort to steal a shrink ray
user1: So that he can shrink the moon and steal it.
user2: This seems like a great movie!
user2: What else can you tell me about it?
user1: It is. It's really cute.
user1: But still entertaining for adults.
user2: How long is the movie?
user1: In the end Gru succeeds in getting the moon but he misses the kid's recital.
user2: How does that effect Gru?
user1: It's about an hour and a half I think but the info doesn't say that exactly.
user1: He misses the recital and Victor kidnaps the girls.
user1: Hate it when that happens...

conversation:
user2: Hi! Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: Yes I have! It was great!
user2: I thought so, too! Highly recommend it - and it loks like other do as well. Rotten Tomatoes rates it at 81%
user1: It was better than expected - thats for sure! The comedy, the references to pop-culture, and the heartwarming message were all great!
user2: I also really liked the concept - the Bad Guy is the central character. And wow does he steal the show!
user1: True life, the main people in your life aren't always the good guys
user2: True! And if there is anyone out there who isn't convinced that they should see this film - Steve Carell... that's all I have to say. He's great as Gru!
user1: He is a comedic genius! Anything he touches in entertainment is golden!
user2: You know, I never realized until tonight the Jason Segal was the 'arch nemesis' villin. That's funny. I really like him, too.
user1: So many comedians in one movie!
user2: Then, of course, there's the Minions - lol!
user2: Are you there?

conversation:
user2: Hello, have you seen the move Despicable Me? 
user1: hello
user1: yes 
user1: actually which one is that about
user1: I dont think I was saw it
user2: It is a wonderful animated movie, with a number of cute little characters.  It stars Steve Carell, Jason Segal and Russell Brand.  
user1: what conflict do those cute little characters have to face?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Despicable Me - it has a rating of over 81% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Hi, what did you think about Gru? 
user2: I think the rating should have been higher.
user1: I've actually never watched this film, but have always wanted to
user1: What are your thoughts about Gru?
user1: The archetypal villain?
user2: You should definitely watch it. It is funny and touching at parts.
user1: Definitely sounds like a very unique film
user2: I think Gru is awesome. He makes a great main character.
user1: I notice it has great reviews from the critics as well
user2: Yes, it does. Again, I believe the ratings don't quite show how great this movie is.
user1: Steve Carrell plays Gru, I notice. Sounds like a strong performance. 
user2: I love how the movie shows a rivalry that isn't between hero and villain, but villain and villain. 
user1: Yeah, I agree. I've also quite often found that ratings (at times) are not reflective at all of how good / bad a movie is.
user1: Yeah, that's definitely a new twist.                  
user2: I personally think that Mr. Coffin and Mr. Renaud did a great job directing, 
user1: Sounds like movie has great humor, action and heart!
user1: From what I read of the plot, it also sounds like there are quite a few twists and turns...
user2: It truly does. I also find it interesting that Mr. Perkins (the bank president) is Gru's rival's father. 
user1: Yeah, that's interesting and I think his minions sound cute too. As well as the three orphan girls. 
user2: Mr. Perkins CONVENIENTLY decides that Gru isn't the man for the job of stealing the moon.  
user2: They do sound cute. I love how Gru starts to warm up to them at the theme park.
user1: The whole plot is just so imaginative to begin with! Stealing the moon, how creative is that?
user1: All-in-all, just a very captivating film with an engaging narrative and imaginative characters...
user2: I know! 
user2: I think that Vector is just a horrible person.
user2: I love that he was left stranded on the moon. 
user1: Despicable in name only! (the movie title I'm referring to here)
user1: Ahh, yes I agree. I haven't watched yet, just familiar with the plot details, some characters etc. 
user1: But that sounds like a fitting ending
user2: The whole movie is just amazing. You really need to see it. 
user1: I will for sure. Adding it to my watch list!
user1: From what I've seen in the trailers, the animation looks gorgeous, bright and nicely rendered with a deft touch of simplicity to it, causing it to be not too overly glossy and polished
user2: The characters are lovely, the plot actually has some depth to it (enough for adults to like, but not enough to be complicated for kids), and the feel of the movie is perfect.
user1: I also love that it's in 3D
user1: I think that's a great ability of Pixar films, to be able to make films for adults and kids alike. 
user1: Well, thank you for chatting. It's been nice talking to you!
user2: I know. It is hard to believe it was released in 2010. Every time I see it, it feels like the first time. You'll see once you watch it.

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: Have you seen Dispicable ME?
user1: I have! It was very cute.
user2: I thought so too. Have you seen any of the sequels?
user1: No just the first one. 
user1: I noticed they did a lot of minion spin offs.
user2: I only saw the first one and the first Minion spin off
user2: The Minions movie was not very good...
user2: In my opinion lol
user1: It seems like it would be TOO much minion. haha.
user2: Sorry, i'm not following the format for the discussion we are supposed to have lol.
user2: Um. It was nice that the villian ended up being so likable.
user1: Yes it was very refreshing haha
user2: The humor was also good for both adults and children.
user1: What do you think about the Score given by Rotten Tomatoes?
user2: Thats why I like Pixar movies so much
user2: I think the score is accurate
user2: It was a good movie, but it wasnt my favorite Pixar flick
user2: what sabout you?
user1: I think the score could have been higher.
user1: It was the director's debut film.
user2: I did not know that
user1: I also didn't know that Jason Segal played victor
user1: Do you let the ratings of movies influence whether you watch them or not?
user2: I think I heard that some where. Im suprised how many famous actors do voice acting for Pixar movies.
user2: It took me a while to recognize the voice of the main character from Monsters vs Aliens. It was Reese Witherspoon!
user1: I did not know that, but I think Steve Carell did a good job as the voice of Gru in this movie.
user2: Definitely.
user2: The kids were adorable
user1: I like the part in the movie when Gru gets the kids to warm up to him! They really were!
user2: I still quote "Its so fluffy!!"
user2: lol
user2: Did you like the ending?
user1: I did not like when Vector kidnapped the girls.
user2: Oh yeah. Sometimes those scenes get a bit more stressful than I think are needed.
user1: Agreed, but he got what he deserved wht the moon started to un-shrink back to it's original size.
user2: Yes. Do you think ulitmately that Gru could actually be a good parent and role model?
user1: I think so, he showed he cared about the girls by going into space to rescue them in mi-air! 
user2: The girls care for him as well

conversation:
user2: hi the movie is here despicable me would you be interested in learning more about it?
user1: yes of course. tell me about it!
user2: this movie is animation based and its a comedy movie but also awesome graphics that would entertain any kids
user1: that sounds pretty interesting. do you know any of the storyline of the movie? 
user2: yes, a man who delights in all things wicked, supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) hatches a plan to steal the moon. Surrounded by an army of little yellow minions and his impenetrable arsenal of weapons and war machines, Gru makes ready to vanquish all who stand in his way. But nothing in his calculations and groundwork has prepared him for his greatest challenge: three adorable orphan girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher) who want to make him their dad.
user1: wow steve carell and miranda cosgrove are some pretty big names in this film. little yellow minions sure can attract the views of a child, which is why i see why you said the movie would entertain any and all kids. is gru successful in stealing the moon?
user2: yes he did successfully stole the moon but Do you generally watch movies with (good/bad) ratings? 
user1: i try to look beyond the ratings if i want to see the movie. but yes typically so
user2: ok the ratings are Rotten Tomatoes:81% and average: 6.8/10 Metacritic Score: 72/100 CinemaScore: A
user1: rotten tomatoes having a score of 81% is pretty high! the movie must be very highly liked among lots of people
user2: yes theres even people that commented "Short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but belikable."
user1: did anyone comment any really negative things about the movie?
user2: surprisingly i see none who commented negatively to this movie 
user1: thats crazy. must be a really great film! what do you think of it?
user2: I think its a great movie with awesome 3D cartoon that will make kids go crazy for it
user1: i agree. maybe i will go to see it. seems like a really really popular movie
user2: yes you will also love even if ur adult thank you enjoy the movie
user1: thank you for explaining it to me i will 
user2: let me tell you more about the movie 
user1: yes tell me more
user2: this is another key lines of the movie Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals the shrink ray. Thegirls then suggest a day at a theme park; Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girlsthere, but instead he warms up to them. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, statingthat he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, andPerkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund hisoperations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girlsoffer the contents of their piggy bank. Gru, inspired, sells parts of his lair to construct aspacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest the Earth, but this is the sameday as the girls' ballet recital. Gru becomes conflicted, and Dr. Nefario, seeing the recital asinterfering with the plan, arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage. At the sametime, Perkins informs Vector, revealed to be Perkins' son, of Gru's possession of the shrinkray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to act. 
user1: wow i cant believe that Gru has to deal with these little girls while hes trying to steal the moon. talk about being side tracked. the girls love gru and his minions though so thats great
user2: Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon, and rushes back to Earth to attend therecital—only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arrivingat Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flyingoff with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered that the effects of theshrink ray are temporary; the bigger the object's original size, the faster the shrinkage willwear off. As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minionsexecute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's shipand launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it.
user1: wow. rest in peace to Vector but gru didnt think he can actually get away with stealing the moon did he? :/ hopefully he didnt. this movie has so many twists and turns i cant even begin to imagine how colorful the 3d cartoons look
user2: yes he might have stole the moon but effect of the shrink ray are temporary and yes I agree its a colorful visual movie
user1: really really interesting plot line hope it was a happy ending
user2: yes
user1: i think i will go watch it
user2: you will enjoy it thank you 
user1: thank you!

conversation:
user1: seen any good movies?
user2: Yes, I have seen good movies and to be exact Despicable Me was excellent.
user1: what kind of movie is it?
user2: The Genre is Animation which the kids will love and the adults will smile with amusement
user1: Are there any good actors doing the voices?
user2: Yes, Steve Carrell plays Gru a mean supervillain, Jason Segel as Victor "Vector" Perkins Mr. Perkins' son and Gru's archenemy, and Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario Gru's elderly gadget man and a friendly scientist. It is hilarious with great voices from awesome actors and actress. 
user1: what is the plot of the movie?
user2: Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D.
user1: Is it for adults as well?
user2: As a matter of fact, it is for adults as well its a family oriented movie. All adults will smile with amusement 
user1: Is it a long movie?
user2: No, it is not long at all it is short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny. Despicable Me can't help but be likable.
user2: It is the right amount of time to enjoy a very likeable move
user2: moviei
user1: Is it a stand alone movie or are there more than one?
user2:  I am not sure about that but did you know it was released on July 9, 2010, in the United States. It is the debut film of Illumination Entertainment.
user1: wow it's been out for awhile.
user1: Is the story based off of a book?
user2: Yes it has been out for a while.
user2:  I am not sure about that but how do you feel about seeing movies with a rating of 81% and average 6.8/10?
user1: Sounds good i like good movies.
user1: do you know who the director is?
user2: That's great it's no first-rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quality over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Fun, with teary bits, for kids; fresh and smart for adults.
user2: Yes the directors are: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud
user1: Awesome thanks i will have to check this movie out.
user2: You are very welcome considering the fact that Villains so often steal the show in animation. Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru.
user2: I think you will absolutely enjoy it 
user1: Sound like a nice change of pace i think i will as well.
user2: And once again it does have teary bits for the kids but it may pull at your heartstrings as wells but there will be a lot of smiles and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater. 
user1: i always enjoy pixar movies.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello

user1: yes
user1: steve carrel is good
user2: I'm impressed that it was Illumination Entertainment's debut film
user1: yeah
user2: Also, the movie definitely launched Pharrell into the spotlight with his music. 
user1: true
user1: Jason Segel is good too
user2: definitely
user2: I think it's funny that his rival's name is Vector
user2: And that he wants to steal the moon. That's something that I can't relate too, but is funny in the movie
user1: cute joke
user2: And the movie relates to parents, kids, and adults. Pretty hard to do that!
user1: yeah
user1: impressive
user1: the Animation is good
user2: I love how he takes the girls to a theme park and think's he's going to abandon them. then he ends up "falling" for them. And when they give him their piggy banks, so adorable
user1: hehe
user2: Although, Dr. Nefario makes me mad! How could he return the girls? 
user1: villain that turns out to be good hearted
user2: which is partly why the movie is so good, it's a twist
user1: yeah
user1: it is good
user2: I love how once Vector takes the moon to his ship, the moon starts to expand! What a cool idea
user2: And it's funny that Gru succeeds, at least for a little while, in shrinking the moon
user1: yes, funny
user1: moon shrinker
user2: And it shows how much he cares about the girls because he rushes back to earth, trying to get to their recital
user2: Yes moon shrinker should be his new name
user1: good story
user1: clever jokes
user2: yep, quality jokes over crass jokes, which makes the movie enjoyale
user1: Gru is such a funny character
user1: nice talking to u. Have a good one
user2: He really is. But he has such a big heart, too! There's so much depth to him
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: I like despicable me
user1: I think it's ok. It looks like it got a much better rating than what I would have given it. 
user2: I feel like it is a good movie for children. It is quite informational and brings sweet and amusing entertainment. 
user1: I did not know that Jason Segal was one of the voice actors in that movie. 
user1: I agree, I think one of the best parts is that even though it is children friendly, adults can enjoy it just as much
user2: I don't really remember where I have seen jason segal from
user2: I kinda liked the song that pharrell did. Was it the song Happy?
user1: Pixar seems to be very good at doing that. Jason Segal has played in a couple of different things, I remember him from Freaks and Geeks when he was younger and then he was also in I Love You, Man
user1: Yes! I liked that song as well
user1: The movie seemed to make it really popular
user2: I remember that song blasted on the radio non stop!
user1: I think it's funny that the minion craze is still a think
user1: thing*
user1: I know they made a Despicable Me 2, but the minions really took off haha
user2: Was despicable me 2 about the purple minions?
user1: I'm not sure! I haven't see that one to be honest
user2: Haha yea I don't remember much about it
user2: I thought it was quite weird when gru was able to shrink the moon.
user2: It was interesting but also the physics on that is quite off. 
user1: Haha yeah totally, I think that's the point of animation though. To be able to make those kinds of things a reality. I really liked how this animation kind of show cased a villain
user1: I think its kind of funny how Gru warms up to the girls 
user2: I love how the girls change Gru into such a warm character
user2: It shows that Gru has a good side to him even though he still kinda wants to be bad
user1: I know I totally agree. I think its kind of interesting as well, because even though he was the villain throughout the entire movie, he was still a likeable character. 
user1: I think adding the aspect of the little girls into the movie really kind of solidified his character 
user2: I agree and I also loved their acting 
user2: I think miranda cosgrove played one of the girls?
user1: Oh really? I had no idea!
user2: I thought it was pretty cool that the moon grew after they shrunk it
user1: What did you think of the ending?
user1: I really liked it.
user2: I thought the ending was quite sweet
user1: Now I want to watch some highlights. Maybe I'll watch it again soon haha 
user2: haha yea its worth watching again.
user2: I think they made 2 more after this one right?
user1: I know they for sure did a Despicable Me 2, but I would not be surprised if they did another after that 
user1: It was very popular
user2: It was quite popular but i dont really like how people always want to stretch out the movies
user2: well it was great talking to you! 

conversation:

user2: I've watched it in 3D
user1: WHat would you rate in on a A, B, C D F scale?
user2: I will rate it A. Just like the CinemaScore rated this movie.
user2: What about you?
user1: I think i would agree. I love Pixar movies
user1: I had not heard of the directors though, have you?
user2: Me too. I think Despicable movie is my favorite.
user2: The directors are Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.
user2: They are great!
user1: I really like the super villan Gru. Do you remember the part where he steals the Great Pyramid
user1: wait i must be confused
user1: can you help me remember it
user2: I dont remembered that part.
user1: i think someone else stole the pyramid
user2: What is your favorite part of the movie?
user1: i like the girls and when they empty their piggy bank 
user1: what is your favorite part
user2: The ending part of the movie.
user1: the end part is good too 
user1: and when the three girls are adopted
user2: When the girls are performing their ballet recital for Gru,
user1: yes that is sweet 
user1: i think they are my favorite characters 
user2: I liked them too.
user1: funny what happens to vector
user2: Who is your favorite minions/
user1: i am not sure they are all cute. how about you
user2: Its Bob. He is my favorite
user1: yes bob is good

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi. I think you should watch Despicable Me, if you want to see an amusing animated film. 
user1: What is it about? 
user2: It centers around a super villain named Gru, who is voiced by Steve Carell.
user1: Oh cool is it scary?
user1: or like a family movie
user2: It's not scary. Both children and adults can enjoy this movie. Kids will think it's fun, and adults can enjoy some of the jokes too. 
user1: Thats cool
user1: are there any other movies or is it just the one
user2: Ah, I'm not sure. You could probably check online. Do you like animated films?
user1: Not normally but my kids do
user2: I think this would be a good one for you all to watch. It has pretty good ratings.
user1: I have seen the minions on stuff before
user1: they seem pretty cute
user2: Yeah. The Minions work with Gru and his colleague Dr. Nefario to steal the Moon.
user1: Oh cool!
user1: They steal the moon!
user1: How?
user2: They have to shrink the Moon first, before they can steal it.
user1: that makes sense
user1: how could they fit the moon on Earth with out shrinking it! So are they inventors?
user2: It's really funny because Gru has to get a loan from The Bank of Evil, so that he can afford to go through with the plan. 
user1: Are there movies like this? Like I have seen mega mind
user2: I haven't seen that one. 
user1: I like it hes like an evil guy who wants to be cool
user2: Gru is an evil guy, but his feelings start to change when he adopts three girls. 
user1: Awee I think I have seen somehting on that
user1: The one likes unicorns?
user2: It's sweet. He has a hard time deciding what to do when the girls' ballet recital is on the same day he wants to carry out the Moon theft.
user1: awe so hes like a fmaily man?
user2: Maybe you could say that. Haha. Spoiler, but, the girls get kidnapped by another villain who wants the Moon. Gru gives it up to save them. 
user1: thats adorable! Now maybe I will have to go find this
user1: You said despicable me right? 
user2: Yeah! I definitely think you should watch it. It has music by Pharrell in it as well. 
user1: I love his music
user2: I don't really know him much, but the song for the film was good. 

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hello, how are you?
user1: Good Thanks! and you?
user2: Great, thanks for asking!
user2: Do you know the name of this movie?
user1: The name is Despicable Me
user2: Oh, I love that movie!
user1: Do you like animation comedies?
user2: Have you seen it before?
user2: Not usually, but this one was very funny and cute!
user2: My kids loved it and I enjoyed it as well
user1: I have! This movie is filled with great comedians such as, Steve Carell, Jason Segal and Russell BRand!
user2: I know, I loved the comedy in it!
user2: Russell Brand was great!
user2: I loved Victor character, the awkward geek with funny Transylvania accent!
user2: and the story of the three adopted kids was very touching!
user2: and of course the Minions- kids love them!
user1: Its no first rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quailty over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Its definitly a fun movie for kidas and fresh for adults!
user1: Its even in 3D
user2: Yes, because there are so many foolish animations out there, but this one is very fresh and innocent!
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it 81% which is a very good rating!
user1: Generally in movies, the villian really steals the show but in this one it is Gru that does it!
user1: Its amusing rather than just boring
user2: Yes, very funny, and Despicable Me II is good as well, as is the Minions movie!

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: have you seen Despicable Me?
user2: hi
user2: Yes, I have seen it a while ago. You?
user1: Yes, a few years ago.
user2: What did you think?
user1: What were your favorite parts or character?
user2: Honestly, while the minions were amusing at times, I was more entertained by the kids. I liked the littlest one the most.  I also liked Gru. He was funny and I enjoyed watching him slowly bond with the kids.
user2: How about you?
user1: my favorite was Gru, maybe because it was Steve Carelll
user1: I like how he changes from being so rude an arrogant and then heartwarming towards the orphans
user1: The good part about this movie is that it is suitable for all age groups
user1: what do you think?
user2: Yeah, Steve Carell is great. It was enjoyable to see his personality change from the beginning to the end, in a good way! I agree that it is suitable for all ages, which is also a plus. Everyone can enjoy it for different reasons, but it's a movie that all ages can watch, so there was no need to cover ears or eyes at anytime like some movies...
user1: Did they have a sequel to this movie?
user1: I didn't get to see that one
user2: I believe so. There may have actually been two out since this one. I'm not entirely sure.
user2: I'm surprised that the ratings are so varied: A, 81%, 72%, and a 6.8/10... I am surprised some were lower than 80 as it was a decent movie.
user2: It says there was a song by Pharell. Do you know what song it was?
user1: Sometimes you can't really trust the ratings. I don't always go totally by it
user1: was it Happy?
user2: That's true!
user2: I feel like it didn't start out happy, but the more he bonded with the kids, the happier the movie got.
user2: What do you think?
user2: Interestingly, after reading the key scenes, I don't remember a lot of what happened in the movie. I need to watch it again.
user2: I do like that Gru was conflicted about stealing the moon vs. watching the girls' dance recital.
user1: I agree with you. The movie changes in the end. But I have to refresh my memory too,,,,,has been a while
user1: Maybe we can watch it again on DVD
user2: I'm sure netflix or amazon may have it too. definitely one to put on my list of things to watch at some point :)
user2: I'm surprised it came out 8 years ago. It doesn't feel that long.
user1: I feel the same, it seems like two to three years ago.
user1: I guess it's because we see the merchandise around in stores
user1: it is still so popular
user2: I agree. Probably right! There is definitely still merchandise out there, but I guess I forgot that there was more than one movie.
user2: Do you know who Jason Segel is? His name is familiar, but I don't know why?
user2: Scene 3 was enjoyable to watch because he is now invested in these girls and the old Gru probably wouldn't care that Vector took the girls, but the new Gru cares about them and creates a plan to save them!
user2: Anything else you liked or disliked about the movie?
user1: I frankly don't remember too many details. But overall it was a fun movie
user1: Since I like Steve Carell, I enjoyed watching Gru
user2: Yeah, I agree. I don't remember much, but I remember liking it.
user2: I guess I didn't like it enough though since I didn't see any other ones...
user2: Anything else we need to mention? I'm not sure what else we should talk about?

conversation:

user2: whats your favorite scene from the movie ?
user1: The plot includes trying to steal the moon, but needing to borrow money from the Bank of Evil.
user2: Sounds like an interesting scene i might have to take my kids to see this sometime 
user1: It is also 3D, which some people really like and others really hate.
user1: It came out in 2010, so it is probably easily found on DVD or similar places.
user2: i just looked up the reviews online it looks like it has great ratings 
user1: There is a shrink ray. evil scientist movies must include a shrink ray.
user2: i bet netflix has this i might have to check 
user1: the ratings were good, but not great.

user1: Rotten tomatoes gave it 6.8/10
user2: little on the low side 
user1: Metacritic gave it 72/100.
user2: any other ratings 
user1: CinemaScore did give it an A

conversation:
user1: Hello. Have you seen Despicable Me? It is a really fun animation movie that came out in 2010.
user2: Despicable me changed up the villian dynamic in animated movies
user2: I have seen it! My kids loved it
user2: Steve Carell is hilarious
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: No. But I would love to see the 3D computer-animated comedy.
user1: I guess it was the first film made by Illumination Entertainment.
user2: It was hilarious and so different than other animated films
user1: I understand the comedy is pretty funny, especially the villains. What did you find funny?
user2: Pharell did some of the music too
user1: Might be worth seeing the movie just to hear Pharrell.
user2: It is full of smart jokes that parents will catch but kids wont
user1: What did you think of the scene where Gru stole the Great Pyramid of Giza?
user2: Gru plans to steal and shrink the moon, another supervillian stole the pyramid
user2: The dynamic between two villians is great
user1: Sounds funny. It received a high rating from Rotten Tomatoes, 81 percent. Do you pay attention to the ratings?
user2: I don't usually on kids films, if my kids are interested, a rating won't deter them.
user2: Do you check out ratings before you see films?
user1: You are right about the plot. Sorry about that. 
user2: Oh no worries! I've seen it a bunch of times lol
user1: Sometimes I will read the critical response. I guess one critic said it had "whiplash-quick laughs." I like that kind of comedy.
user2: Seeing the 3 girls warm up to Gru (and he them) was really sweet too
user2: It reminds you that there is good in everyone, even an evil supervillian lol
user1: What did you think of Gru's rivalry with Vector?
user2: It was hilarious. I love Jason Segal, he holds his own with Carrell
user1: Russell Brand was probably good as well, do you think?
user2: The introduction of the minions is great too
user2: Brand plays Nefario and to be honest, I didn't realize it was him until the 3rd movie
user1: Do you like films of the animation genre? My kids are grown, but I still watch them!
user2: I do! I watched them even before I had kids
user2: The action scene with the rescue of the girls was good too. Intense but not too in your face like some of those Marvel movies.
user1: I was surprised that one critic said there were "teary bits" in the movie. Did you find that to be true?
user2: I did! Gru's relationship with the girls is very sweet.
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: Any scene with the minions. They are adorable and hilarious
user2: And when Agnes wins the unicorn at the amusement park
user2: IT IS SO FLUFFY!!!
user2: Have you seen any of the films by Chris Renaud?
user1: Do you know if Illumination Entertainment has come out with any other movies? 
user1: No, I haven't seen any films with Renaud. 
user2: Or and Illumination Entertainment movies?
user2: I know they do all the Despicable Me and Minion movies
user1: I just know about Pixar. I guess this film was animated by a French studio MacGuff (later became Illumination)
user2: I read that. I was really impressed that this was their first film.
user1: It's hard to believe it was released in 2010 and the minons still remain popular.
user2: I am not surprised, they are the best part of the film.
user2: Have you ever seen the minion movie?
user1: No, I haven't seen it. CinemaScore rated it an A. What would you give it?
user2: I would give it an A
user2: Do you think you will watch it after this?
user1: I haven't heard any negative critical response, other than it's amusing rather than funny, but that might not be construed as negative.
user1: I might rent it sometime if I need a good laugh.

user1: The movie got an 81% on rotton romatoes and average 6.8/10
user1: Would you like to hear about what the movie is about?
user2: yes that sounds good
user2: what about the actors
user1: The movie is voiced by steve carell as Gru, who is a mean supervillan
user1: Jason Segal as Victor "Vector" Perkins, who is Gru's archenemy

user1: and Russell Brand as Dr. Nedario, Gru's gadget man and friendly scientist
user2: how bout the plot
user1: The movie is about Gru, who is a supervillain, and gets upset with another supervillan steals the Great Pyramin of Giza
user1: Gru, Dr. Negario, and his Minions make up a plan to shrink and steal the Moon
user2: sounds like fun
user1: But the cost of stealing the moon is too much and he needs a loan from the bank of evil, who will only give him money is Gru can get the necessary shrink ray
user1: and that shrink ray is in th ehands of his archenemy, Vector
user2: is it a movie you would recommend
user2: as a kids movie
user1: It is a movie that I would recommend. The critics have given some reviews, saying that Despicable Me steals the show
user1: And that kids will love it, as will adults
user2: that is great
user1: One critic said the CGI may not be first-rank, but it shows how Pizar's quality over crass is lovely
user2: anything else was said about the story?
user1: The movie is cute because he befriends three little girls who help Gru steal the shrink ray
user1: He tries to abandon them, but warms up to them 
user2: intresting
user1: The bank decides they are not going to fund him, so the girls and gru raise money to build a rocket ship to get to the moon
user2: cool
user1: It recieved a cinemascore of A
user2: that must mean it is good
user1: There is a daring mid-air rescure too
user2: good

conversation:
user2: Did you like the movie Dispicable Me?
user1: Yes. It had a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 81%. Did you like the movie?
user2: I did. My kids also really enjoyed it.
user2: I think 3D computer animated movies are becoming the norm. My kids think actual animated movies look weird!
user1: My little brothers also enjoyed it. They like animated films. I thought it was awesome they had Steve Carell.
user2: Yes! Steve Carell is awesome! I think he nailed Gru's accent.
user1: I think so as well. He made a funny supervillain. 
user2: He did. I definitely like the approach they took - the supervillian is the star and he winds up being very likeable.
user1: I thought it was exciting for kids, yet adults are still able to keep up with it and enjoy it as well.
user2: Exactly. Kids really enjoyed it but it was also entertaining for adults. The whole family can appreciate it.
user1: I agree. Everyone seems to like it. 
user2: Did you get another movie? Mine's not showing up...
user1: No, same movie. Perhaps the words changed a bit?
user2: lol I guess.
user2: It's interesting that it says "it's no first-rank CGI" I thought the quality was really good.
user1: One of my favorite scenes was Gru seeking a loan from the Bank of Evil. I thought that kept things pretty down to earth.
user2: Yea that was a fun scene. It was different but something the adults could relate to.
user1: I still think it's a great movie to watch today, even though it was released in 2010, about 8 years ago.
user2: I thought Vector's character was perfect too; he embodied the "dorky" evil genius kind of kid.
user2: I agree. My kids watch it practically every day! It's hard to believe it came out 8 years ago!
user2: I thought it was really funny how Vector had the pyramid of Giza in his yard painted like the sky. No one will ever know!
user1: I thought so too. I also enjoyed that Gru had a likeable side despite being the villain; like when he warmed up to the girls. I thought it was nice they offered him their piggy bank as well.
user2: Yea it was really nice to see the softer side of Gru. I really liked that he warmed up to the girls too. The scene at the amusement park - after he destroys a game and the girls want to destroy more - it was priceless. It's interesting that Gru took on being a single dad too - again lots of single parent familys, especially dad-headed households can appreciate that
user2: Kind of random but I also am impressed with Russell Brand's job of Dr. Nefario. I never would have thought he could do such a perfect old guys voice!
user1: Yes. The adoption of the three girls was also heart-warming. It was also funny how over the top some of Gru's goals were - like stealing the moon. It kept the kids entertained. 
user1: Indeed. I thought Russell Brand did a great job!
user2: Yea they really nailed how villian-y isn't all so bad! 
user2: Kidnapping the girls was a twist I didn't really expect but it fit with the movie so well and really showed how dedicated Gru was to getting the girls back.
user1: I thought the spin they did on it was great as well; how Gru's main mission was to shrink the moon, but then later he becomes more concerned for the girls when they get kidnapped by Vector.
user2: Yea it really shows how much maturing Gru did, really. He decides that some things aren't worth it and family is more important. 
user1: The moon problem seemed to fix itself as well with it expanding and launching itself back into orbit with Vector trapped. 
user2: Haha yea problem totally solved. I thought it was cute when Vector realizes how screwed he was. Not sure his inflatable helmet will help him much.
user1: Pixar definitely always manages to wrap up their movies well. 
user2: They do. They definitely deserve the high ratings they receive.
user1: Yeah. Despicable Me was a laugh to watch and made me want to watch more 3D movies by them.
user2: Definitely! Their movies are always fun and creative. 
user2: I think we can finish the conversation, if you're satisfied.
user1: The rating is high for Rotten Tomatoes. I felt they deserved that too.
user1: I think we can finish as well!
user2: Yea Rotten Tomatoes can be brutal sometimes. Im glad they got a high rating with them too
user2: Alright, have a good rest of your day!

conversation:
user2: Hello are you there?
user1: I am! Our movie is Despicable Me. Have you seen it?
user2: Yeah I've seen it
user1: Who is your favorite character?
user2: I like Gru, hbu?
user1: Definitely - Steve Carrell is awesome! 
user2: Yeah, he's a great actor!
user1: It is eight years old already - dang, I feel old
user2: It really is a long time. I can't quite remember the movie too well though
user1: I didn't remember that Russell Brand was Dr. Nefario. I don't remember a huge amount about  it either.
user1: Ohh......it's the movie where Gru is trying to shrink and steal the moon. Do you remember now?
user2: Whoa! I don't remember Russell Brand voice acting a character in the movie!? So what else is interesting about the movie?
user2: Not quite well. All I remember is that there's alot of minions.
user1: I love them lol.....and so do my nieces. Jason Segel was the voice of Mr. Perkins - the Evil bank president.
user1: That's who Gru has to get the loan from so he can buy the shrink ray.
user1: I need to watch this movie again lol
user2: Haha, I know. I think I remember that scene where Gru talks to Mr. Perkins about him getting a loan
user2: I need to rewatch this again. lol
user1: Remember the scene when he took the girls to the park? There is such a sweetness to this movie.
user1: The story is by Sergio Pablos - I am going to look him up to see if he has any books for kids.
user2: Gru wasn't really amused though because of his personality, but he was still kind enough to take the kids.
user2: Sergio Pablos? Who is he?
user1: Apparently, he wrote the story.
user1: It got ratings from Rotten Tomatoes of 81 percent and average 6.8/10. That seems kind of low, but I am not sure what their criteria is.
user2: That just shows people don't look at the directors or writers of book/movie
user1: Agreed. Unless they are celebrities .Do you watch a lot of animated movies?
user2: I agree that's really low rating for an animated movies
user2: Yes I do
user1: Have you seen the second Despicable?
user2: No I haven't actually watch the second and the third.
user1: This also got a rating from Metacritic of 72/100. I don't agree with them, either. Who are these people??
user1: I have seen the second, but not the third one yet either.
user2: Not sure. I know that they probably don't like animated movies or just very analytical about little things
user2: Does it say/show why it's rated very low?
user1: Or maybe they are jaded by Hollywood. No, it gave no reasons - just three listings. Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and CinemaScore, which was an A.
user1: Maybe the CinemaScore was from people who had seen it in the theatre.
user1: Plus, the ratings were from before the francise blew up and minions were everywhere :)
user2: I assume too as well. But I wonder why it was really low 72/100. Does that mean I shouldn't watch the second one then?? :/
user2: I know the minions makes it better! I love how hilarious the movie is, especially the kids making fun of Gru.
user1: It means the opposite  - the second was so funny! I don't pay attention to critics much.

conversation:
user2: How do you like this movie?
user1: Seems pretty interesting for sure
user1: Whats the rating for?
user2: Despicable Me has a fairly good rating. The rating shows how well others liked this movie. 
user1: Ive never particularly watched Despicable Me 
user1: But I was expecting the ratings to be higher than that 
user2: Usually, for movies of this genre, ratings are lower than expected. However that doesn't mean that it isn't a good film. 
user2: Jason Segel is a very talented voice actor who performs as Gru's archenemy
user1: Cool! so he also starred as Vector Perkins?
user2: He did! He worked alongside Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario and Steve Carrell as Gru. 
user2: The story was written by Sergio Pablos. 
user1: Tell me more about Russel Brand
user2: Russell Brand plays Dr. Nefario, a close friend and colleague of Gru. Dr. Nefario makes special gadgets that assist Gru with his goal to steal the moon. 
user2: What else would you like to hear more about?

conversation:
user2: I love Steve Carell. Watch all his movies.
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: Me too. I generally enjoy his characterizations.
user1: Yes. 
user1: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user2: Ehh, not 100%. I think it's slightly overrated.
user2: Not a very popular opinion. Do you agree?
user1: I think for a childen's animated movie, it is good. It give adults some room for jokes, but its really just made for kids in the end. 
user2: Agreed.
user2: The Pharrell song is really catchy though
user1: What song is that?
user2: "Happy". Was a big hit!
user2: It's hard to believe it's going to be 8 years old this year.
user1: Did you know the film was animated by a French studio?
user2: I had no idea. That's pretty cool.
user2: What I do like about this movie is the fact that it's from a villain's perspective.
user2: That's different than the norm.
user1: I do as well. Its really interesting especially in a kids movie

conversation:
user1: hello, have you seen despicable me yet?
user2: yes, yes I have! 
user1: did you know that The film was animated by the French animation studioMac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination Entertainment.
user2: wow, no! I did not know that, fascinating! 
user1: Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any differentafterward than they were walking into the theater.
user2: yes, quite, I concur with you good sir. 
user1: its the kind of movie you can watch several times a month and still have a good laugh 
user2: I cant wait to see the second one!
user1: ohh me too! It looks so good!
user2: I think my kids are getting old enough to sit through a whole movie finally. 
user1: you do know that gru is the evil guy right? 
user2: right, yes I do. hes very funny. and is horrible at being the bad guy. 
user1: here is a classic scene from the movie. Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Bank president Mr. Perkins is impressedby the plan but will provide the money only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first.
user2: omigoodness every scene in that movie is a great scene! 
user1: I agree, thats what makes it so re watchable! 
user2: the minions are so cute and funny. I love how they have their different personalities. 
user1: Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals the shrink ray.
user2: I am familiar with the movie, what if he was able to dhrink the moon? 
user1: ohh goodness, I hope they make many more minions movies. there are so many good ideas I can think of!
user2: that part of what makes minions so great
user1: deep down i think gru has a big heart. 
user2: yes. yes he does
user1: in the movie Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon,
user2: that is so crazy! What could they think of next to top that idea?
user1: I dont know but then he rushes back to Earth to attend therecital—only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls.
user2: ohhh your story is getting good now
user1: As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minionsexecute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's shipand launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it.
user2: This makes me want to go find that dvd and watch it again. 
user1: yeah its been a little while since i have seen it as well .
user2: how many do you think they will make? more minions movies I mean
user1: I do not know but I hope at least a few more
user2: They are good laughs for sure!
user1: Do you agree with the rating of the movie? 
user2: but of course! no one should not be able to see this movie.

conversation:
user2: Hello?
user1: Hi
user1: I have a passage on Despicable Me, have you seen this movie before?
user2: No I haven't. What is it about?
user1: It is an animated film, first off. I have not actually seen it all the way through, just bits and pieces
user2: Okay, interesting. Do you know who acts in the movie?
user1: If I remember correctly, it is about a villain who tries to not be so villainous anymore
user1: Steve Carell is the voice of the villain
user1: He is pretty good in any film he does
user2: Great, thanks. I think I'll give it a shot.
user1: I know that my kid really liked it, she was really a fan of the minion characters
user2: I have seen the minions everywhere, it seems that people love them. So I guess the movie is pretty family friendly?
user1: It certainly is.
user1: This is the movie where the minions began
user1: So, the villain decides that he wishes to steal the moon, after another supervillain stole the Great Pyramid.
user2: Interesting, what makes him decide to stop being a villain?
user1: He adopted 3 girls.
user1: It had been part of his plan to use them to get into his rival's base, but then he allows them to stay with him
user2: Interesting, haha, sounds like sort of a fun plot. Does he successfully get into his base, or is he reformed by the girls?
user1: It is sort of a combination of both. He used them to complete his mission, but then he was forced to save them after they got kidnapped by his rival, Vector
user1: A lot of the comedy is from watching how inept he is around the children
user2: Sounds like a really fun movie. I think I'll watch it with my family
user1: Like I said, my kid really liked it a lot... But then again, she loves just about anything by Pixar

conversation:
user1: hey there, what movie did you see?
user2: The movie is Despicable Me
user1: What is it about?
user2: It's a 3D computer-animated movie about a supervillan
user2: It has funny punch lines and is a movie that both kids and adults like
user2: The cast includes Steve Carell, Jason Segel and Russel Brand
user1: I love Steve Carell and Russel Brand
user1: Is it noticeable that they're the voice actors?
user2: Yes, Steve Carell voices the main character, Gru
user1: Oh, I heard about that!
user2: It got a score on Rotten Tomatoes of 81%
user1: Certified fresh?

conversation:
user1: Hello how are you
user2: Hello! Fine thank you! Have you seen any of he Despicable Me movies?
user1: Yes i have seen them all.
user1: My children enjoy them.
user2: Awesome. If you were to rank them what would your most favorite to least favorite?
user1: I would have to say the 1st one then the Minions one
user2: Yes! That’s my favorite one as well. It really shows a positive parent child relationship!
user1: Do you have kids to watch it with?
user2: Yes my nieces and nephews who are obsessed with them! Are your kids still into them?
user1: yes they are 2, 4 and 11 the youngest ones will always watch the entire movie 
user2: Yes. They little guys are everywhere! I’m guessing the likelyhood of you watching the films again are pretty high especially with your younger ones
user1: yeah i would say there is a 100% chance that I will watch at least one of them
user2: Lol! We all those films have been consecutively some of the highest grossing animated films of all time. It still seems children are still in love with them even after it’s debut in 2010
user1: yes, we watch all the different ones all the time
user2: The first one came out when I was around 13 and 14 and I still love them to death!
user1: Those are some good movies.
user2: Any other films your children are into like Moana or Sing?
user1: They like Sing, Trolls, Secret Life of Pants, and Zootopia..those are the ones that play the most in our hosue.
user1: *Pets
user1: not pants lol
user2: That’s adorable! Do you ever get tired of all the songs and stuff?
user1: nah I just sing along with them
user2: I guess you might as well join in on the fun! That Illumination studios is killing it in the business 
user1: yes they definitely are
user1: Do you know what other movies they have made?
user2: I think the ones you named are it... The studio is still kinda new compared to Disney
user1: that's probably why my kids like them so much!
user2: Yah! They are literally growing up with them! That’s pretyy touching!
user1: So how do we finish up the conversation?
user1: Do you have any other questions?
user1: I'd like to finish the conversation now.
user1: i am going to watch the movie.
user1: Ok since you haven't responded in 8 minutes i'm going to give you 2 more minutes to respond then I am aborting the conversation.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user2: Despicable Me has a high Rotten Tomato score, which means that is well-liked by peers. 
user1: Despicable Me also stars a villain instead of a hero. 
user1: What do you think about it being fresh and smart for adults?
user2: I am not sure I would see it, if I did not have kids.
user2: I think it is a more appealing movie for adults with children. I would want to see this movie, over others, 
user1: That's interesting, because it has a lot of critical responses for adults.
user2: Overall, most of the critic cites gave the movie pretty high ratings. 
user1: How do you think the soundtrack for the Movie would be since Pharrell sings the song "Despicable Me" which Gru names himself.
user1: Have you seen other movies created by Illumination Entertainment?
user2: I do. Pharrell is great at creating songs for movies that can transcend the screen.
user2: I am not sure. I am not very familiar with Illumination Entertainment I guess they are not branded as well as Disney. Have you seen any of their movies?
user2: Do you think that cast or voice actors are a motivator for seeing the movie?
user1: I don't know... because they aren't well branded.
user1: Absolutely! I would want to see a movie voicing Jason Segel.
user1: Why do you think that Gru wants to steal the moon?
user2: Do you usually watch movies that are rated higher by critics or do you not pay attention to reviews?
user1: I don't normally pay attention to reviews for movies; unless there are historical references to the movie
user2: I don't pay attention to reviews, either.  Do you tend to watch this genre of movie? 
user1: Using a shrink ray for collateral is a very interesting concept in the movie
user1: Yes, I'm a kid at heart...
user1: Children's movie's that have adult undertones are the BEST!
user2: I do agree. I like that the Gru is a villian, but has a soft spot for the girls. 
user1: It's adorable! 
user2: I like the conflict between work and family. 
user1: The twist of Vector being Perkins' son is ironic
user1: seeing as though Perkins' wants the Shrink Ray stolen.
user1: It does however, make me wonder what lesson is Perkins attempting to teach Vector.
user2: I enjoy how the bank is called the Bank of Evil and the bank president is also evil.
user1: How does Vector profit from stealing the girls.
user2: I think that part of the movie is predictable. 
user1: I concur. The concept of an Evil bank and Evil bank President is hilarious.
user1: It actually is...
user1: But who would want to be stuck with someone else's kids!
user1: Do you think Dr. Nefario is a good friend to Gru?
user2: That is why the movie was predictable. However, be that as it may, I would still probably see it with my kids. 
user2: I don't know if there was enough character development with his character. 
user1: Right! 
user1: he's just mentioned randomly!
user1: Makes me randomly think: "What does Gru get out of stealing the moon (besides credit)?"
user2: Yes, or what is the point? Yes, it is the moon. At the same time, it is the moon. We know the function it facilitate?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hello there
user1: DO you like animation movies?
user2: did you like the movie?
user1: I have seen the movie, my kids really enjoyed it
user2: i did enjoy it as well
user2: i see that it scored very well on movie reviews
user1: Yes it did score well. I think a lot of familes really loved it 
user1: Gru was one of my favorite characters
user1: The little girls were adorable as well 
user1: Did you have a favorite part or character?
user1: I really enjoyed that they kept it funny as well 

conversation:
user1: I really liked Despicable Me. I enjoy animated movies and Steve Carell was excellent in his voice role.
user2: Hi, yes, I like Steve Carell's work.  He is an actor that exudes slime in a funny way!
user2: Have you seen many 3D animations?
user1: Slime from the movie? I'm not sure I remember that part. There was a lot of funny bits though, so maybe I just lost the memory. 
user1: Yes, I like a lot of Pixars movies. Like Toy Story, Up, things like that.... they're nostalgic and entertaining 
user2: I just meant in general about the slime comment.  Sounds like you know your 3D animation.  This is actually new to me, I'm amazed at the sophistication of the special effects of 3D.
user1: Yeah, it's definitely come a long way in the past few years. I'm really excited to see how movies are going to look in the next couple of decades- the technology keeps getting better and better.
user2: Looks like the reviews are pretty good for this movie, do you agree with them?
user1: Yes, I agree a lot with the idea that both kids and adults will enjoy it. There's comedy at different levels so that it's not just an adult watching a kids movie, but a movie that's appropriate for both adults and kids
user2: I think that's cool that both adults and kids get something out of this movie.  I wonder how many sequels this movie will produce over time?  I wonder if the sequels would be just as good.
user1: I think there are at least two sequels and a spinoff... I haven't seen any of them, but I know the franchise was quite popular for a wshile
user2: I bet they will produce toys based on the movie too, a Gru doll, etc.  Given the times we are in, it is especially fun to have an escape/adventure film like this.  Do you know what else we should address about this movie?
user1: No, I'm not sure what else they want us to cover... I thought it was going to change documents after four comments but I'm not sure.
user2: Let's see...this movie was made back in 2010.  I wonder how many movies since then were directly influenced by this movie's success.
user1: Thats a good question.... 
user1: I know it was very commercially and critically successful 
user2: I'm new to the 3D movie thing.  I love movies, but I tend to watch the old classics.  I'm a big fan of movies from the 1930's, 40's, 50's.  I like film noir, musicals, etc.  What movies do you follow?
user1: I have a wide variety of tastes, but I enjoy everything from the classics to terrible 'B' movies
user1: okay I just got a new document
user2: Me too, tells more about Gru's adventures.
user1: So the scene with Gru at the theme park was really a central part to the film.... it helped to humanize the character and make him less terrifying to the audience. 
user2: I really like movies that develop characters and make them relatable at some level.
user1: Exactly.... you never expect him to become attached based on how he's presented at the beginning of the movie.
user2: Character changes definitely make the movie more interesting.  So do good actors.
user1: The moon expanding scene was very cool.... it goes back to what you were talking about earlier about how amazing the special effects can be in animated movies nowadays. I think that was the highlight of the entire film.
user1: What was your favorite part?
user2: Let's see, so Vector ends up flying out with the moon, is that correct?  Kids are so sophisticated these days because of computers and technology.  When I was a kid I was intrigued by Etch-a-sketch and slinkies!  We've come a long ways.
user2: My favorite part...that's hard to single out.  I definitely also relate to what is going on music-wise in a particular scene.  I think I need to see the movie again to identify my favorite part.
user1: We have come a long ways. And yes, it would be nice to rewatch it. There were so many good parts
user2: Yes, definitely.  I'd like to see it again also because now I have some input from you which makes me appreciate different things going on in the movie that I missed the first time around.
user1: I also want to see the sequels now to see how they differ from this movie. It'd be intersting to see if there's any 'burnout'- that the stories get kind of stale after multiple movies
user2: I also wonder what new characters they would add to each sequel to keep the movies fresh.
user1: Okay, I think we're able to finish the conversation now. It's been really nice chatting with you. 

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi
user2: This movie is kind of old
user2: made in 2010
user1: Yeah, very popular though
user1: Do you usually enjoy animated movies?
user2: Yeah, the ratings are high
user2: I love animation 
user2: Have you heard of the directors
user1: No, I haven't heard of them before. I wonder if they do a lot of work on Pixar movies.
user1: I am familiar with the actors though, how about you?
user2: I never heard of them either
user2: The name Russell Brand sounds familar
user2: The other actors never heard of them
user1: The scene they describe sounds fun. I actually haven't seen the movie even though it's old
user2: I have not seen the movie either, however, the plot sounds interesting
user1: Russell Brand and Steve Carell are probably good as the villains in this scene. They are usually pretty funny
user2: Sounds like it would be pretty funny
user1: It says the film has a song by Pharrell, I think I've heard that on the radio
user2: Yep, If its the song I think it is. I love that song
user2: Hopefully the animation quality is still very good
user1: Me too! I have seen the Minions before, but the description only mentions them briefly
user2: Gru plans to steal the moon. So evil lol
user1: Very evil, haha
user1: He already stole the Pyramid
user1: Oh, no, another villain stole it
user2: I see
user2: He is successful and steals the moon
user1: Yes, it sounds like he won't get away with it since the shrink ray will wear off
user2: Looks like Vector spoils his plans
user1: Sounds like an exciting scene
user2: Yep, probably one of the best scenes because the minions, gru, and Dr. Nefario save the girls 
user2: before the moon explodes
user1: Poor Vector, he is trapped on the moon
user2: lol
user2: Thanks for chatting
user2: bye

conversation:
user2: Hi there
user1: Hello
user2: So the movie you need to watch is Despicable Me.
user1: That sounds like an interesting title. Can you tell me about the plot of the movie?
user2: This particular page doesn't dive too much into the plot, but it has a rotten tomatoes score of 81% with a 6.8/10 average.
user1: Okay
user1: What is the score?
user1: Can you tell me anything specific about the movie?
user2: Its a animated movie with characters voiced by Steve Carell, Jason Segel, and Russell Brand
user1: So it sounds like it might be a funny film?
user1: Are you still here?
user2: Yes, sorry
user1: Is this a G-rated movie?
user2: That information is not listed, but I would guess its probably PG
user1: If you have or had kids, would you feel comfortable taking them to see it?
user2: For sure.  One critic even says Kids will dig it and adults will smile with amusement
user2: The plot revolves around a super villian named Gru who wants to steal the moon
user1: Hmm. Does it seem like it has sci-fi involved?
user2: Not so much sci-fi, but more of comedy.
user1: I see. Who plays the villain?
user2: Throughout the movie, Gru tangles with his rival, Vector to try to be the best super villian
user1: Is this more of a movie boys would like? It sounds like it to me.
user2: I would think so, but Gru does become a foster home for 3 young girls that are fun and shape the main character throughout.
user1: That sounds like a good twist. Do you know which star does the voice for Gru?
user2: Steve Carell plays Gru and Jason Segel voices his rival Vector.
user1: Do the characters wear capes and stuff or are they more like animal characters?
user2: The characters are just like you and me.  Usually with super villians comes super heroes, but not in this movie.
user1: I guess I am trying to find out what they look/dress like. So they are basically human characters?
user2: They are for sure humans
user1: If they characters are villains do you think there is still a moral to the story or a good ending? If it is a kids movie I would hope so.
user2: Good ending for sure.  There is a moral to the story and the three girls help Gru to see it.
user1: Thank you.

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hello, how are you?
user1: I'm good, just reading about this movie
user2: Very nice. What movie are you reading about? Does it seem interesting? 
user1: It's Despicable Me. It does seem quite interesting. its an animated film
user2: Oh yeah, I've seen advertisements for it everywhere! Minions are pretty popular because of it.
user1: Yep.  its definitely for kids and according to this document, "adults will smile with amusement"
user2: Yes, I am pretty sure its a movie aimed towards families. Is it a Dreamworks film or Disney?
user1: wow, it was made in 2010. I can't believe it's already been eight years
user2: Wow I feel old now. Have you ever seen the movie before? 
user1: It's Universal
user1: Yeah I think I saw it in theaters
user2: Nice. Yeah I think I've seen it, or at least part of it. I would have been in high school at the time it was released.
user2: I'm still amazed that it's been ten years already!
user2: or eight haha
user1: Haha, yeah. I just got the second document and it's completely blank. seems like a good sign
user2: Make the movie up haha
user1: I think they're all supposed to be about Despicable Me so i guess i'll just tell you more info from the first doc
user2: That's odd, perhaps there is some sort of a mix up with the documents. 
user1: Steve Carell, Jason Segel, and Russell Brand were all in it
user2: Really? Who did they voice? 
user1: Oh yay, the second document finally loaded in
user2: Is that perhaps mentioned in the document?
user2: Oh yay!
user1: Steve was Gru, Jason was Victor Perkins and Russell was Dr. Nefario
user2: I didn't even put the voices with the characters. Now it seems so obvious. 
user2: Is the second document also discussing Despicable me? 
user1: yes, it talks about the key scences
user2: what are some of the key scenes?
user1: wow it got a 81% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: That's actually not that great for rotten tomatoes. It's a pretty popular film so I am actually quite shocked the rating isn't higher
user1: Key scenes; Gru shrunk the moon with a shrink ray and stole it successfully and rushed back to earth to attending the three little girls' recitial
user1: I was actually expecting it to be lower on rotten tomatoes
user1: I forgot there was a shrink ray in this movie
user2: Touché. haha
user2: Yeah I think that was the major point because he wanted to steal the moon, but didn't until the end or something
user2: And I can't remember why he takes in the three little kids.
user1: I think they were orphans?
user2: Yeah, I remember that part, but why did he take them in? Did he get money for them?
user1: I don't remember. and they dont talk about it in the document
user1: hmm.. well I'm getting the option to end the conversation so maybe we've talked about it enough

conversation:

user1: Bet thats great ha
user2: It is.  It was released in July of 2010.

user2: It is definitely better than Shrek.  Very funny, and has a great cinemaScore of A
user1: For sure
user2: Yes, Gru is played by Steve Carell.  Ad Jason Segel plays Vecor, Gru's archenemy.
user1: I think thats good but than rotten tom will give it a whole different rating
user1: i love steve
user2: Yeah, rotten tomatoes are at 81%, but average is 6.8/10
user1: that snot even comparable
user2: But its a very cool 3D computer-animated comedy film
user1: idk i guess so
user1: that would be ool
user2: If you love villains, 3D animations, and just plain fun in a movie then you should watch it!
user2: Its for sure a movie for both kids and adults!
user1: I will try. Do you think a 4 or 5 is coming soon?
user1: i guess
user2: I don't know about that!

conversation:
user1: Ah batman v superman. that was a good movie
user1: waity I chose batman versus superman not despicable me. but despicable me was a good movie too. 
user2: yes it's good movie
user1: steve carell's voice was kinda annoyign throughout though 
user2: very super
user2: good
user1: you have to make a conversation. using more than just one word
user2: very nice
user1: ok i'm aborting this, so the cmu people can set up a new partner. stop doing this hit if you can't follow directions. 
user2: good very super

conversation:
user2: Did you watch Despicable Me in theaters or afterwards? 
user1: I watched afterwards on Netflix and you?
user2: I watched it in theaters with some family members. They adored the movie as did I! 
user2: Do you agree with the ratings of the movie? 
user1: That's great I love that its a family movie where both kids and adults can enjoy. Did you watch the sequels ?
user1: I do I would have rated it the same. I feel that rotten tomatoes are always spot on with their reviews
user2: I can't recall if i've seen the second one! 
user2: Haha, I completely agree with you on that. 
user1: I believe they are working on the 3rd one now..not sure if it already came out 
user1: Have to say though my favorite line was "its so fluffy" 
user2: Yeah I've heard that. Did you see the second one? What did you think about it? 
user2: Yes! I agree, I LOVE agnes! 
user1: She is SO CUTE. at one point I kept calling her Angus haha. 
user2: Haha that's really funny!! :D 
user1: I don't think I have seen the second one either. 
user2: simple mistake! 
user1: I wasnt paying much attention to the plot. Those darn minions are so stinking cute 
user2: I really do like the minions! 
user1: Do you like animation movies ?
user2: I think Pixar made tons of money off of this-- did you download the minion game that was similar to temple run? 
user1: There is a minion game ??? No i did not. 
user2: I'm not a big movie person in general, but I do like animated movies made by Pixar. 
user2: Yeah! I don't know if you've ever played temple run, but it is kind of like that! 
user1: I have played temple run and didnt ever get really far hah 
user2: yeah it can get pretty difficult! But the minion version is so much better, and very cute! I highly recommend. 
user1: I will definitely check it out... I'm sure my kids will love it ! 
user2: I bet!! 
user2: My niece and nephew always ask me to play it. 
user1: I just realized after reading the notes they they have a "bank of evil".  
user2: Wait, where in the notes is that? :O 
user2: oh wait i found it! 
user2: Probably formally lehman brothers hahah 
user1: Ok great. So sweet of the girls to offer their piggy bank. I cant remember if they were girl scouts or not 
user1: haha!
user2: I don't remember! 

conversation:
user1: Let's chat about Despicable Me.
user2: Hi, what is the name of the movie?
user2: Okay I got it.
user1: Despicable Me. It's a Universal Pictures animated film from 2010. Starring Steve Carell as Gru.
user2: Is the movie good?
user2: Is it funny?
user1: It is a full of quick-laughs and funny punch lines. It's also available in 3D!
user2: Is 3D the way to watch it?
user1: Kids love it, adults adore the humor. Rotten tomatoes even gave it 81%! 3d is always an enjoyable way to watch, however, you won't miss anything if you watch it in just 2d!
user2: Where did you find it? Netflix HBO etc.

conversation:
user1: hi
user1: have you seen despicable me?
user2: Yes, have you?
user1: yes it is a well done comedy. 
user2: What is your favorite character?
user1: gru i think but i love steve and bob minion 
user1: how about you?
user2: Gru is my favorite too. I'm a big Steve Carell fan.
user1: yea me too he was wonderful in the office but he plays a  lovable villain 
user2: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?
user1: i did today most  rating are tanks buy a few low reviews  and i think this movie at 81% rotten tomatoes says a ton of different people like it 
user1: what do you think about the rating 
user2: I agree with it
user2: Do you usually watch animated movies?
user1: with two kids i have seen a ton of them willing or not  lol
user2: Fair enough
user1: i like suspense but the animated movie are funny so i dont mind 
user2: I thought the character of Vector was annoying
user1:  the concept of trying to steal the moon was cool but vector did come off as a bad character 
user2: The girls are what really make the movie fun though. They drive the story forward and make it interesting
user1: the girls trying to get in the fortress of vector with girl scoot cookie played well
user1: and the stuffed unicorn was cute
user2: yes, I like the theme park scene
user1: yea i enjoy the adoptions of the girls it hit home my the boys being adopted themselves 
user2: Yes, that's a very sweet part of the movie
user2: The idea of stealing the moon is certainly unique.
user1: i think so too it was a bit like honey i shrunk the kids  but really fun to watch
user2: Yeah
user2: It made for an interesting ending
user1: i didnt realize Russell brand was the voice of  Dr. nefario until today
user1: yes the end was well done
user2: Oh, I didn't realize that either
user2: That was an interesting character too
user1: i guess he is betterwith voices than i thought. i thought he was more slap stick
user1: well it was nice chatting with you  have a good day
user2: I'm not that familiar with that actor
user2: Thanks, you too

conversation:
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user1: The movie is Despicable Me released in 2010.  
user2: What is the movie about?
user1: It's an animated comedy targeted at children, but based upon the 81% Rotten Tomatoes score adults have enjoyed it too.
user2: What genre would you say it fits into?  Comedy?
user2: Who are the lead voice actors or actresses?
user1: It features a supervillain Gru, although he refers to himself as Despicable Me, Gru's archenemy, Victor "Vector" Perkins and an elderly man in the employ of Gru, the friendly scientist. The movie is definitely a comedy. 
user1: Steve Carell is the voice actor for Gru, Jason Segel voices Victor Perkins, and Russell Brand voices Dr. Nefario (the aforementioned friendly scientist).
user2: Have you watched this movie?
user1: Yes and I found it quiet amusing.  It seems as though Pixar succeeded when they released this movie.
user2: How long is the runtime of this movie?
user1: I'm unsure of how long the movie is.  The first scene of the movie sets the stage for all that follows.  Gru learns that a villian, Vector but Gru learns this later, stole the Great Pyramid of Giza.  This leads to have the desire to on up Vector by stealing the Moon!
user2: Would you be willing to watch this movie again?
user2: Is this a "G" rated movie?
user1: But alas, Gru doesn't have the money required so he is required to seek assistance from the Bank of Evil by means of a loan. The Bank President agrees to provide Gru with the required money if he obtains the shrink ray used to steal the Pyramid.  She reveals that Vector was the villian behind the Pyramid theft, which sparks Gru's rivalry with Vector.  I would be willing to watch the movie again and although the document does not state it has a G rating, it is targeted at young children, so I would presume it does.
user1: I would advise you check online to confirm the G rating though.
user2: Would you consider the ending to be a happy ending?
user1: As Gru came to car for three young girls he adopted - Margo, Edith, and Agnes - I would say it ends happy for Gru.
user2: That is all I really need to know.
user1: In fact, Gru came to realize he was beginning to care for the girls when he became conflicted, since their dance recital interfered with his plans to steal the moon.
user1: Although that was Gru's first truly human moment, it was nearly spoiled by the dastardly Dr. Nefario, when he attempted to have the girls returned to the orphanage (and to think he was supposed to be a good guy - for a movie about supervillians).
user2: Is this chat ever going to end?
user1: One more document to go... and it should loud after this response.
user2: Wonderful
user1: One of my favorite scenes of the movies occurs immediately after Gru surrenders the Moon to Vector - Vector was holding the girls hostage.  Dr. Nefario discovers that the effects of the shrink ray are temporary and the length of time the object remains in it's shrunken state is inversely correlated to the size of the object.
user1: Thus, while the moon was aboard Vector's ship the moon begins to expand until it explodes out of his ship reclaiming its position among the stars
user2: Well it seems you have told me the whole story.  I don't even need to watch the movie now.
user1: But I haven't even told you where most of the comedy arises, the Gru's Minions!
user1: Albeit you are correct, that is essentially the entire movie.
user1: What remains: You reply, me, you and we're done.
user2: Thank you for sharing.  That was more than enough information.  Are we done yet?
user1: Nearly, I do feel like adding that Gru did wind up showing up to the girls recital, which is when he realized they were kidnapped by Vector.
user2: How do we finish the conversation?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello! have you ever seen the movie dispicable me?
user1: It has a really great score on rotten tomatoes, I highly recommend it!
user2: Yes
user2: I have seen parts of it
user2: but not the whole movie
user2: What is the roten tomatoes score?
user1: I really think that Steve Carell is does an amazing job play Gru, Gru is my favorite character.
user2: Who is the director?
user1: The rotten tomatoes score is 81 percent.
user2: Yes I think the animated characters are cute
user2: The critical response to the movie was positive too
user1: It was made in a French animation studio which is pretty surprising to me
user2: The cast is awrsome
user2: Steve Carell and Russell Brand are two very well known actors and they sounded great 
user1: I think that it is really funny that in retaliation Gru decides he wants to steal the moon to be better than the unknown supervillan who stole the great pyramid
user2: Yes it is funny  
user1: Although I know that it is part of the plot that Gru and Vector have a rivalry, I think it would be interesting if they had worked together instead
user2: The kids and adults will definitely like this movie
user1: Yeah it is a very kid friendly movie
user2: Well thry shouldnt have because Gru is a super villain
user1: I think it is sad that Gru decided he wanted to give the girls back to the orphanage first because of their dance receital
user2: Bahah the names in this animation are hilarious because Gru goes to the Bank of Evil to steal the moon well to get money to steal the moon
user2: funny
user2: The names themselves are comical 
user1: Yeah the names are very funny, I like the bank of evil lol
user2: awww yes that is sad
user2: he should have kept them :(
user1: Although one of my favorite parts of the movie is when they go to the theme park, so adorable1
user2: Yes
user2: I lobe those scenes they are so fun
user2: and keep me engaged
user1: I think it is hilarious when the moon goes back to its original size in Vectors ship and forces him to be stuck on the moon
user2: but they get kidnapped by Vector hpw scary
user1: yeah but then it proves that Gru really does want them because he goes to save them, really makes for a happy and funny ending with Vector getting stuck in orbit
user2: Yes  
user2: a good ending is always welcome
user2: Did they every think he didnt care?
user1: So all in all what is your most favorite part of the movie?
user2: I like the theme park scene
user1: I think that the girls probably felt that he didn't care about them, but then was relieved that he came to save them
user2: what is your favorite part of the movie?
user2: Ok we are done here. Have a nice day!

conversation:
user1: Morning!
user2: Hello! Afternoon here!  
user2: So I am supposed to tell you all about the movie Despicable Me.
user2: It's an animated movie from 2010, starring Steve Carell, Jason Segel and Russell Brand.  It has a rotten tomatoes score of 81%, which is pretty great.
user2: You have to talk back to me so we can move on :)

conversation:
user2: Hi have you seen this movie?
user1: Hi, No i havent seen this movie 
user1: you?
user2: Do you watch many animated movies?
user2: No me either,
user1: Not really
user1: Did you know the director of this movie?
user2: Are you surprised by the ratings the movie got? No don't know the director.
user1: honestly yes a bit surprised, they seems to high for me
user2: Interesting I thought maybe they were a bit low I know people with kids that raved about this movie.
user1: I only have heard bad things about this movie due to the "Minions"
user1: people seem to not like them 
user2: Really? 
user2: I don't personally care for the evilness in this movie I wouldn;t want my kids watching it.
user1: Honestly i believe the same, i woulnd't want too 
user1: there are better movies for sure
user2: Yeah it has stealing and evil bankers and supervillains. Not good for kids in my opinion. Definitely better movies out there.
user1: Did you read the key scene number 2? there you can see how ambicious is Gru and his minions
user1: starting a rilvalry without any real causes, just their egos and their plans
user2: what do you think about the 3 girls roles? Yes actually I was just reading that.
user1: its not like that a person like Gru can adopt girls even if he "save" them from the orphanage its not like he is a good example for the girls
user1: right?
user2: Exactly. It's sad that they are in the middle of it and being part of everything going on.
user1: definetly not a good movie to watch for kids, thats why i said that the rating was to high
user2: It doesn't mention much about the minions. Wonder what their role in this movie is?
user2: I agree!
user1: They act like soldiers
user1: they just obey everything for the right prize
user2: Kidnappings and stealing the moon and such. Yes agree with you!
user1: What do you think about Vector being trapped into the orbit?
user1: do you find it fair? was he really a bad human being?
user1: human beging*?
user2: From what it says I suppose he was. Fair I don't believe so but I guess this movie is all about judging.
user1: I agree with you! its all about judging sadly 
user2: I wonder of the girls change Gru or if he causes them to be like him.
user2: if
user2: I find this movie to just be sad. It  may have amusing parts to it but over all it's a sad movie!
user1: I think that he would cause them to be like him.. maybe they can change Gru but unfortunately we dont have enough information in the text
user1: I totally agree, pretty sad overall and with plenty of flaws and bad vibes
user2: True I would hope that good would overcome evil in this movie but it's doubtful.
user2: Yes bad vibes, totally agree!
user1: Thats why this movie becomes famous, because it isnt a regular movie for kids like the others
user1: probably this movie have a bad ending with evil winning
user2: True. It teaches everything a child should not be taught.
user2: Probably! 
user1: Also did you like the Dr Nefrio character? did he seems interesting to you?
user1: Nefario*
user2: From the info the only good in this movie were the girls and Dr. Nefario the friendly scientist and it doesn't seem like he was talked about much.
user1: Totally true
user2: It would have been nice to seen more from him I think.
user1: Yeah agree
user1: do you have more question regarding the movie?
user2: No not really
user1: Me neither
user2: ok thanks for the chat
user1: was a nice talk! goodbye and have a nice day

user2: Hello!
user1: helloW
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: I don't remember I think so
user1: this is interesting to see it was a french movie in some way
user1: did you learn anything from the paragraph?
user2: Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed!  It felt very American to me.
user1: all the actors are :)
user2: Hmm, to be honest, I knew about most of the details already, and had forgotten about the French angle.
user2: The Pharrell songs were excellent.
user1: it's 3?
user1: oh I just got a second page to read
user2: I wonder why all the pull quotes are positive, when the ratings aren't that high?
user1: the ratings are quite good on my page
user1: it says Rotten Tomatoes 81%
user2: I have 81% with 6.8 out of 10.
user1: well maybe it's because it is a comey?
user2: I wonder about that missing 3.2, though...
user1: comedy
user1: ah ah yes
user2: Yeah, comedies are critically underrated.
user2: Good point.
user1: is the page updating for you too?
user1: ohhh it is the movie with the Minions 
user1: now I remember yes I have seen that one ahah
user2: Yep, I got an update too.
user2: And another one.
user1: yes I think it is talking about the story
user2: Yeah, look how detailed they're getting!
user1: did you have favorite characters?
user2: Well, Gru was fun.
user1: I like the minions
user2: I could relate to the oldest daughter most.
user2: The minions were hilarious.
user1: right?
user2: I still don't know how some of them only have one eye...
user1: ah ah true
user2: I blame Gru!
user1: hee hee
user1: it says we can finish the conversation 
user2: Cool!  Enjoyed chatting with you.
user1: the window changed 
user1: me too! 
user1: good luck!!
user2: You too!

conversation:
user2: Hello, have you seen the movie Despicable Me?
user1: no, never saw it. any good?
user2: It was quite cute! Created by Illumination Entertainment in 2010, the main story follows an aging Supervillian named "Gru."  Gru has a posse of "minions" who do the heavy lifting for him.  
user1: It has a funny title. 
user1: so i guess Gru is despicable?
user2: It does: but, it's appropriate.  One of the central conflicts in the film revolves around Gru's perception of himself.  As the "super villian", he sees himself as a "despicable" person. However, during the course of the movie, you see that he actually has a very big heart
user2: He ends up adopting three girls and learns to parent creatively and ends up choosing "his girls" over the chance to be the bigger villain on earth.
user1: Is it an animation?
user2: Yes!  And, a well crafted one, at that.  It was produced by Universal.   It's obviously digitally animated.  More along the lines of Pixar movies.  And, the soundtrack is amazing.
user1: Interesting. is it kid friendly?
user2: Very much so!  But, as a bonus, there are some clever inside jokes that play to parents and grandparents.  It's definitely appropriate for a family movie night.   The overall theme is the importance of family and teaamwork.
user2: Steve Carrel does some amazing voice work, as the main character.
user1: Ah that sounds good...though I wouldn't mind seeing this plot with Catwoman in the lead
user1: What tunes are in the soundtrack that u mentioned.
user2: I'm not sure Cat Woman would fit well, in this case.  Really, It pokes fun at the concept of super villains and the  stereotypical "crimes" they often pursue.   Gru, in this movie, wants to steal the moon...but is foiled by another up-and-coming super villain.  In the end, he ends up giving the moon to his girls...which is  a cute stereotype of a good father.
user2:  Pharrel wrote the main theme song and performs it: the lyrics are peppy and comical.  There are other contemporary and classical pieces that help weave the narrative together.
user1: wow...that really sounds original. never seen anything like that
user2: It is an original concept, for sure.  If you tend towards an appreciation for silly humor, the minions have  you covered. They often get themselves into very Rube-Goldberg-esque shennanigans.
user1: I liked Monsters ( the movie). in it the monsters are under the bed, but turn out to be friendly. Great movie to take the kids to. 
user2: It received numerous, positive reviews. I would recommend seeing it.  Kids will definitely like it.8
user1: Any superheros?
user2: Well, that's the take away- being a super hero or a super villain is entirely your choice. Gru ends up being a super hero by vanquishing Vector (the up-and-coming villain).
user2: So, would you go see this movie?
user1: Sometimes I think my kids will choose the latter. I need to indoctrinate the better.
user1: Yeah. gotta organize a movie night for it. popcorn, etc.
user1: did u see it with kids, btw?
user2: Sounds like a good plan.  Make sure you have bananas- the minions like them.
user2: Yes, I saw the movie with my children.
user1: They liked it?
user2: They loved it.  They spent the next few days speaking in "minion speak".  
user1: uh-oh
user2: It's not a bad thing.  Have you ever listened to kids try to speak pig latni?

conversation:
user1: Hello have you sceene the movie despicable me?
user2: Yes I have. Have you?
user1: Yes i have i have to say its a unique blend of funny and serious which is very hard to pull of what part did you like the most?
user2: I guess I liked all the scenes with Gru in it. He was my favourite character including the minions. Who was your favourite character?
user1: Vector and doc nerfario what didnt you like about it?
user2: That is was too short, it could have been ab bit longer. Do you know what rotten tomato rating it got?
user1: 81% and average 6.8 out of 10 what was one of the cirtical responses you responded well with?
user2: Thats not bad. I can’t remember who directed this movie, do you know?
user1: It had two directorsl pierre coffin and chris renaud do you remember if it was animated stop action or live action?
user2: I think it was an animated live action. Animated by the French animated studio Mac Guff. Do you remember when it was released?
user1: 2010 its not live animated its computer animated 
user2: Silly me. What was the main plot of the movie again?
user1: Were onto the next movie which you have, the plot was of gru a super villian turned good guy whoe tried to steal the moon and took in three orphans
user2: What is the next movie? Steve Carell is awesome in this, I wonder where he gets he’s inspiration from.
user1: Scroll down on there idk the next page is blank for me.
user2: Me too. I guess we can keep talking about Despicable me then.
user2: Do you remember the scene when Gru and the girls arrive at Vector’s fortress?

conversation:
user1: Hey!
user2: Hi 
user1: Did you get a document?
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me ?
user1: Yes!
user1: Have you?
user1: What's it about?
user2: I have! It is a cartoon kids movie that focuses on the villian turned good guy
user1: Which is a really good family movie
user1: How long is it?
user2: I think they hit a homerun with allowing adults to enjoy it as well as the kids 
user1: I agree.
user2: I do not know exactly how long the  movie is
user1: I love when they do that with any movie
user1: Ah, okay
user1: Who voices the characters?
user2: Steve Carell voice Gru
user1: he's so funny
user2: Jason Seqel as Vector
user1: that's awesome
user1: ahh
user2: They are both so funny
user1: they are!
user1: does it have a good soundtrack?
user2: The double villian is a fun play on the story
user1: lol agreed
user2: I like how they have him adopt the girls as well, adds something relatable for adopted kiddos 
user2: and families
user1: oh yeah it does! I never thought about that
user1: very relatable to a lot of different audiences for sure
user2: agreed
user2: They also show a tough mans softer side by showing him attend the dance recital 
user1: yes!!
user1: it's so sweet
user1: well, that about that wraps it up. THanks you!
user1: Hope you have a wonderful day :)
user2: thank you !
user2: You too! 
user1: bye
user2: cheers to the MINIONS OF COURSE
user1: oh yes of course!! they make the movie lol
user2: no one care argue that 

conversation:
user2: you should really watch Despicable me it is a 3D masterpiece
user1: Hmm what is it about?
user2: Its about a supervillian
user2: its amusing
user1: ahh okay. is it a kids movie or more geared towards adults?
user2: good for both kids and adults smart humor
user1: ohh I love humor 
user1: how long would you say it is
user2: I'm not certain
user1: oh okay. what would you say your favorite part of the movie is?
user2: The animation
user1: ah okay 
user2: I like when the great pyramid is stolen
user1: what else can you tell me about it?
user2: The Minions are really cute
user2: there is a shrink ray
user1: lol are the minions the supervillian?
user2: no 
user1: what is a shrink ray? 
user2: a think that shrinks things
user2: one of the supervillians tries to steal it
user1: I see and does the supervillian use this as a weapon? or does the good guy use it?
user1: ooo so its used by the good guys?
user2: the good guys and bad guys part is confusing
user2: Gru (supervillian) shrank the moon
user1: oh I mean I would assume that there is a good guy and a bad guy . . . as in the supervillian is the bad guy and someone is trying to make sure he is isnt taking over?
user1: ooo dear that sounds intense
user2: but had to give the moon to his rival Vector
user2: to save "the girls"
user1: ahh okay and is Vector a supervillian too? 
user2: vector is an up and comming villian
user1: ahh interesting so the movie is about two villians?

user2: Yes

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hi
user1: did you like the movie?
user2: I think it is a so so movie. Some of the parts are funny. What about you?
user1: I like the animation of the movie, very well done.
user1: The characters are all unique looking
user2: Agree. 
user2: The ratings is good too. 81% is pretty high
user1: It is an okay score, i think
user1: Steve carrel is a good choice for the main character
user2: Yeah. Most of the movies I like get a lower score than that. 
user2: Yes. He did great
user1: I did not like the Vector character
user1: what do you think about him?
user2: He is an excellent villain I think. Funny too
user1: I wish he had more screentime
user2: I agree. 
user2: I like Dr. Nefario. He remains me of my grandpa
user1: haha he is a funny character
user2: yes lol. I like the scene when he went to steal the shrink ray
user1: What do you think about the orphan girls?
user2: They are super cute, my favorite is the youngest one
user1: ah, i think she is kind of annoying
user2: most toddler that age are I think 
user1: haha, but they are all unique, which is nice
user1: I like that Gru deals with their antics
user2: yes. he is a sweet guy
user1: Maybe not so evil after all?
user1: haha 
user2: When he went to see the recital I think that is a sweet scene
user2: yes lo;l
user1: that is very sweet!
user1: he choose them over himself

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi there!
user1: Do you usually like 3D animated movies?
user2: Yes, love them. What do you think about Despicable me?
user1: I rather liked it. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was still good.
user2: I like it too. Funny and heart warming at the same time.
user1: Gru was a really interesting character, too. I liked Steve Carell and the the voice he used for Gru.
user2: Yes, he did an excellent job portraying the character.
user2: 81% in ratings I think is great too
user1: I feel that's pretty appropriate for how good the movie was. It was so enjoyable!
user2: Agree.  Dr. Nefario is quite funny too
user1: I didn't remember Russell Brand being the actor for him, but it makes sense...
user1: How did you like the Minions? Are you a Minion fan?
user2: Yeah, I don't even have clue that it was him. 
user2: I am. I have a cellphone case with minions in it
user2: What about you?
user1: I think they look really strange, but definitely add more comedic value to an already funny movie. I just wonder where they came from.
user1: It's weird how the girls are not mentioned in the cast, the intro, or the first key scene of the movie. They're rather important.
user2: Love how they talk, it is really funny. I also wonder how the writer came up with the idea
user2: Yeah I agree. What do you think about the siblings?
user1: When you said it was heartwarming, I feel like most of it came from them. I also think they were really good for Gru,
user1: He definitely needed an opportunity to show he was a deeper character than just stealing things.
user2: Yes. The recital made me cried
user2: The reason why he wants to steal the moon is pretty deep too. It was his mom's fault why he became a bad guy I think
user1:  I remember something about his mom but can't remember exactly how she played into it.
user1: It's good that in the end Gru cares more for his new adopted children than for the original goal of the moon.
user2: She kind of ignore him when he was young.
user1: Regardless of that he couldn't keep the moon anyway.
user2: Ikr. It showed how he cared about them when Vector kidnapped the girls

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello. 
user2: I saw this movie but it was geared towards younger people, have you seen it?
user1: What movie are you referring to?
user2: Despicable me
user1: Actually I've seen none of those movies.  I'm not even sure what they're about.  All I know is it has those little yellow minions.
user2: Yes that is the one
user1: What's it about?
user2: It has Steve Carrell though which means I will probably like it
user1: I like Steve Carrell for the most part.
user2: He is always funny in The Office
user2: Do you plan on seeing this movie?
user1: Probably just because I have 2 little girls, so I end up watching more than my share of animated films.
user2: Understandable
user1: But what's the premise of the movie? 
user2: About a supervillain who is disheartened steals the Great Pyramid of Giza
user2: He can't steal it so he tries to buy it instead
user1: lol. That sounds a bit over the top ,but still kind of funny.
user2: He tries to steal the shrink ray and finally gets it
user1: Who is the main "hero(ine)
user2: What movies have you watched lately?
user2: Gru
user2: who is played by steve carrell
user1: He sounded more like a villian than a hero.  What do all those little yellow minions do? And does it say where they came from.
user2: They try to help Gru 
user2: but not for long as Gru cannot pay them
user1: Is there any leader of the minions?
user2: Gru is
user1: Sounds like a very unique move.
user1: *movie
user2: yes
user1: Is there anything else to the plot/storyline?
user2: well, gru tries to steal  the moon by shrinking it and succeeds

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi how are you
user1: I'm doing pretty good how about you?
user2: Doing good now that I have someone to talk with about this movie! How did you like Despicable Me?
user1: I think it was a pretty good movie overall. The critics rate it fairly high though. Do you think it got a fair score on Rotten Tomatoes?
user2: I'm not a fan of rotten tomatoes, they don't seem to give good movies proper credit. However I would say the score was fair enough. I think I would of gave it  a 6 too.
user1: Yeah that's probably where I'd put it. It was good but not amazing haha. How did you like Steve Carell voicing Gru?
user2: I love Steve Carell. I think he was a pretty good fit for the voice, especially considering this was a comedy. How did you like the animations?
user1: I liked him too, he was a great choice for the character. The animation was really good, not too cartoony but just enough, if that makes sense. How about you?
user2: I think it was pretty good. I really don't like 3d animated movies at all, but this one was different. It was pretty enjoyable. I agree with the not too cartoony aspect you said.
user2: What would you say you enjoyed mos about the film?
user1: Do you usually like animated movies?
user2: Not at all.
user2: Most of theme are way too goofy.
user1: I like watching cartoons and animated movies a lot. The plot of Despicable Me was kind of out there for me though, I know they were trying to overplay the evil villain plot but it was a little out there for me. I did like the minions and the girls tho.
user2: Yes, the minions by far where my favorite part of the film.
user2: I watch cartoons as well, but for some reason 3d animation just doesn't feel the same
user1: Yeah it does have a totally different feel to it. I thought it was clever that Gru had to get funding for his evil plan from the Bank of Evil
user2: Yeah, at least we know how it works on the evil villain side of things.
user2: How was the quality of jokes to you?
user2: I thought they were pretty solid for the kids and adults.
user1: They were alright, not great but good for everyone to laugh at I think. How did you like the personalities of the three girls?
user2: I think they where pretty typical overall. Nothing that hasn't been seen before, but the rest of the movie was able to distract me from that fact.
user1: I think they were pretty stereotypical to their roles right? Kind of exactly what you'd expect. They were sweet tho. 
user2: yeah, exactly but they are pretty likable characters overall. 
user2: I think the plot was a bit bad, but I've come to expect it from animation movies
user2: In fact, I think that is why I really don't pick up on these kinds of films. Simply because I know the plot will be lacking.
user1: I feel like they could have made them a little more relate able. Yeah the first time I saw it I really enjoyed it, I liked the soundtrack a lot. The second time I saw it I was not as pleased with the movie but still liked the music.
user2: Yeah, now that you mention it the music was pretty good.
user2: It's pretty up there on my list of most liked soundtracks.
user1: They really milked everything out of the minions since they were such a big hit after the movie though.
user2: I think they where the best part of the film, you couldn't help but laugh at every little thing that they did. I don't blame them at all for trying to milk them for all they are worth.
user1: My kids have never seen Despicable Me or any of the following movies but know what minions are. I agree they really added a lot to the movie. They were really fun. Would you say the minions were your favorite character in the movie?
user2: Yes, 100 percent without even thinking about it. I can recall almost every joke the minions said or did as opposed to the actual characters.
user1: That's awesome. I just vaguely remember any of the movie honestly. What was your favorite scene? Or favorite joke?
user2: what about you? who was your favorite ccharacter?
user1: I'd say the minions were my favorite too. And Gru's dogs thing lol
user2: Lol yeah the dogs where cool.
user2: I htink one scene I liked was when the girls were asking for pizza and one of the minions was with them
user2: the way he said "OOOO Stuffed crust" just made me laugh out loud.
user1: Awesome, thanks for chatting we can finish the conversation now! Take care.
user2: See you@

conversation:
user1: Did you think the movie was funny?
user2: I did, not only was it funny it had a good message, don't you think?
user2: Do you usually like animated movies?
user1: Yeah! It was enjoyable for all ages.
user1: It's about 50/50 for me. It depends on how developed the plot is.
user2: I agree. Fortunately the movie had a good plot. Do you agree with its various ratings? Including, the low in my opinion, 72 metacritic score
user1: I disagree with its rating too!
user1: Sure it's a simple movie, but the creative background was very strong - and everyone who saw it loved it!
user2: People of all ages love this movie, me included. Steve Carrell did a phenomenal job voicing Gru. 
user1: The cast did some spot on voice work!
user1: And Russel Brand as the Dr, you would've never expected it
user1: Did you see it in 3D?
user2: I didn't get a chance to see it in 3D
user2: Why did you leave the chat?

conversation:
user1: Have you ever seen this movie?
user2: Yes I have seen despicable Me before.  Have you?  
user1: I have not seen the movie but I love the daily cartoons of the minions.
user1: What did you think of it?
user2: I hadn't seen the cartoons but if u like the cartoons you will love the movies!  But I don't like the movies personally. Just not my type of movie. 
user1: So you didn't like the movie?
user1: Is it all about villians?
user2: No I didn't it was a good movie but not a movie I cared for.  I think u will like it though the minions are cute
user1: I liked her since the run away bus movie. Lol
user1: What does she play in this?
user1: The stealing the moon and the shrink ray sound pretty far fetched even for kids.
user2: Yes it's about a villains and I'm not sure but Steve Carell played the role of Victor
user2: The movie was rated 81% on rotten Tomatoes
user1: who is the hero?
user2: Ultimately it was the kids so stopped Victor from shrinking everything with a shrink ray. 
user1: How cute.  I thought it was only minions.  Was Sandra a minion?
user2: The movie has a score of 71/100 so I guess a lot of people liked it. I think she was one of the kids.  It has minions and of curse evil Victor and 3 kids that are related that he adopted for his evil plan but he ends up falling in love with them and they help him not to be so evil. 
user1: Oh I just read about the orphan girls. What a sweet sweet touch!
user1: This may be a movie that I can stream.
user2: Yes it came out in 2010 so u should be able to stream it.  The orphan girls where not wanted by anyone but victor
user1: Aww I can see why they did a sequel.
user2: The girls where cute
user1: The ending sounds really cute also.
user1: The moon back in place and the villian with it
user2: The sequal I found was better.  Yes the ending was sooo funny and was all thanks to the kids!  
user1: You make me want to watch it.. Thanks for sharing with me!
user2: Your welcome you should definitely see it
user1: I will
user2: This was a good movie to talk about for this task 
user1: What was the second movie about?

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user1: What did you think of the movie?
user2: hello 
user2: i personally loved this movie and thought steve carell was great in it
user1: I agree
user1: What did you think of Jason Segel?
user1: Do you like animation movies?
user2: LOL ... i loved him too ... but gru really made the movie for me.  Steve really gave him a lot of personality
user2: I think it was the fact that even though it was animation it was all the adult inuendo that made me laugh 
user1: Definitely
user1: There is a good mix of adult and kid things to keep everyone happy
user1: Just like the last reviewer says
user2: wish i had seen the 3D version i bet that would have been incredible really
user1: Yeah, I didn't see the 3D version either
user1: Typically 3D doesn't impress me very much
user2: i can't see in 3D i am blind in one eye LOL.  This movie was a feather in Pixar's cap for sure
user1: Definitely, I think the ratings are pretty accurate except for Metacritic, that seems low
user2: i don't even know what that one means ... but i can't believe rotten tomatoes only gave it 81% not that it isn't a good rating i understand 
user1: I'd never heard of this director before
user2:  me either but then i am not very saavy with names ... of directors
user2: i didn't know russell brand was dr nefario either
user1: That's pretty funny that Gru wanted to abandon the girls at the amusement park.
user2: that was pretty funny ... and in the end he ended up with his face pained .... 
user1: Yep, that was nice that he warmed up to the girls.
user1: And then they offered up their own money to help him out, how sweet.
user1: What did you think of Dr. Nefario arranging for the girls to be returned to the orphanage?
user2: i was cracking up when gru thought to impress Mr Perkins by shrinking one of the minions 
user1: And it was even more impressive that he actually shrunk the moon.
user2: i was so mad at dr nefario .... ugh ... but then i guess you had to have someone to get angry with in the movie 
user1: Too bad he had to give it to Vector!
user1: There must be some sort of disagreement to move the plot along...
user2: yes but so funny when it enlarged in his ship and was like a giant marble rolling around 
user1: Talk about causing problems!
user1: It's a good thing the Minions came to the rescue
user2: it was awesome the way gru saved the girls on his lil "tight rope" and then you are right the way they came to the rescue when gru had to catch the last girl ... i'm a sucker for a sappy save
user1: Def!
user1: It didn't end well for Vector
user2: no it sure didn't but you have to admit his squid gun was pretty inventive
user2: and his pet shark was pretty cool
user1: Squid launcher
user1: Gotta reload
user1: Too funny
user2: and he had another gun too ... piranha wasn't it ? 
user1: Ah, yeah, I think so
user1: Still not as good as Gru's Freeze Ray
user2: and Mr Perkins being his dad LOL .. that took the cake ... and watching him shrink the bathroom fixtures was hysterical .. of all the rooms to shrink things in ... 
user1: Curse you tiny toilet
user2: that is so true ... the freeze ray is funny as heck
user1: Good talking with you
user2: nice chatting with you also ... i loved the pink space suit and the recital at the end ...
user2: i can't believe we are done already LOL .. have a great day
user1: you too

user2: Yeah
user1: so let me guess, the movie is the one with those weird yellow creatures too?
user2: Good for kids attention spans but deep enough to have a good amount of plot twists and character development.
user2: Exactly, the "Minions" are very marketable
user1: plot twists, loool, well Im still not convinced because it has those 'Minions' ... Ugh.
user1: what kind of rating would you give the movie/
user1: ?
user1: Out of 10 stars
user2: Yeah, they grow on you. They even have their own follow up movie sequel.
user2: I like animated movies and I would say it is an 8/10.
user1: Grow on you, lool. Yeah I've seen the trailers for their movie sequel. 
user2: I could watch it with my kids, but I did prefer UP or the classic Disney movies.
user2: Do you have a favorite animated movie that you like? 
user1: I like animated movies too, more adult oriented but maybe i will try out despicable me. it has a lot of sequels too
user1: Yeah my favourite would have to be maybe Aladdin or Akira
user1: I 'm not the biggest fan of 3D Movies but when they first came out of course they were awesome
user2: yeah, Aladdin was really good and I do like the Miyazaki films.
user2: But I'm not too harsh a critic and if have the time will watch most movies if they have decent reviews.
user1: heck yeah hayao miyazaki is awesome. gotta love kiki and the castle in the sky and of course spirited away
user1: i like TV series a lot more than movies because they are like ongoing stories
user1: you notice many tv series coming out on netflix (if you have netflix)?
user2: yeah, and the classic Totoro is iconic
user2: I do. Netflix releases so many new shows every month it is unbelievable.
user1: Yeah. I think it's great they are releasing many foreign tv shows, so we can get a good idea of shows in other countries
user2: Back to this movie I love the girls, scripting and comic relief with their facial expressions and dialog.
user1: Yeah i've seen some of the trailers and the animators really put a lot of emotion and expression into each character
user1: Certainly despicable me has some good character designs too.
user2: But I do like Steve Carrell from the "Office" tv show as one of my favorites, right up there with Friends.
user2: So I may be a bit biased to the movie rating.
user1: Oh yeah the office is great!
user1: ohhh we can finish convo, time to get that dough. Good to talk to another m turk worker!!!
user2: you too, thanks.

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: Let's talk about the movie Despicable Me
user1: Okay. I really liked Steve Carell as the main character.
user2: I did too. I thought he was loveable. 
user2: I also didn't realize the film was animated by a friend studio I always thought it was Pixar
user2: french*
user1: For a debut film from a production company, they really knocked it out of the park
user1: So did I.
user1: It really has been one of the first animated films to focus on the villain as a main character
user2: I agree, I don't recall any other moves to focus on the villain the way they do in Despicable Me. 
user2: My kid definitely dug it, and I smiled with amusement a lot throughout
user1: Same. I never realized that Russell Brand was Dr. Nefario either
user2: I didn't realize that either. I did recognize Jason Segel though
user1: I wonder what the interest rate would be from the Bank of Evil.
user2: Hm, not sure. 
user2: I'm not getting the second page of the discussion here. 
user1: I'm surprised it only got a rating of 6.8/10 from Rotten Tomatoes, too
user1: Yeah, all I'm getting are the Key Scenes at the top
user2: Yes, I thought it was better than 6.8
user2: I guess it wasnt reall a first rank CGI cartoon, but I thought the quality of the story made it better 
user1: Yeah, I guess you're right
user2: There were teary bits for sure
user1: I loved the Pharrell sound track though
user2: The storyline of the stealing of the moon was pretty unique
user1: Yeah, some of them will tug on your heartstrings.
user1: I didn't remember Vector being trapped on the Moon after it returned to original size either
user2: I loved how Gru warmed up to the girls. I don't remember Vector being trapped on it either. I guess I focused more on the storyline with the girls
user1: Out of all of the things to steal, the Moon would be pretty evil
user2: Yes it would
user1: Yeah, that's what happens when you are a parent. My kid's not old enough to enjoy it yet but I'm sure she will someday
user2: She will probably enjoy the three girls and their story
user2: But the orphanage scenes might make her sad
user1: And hopefully laugh at the minions
user2: Yes, the minions are my son's favorite
user1: The orphanage scenes make me sad so I don't doubt it
user1: Well, I think thats about it
user2: me too

conversation:
user2: Good morning, how are you today?
user1: Great, yourself
user2: good, thanks!
user2: Have you seen this animation?
user1: Not sure, what is the name of the movie
user2: Despicable Me
user2: with minions in it
user1: No, what year is the movie
user2: 2010
user1: Kind of old
user1: Who are the main characters
user2: You should definitely see it-if you have kids they will really enjoy this(all ages) and it's really funny for adults as well!
user1: I love comedy films
user2: There is a supervillain Gru 
user1: And what is Gru objective or plans
user2: and his helper Dr Nefario with his trusty Minions-who are super funny
user2: they want to steal and shrink the moon
user1: Okay, sounds interesting and funny at the same time
user2: and the good guy Victor-with hilarious Transylvanian accent-tries to stop this
user1: Is it Gru or Dr Nefario who wants to shrink the mon
user2: both of them-Gru is the boss and Nefario is his side kick
user1: So Victor is the good guy I see
user2: Yes, there is an emotional story here too
user2: he is a geek and a loner
user2: and suddenly comes to adopt three orphaned girls
user2: who really come to love him!
user2: which is very touching and sweet!
user1: Sounds like a good story with an emotional twist
user1: How are the reviews
user2: yes, they even made despicable me II and there is a minions movie!
user2: So if you want to get good laughs this is a great animation with both, kids and adult humor!
user2: 6.8 /10 on Rotten tomatoes but I would give it much higher!
user1: It must have been a really good film for them to have sequels 
user1: Kind of low ratings
user2: It really is, kids are still obsessed with these minions!
user1: Thanks for the insight
user1: I will see this movie
user1: Have  a great day
user2: no problem, you should! You too!
user1: Thanks

conversation:
user2: hi what movie are we talking about?
user1: Despicable Me
user2: oh nice, whats that about?
user1: It is a cute movie staring steve Carell, Jason Segel and Russell Brand so you know it will be funny
user2: yea it has to be then, whats the plot?
user1: It is animation about a villain who defeats another villain in the plot to take over the world
user2: oh animated movie...I like those. Do you know if it has a long run time?
user1: No I do not however it has a CinemaScore of A
user2: Oh that sure is a good rating. When did it come out?
user1: It came out in 2010.  Directed by pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud
user2: oh nice. Do you know if it has a good soundtrack? 
user1: It does have music by Pharrell on the soundtrack
user2: oh pretty big name. Did it do prettygood in box office sales?
user1: I am unsure however it is about a rivalry with 2 villains over a stolen Pyramid of Gyza
user2: wow, how did he steal the Pyramid?!
user1: A shrink ray
user2: whats something else that's fun about the movie?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hey

conversation:
user1: Hi there!
user2: Hi! Have you seen the movie Despicable Me?
user2: I'm a big Steve Carrel fan so I really liked it myself.
user1: No, I have not. What's it about?
user1: I like Steve Carrell too, he's funny!
user2: He voices the main character. It's a 3d animated movie.
user1: Nice, I enjoy animated movies. 3D seems cool too. Was the movie well-received? 
user2: It got pretty good reviews. It also had a few other pretty big named comedians in it.
user1: Nice, who else that I might know?
user2: Russell Brand and Jason Segel are also voice actors. It's a
user1: Cool! I like those guys, super funny. Can you tell me a bit more about the movie? What's it about?
user2: Actually it's a great movie for kids and adults. Main character Gru(Steve Carrel) plays a super villain.
user2: It's the movie where the minions were first introducd.
user1: Whoa, so a villain movie that's good for kids? That's interesting! These guys are comedians -- is it a funny movie?
user2: Yes. It's funny and Gru is not your typical Supervillain.
user1: Awesome. Why's that? What makes him different?
user2: He's downhearted because there is another Super who is outshining him.
user1: Ooh, so a little competition, eh! I like that. Sounds fun! What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: So he decides to  shrink the moon as the ultimate deed. But he has to have the shrinkray that his nenesis has. So while he's devising a plan some girlscouts show up to sell him cookies. He gets the idea he can use the girlscouts to get into the Fortress of the his Nemisis in order to steal the shrinkray and it just gets funnir from there.

conversation:
user2: Hello there...
user1: I think you should see Despicable Me!
user1: Hi, yourself!
user2: The first one, or one of the sequals?
user1: It's got Steve Carell as a Supervillian, and I know he's not everyone's cup of tea but Russell Brand plays his henchman
user1: The first one, from 2010
user2: It sounds pretty good, thanks for the recommendation. Have you seen any other movies that are good?
user1: I've seen a fair number of movies from the recent past, but I don't watch as many as I used to.  I think this exercise is supposed to be based on this document.  
user2: OK, I don't have the document on my end, is it all about Despicable Me?
user1: Check out some of these reviews :
user1: "Since villains so often steal the show in animation, Despicable Me smartly turns the wholeoperation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru."● "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and awickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D."● "Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any differentafterward than they were walking into the theater.● "Short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but belikable."● "It's no first-rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quality over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Fun, with teary bits, for kids; fresh and smart for adults."
user1: Yes, all about Despicable me
user2: Do you know who else is in it besides Steve Carell?
user1: Russell Brand and Jason segel
user1: that's all they give me
user1: I like that Despicable Me was directed by French director Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.
user2: I really like Jason Segel. What year did it come out?
user1: 2010, so still fresh enough
user1: You know it gets a healthy 81% fresh from rotten tomatoes
user1: I like segel too.  He's great in everything, especially despicable me.  He plays Gru's archenemy Vector
user2: Cool, I'm starting to like it more by the minute.
user1: What sort of emphasis do you put on movie ratings?  Critical response?  
user2: I tend to rely more on the actual people as opposed to critics. I also like to go to things that I know I will like.
user1: I'm sorry this HIT is just too wonky.  I think they'll pay you if I drop out and you wait 5 minutes
user2: It's going pretty good on my end.
user2: Sad to see you go.

conversation:
user1: HI
user2: Hi  have you seen Despicable Me?
user1: Yes I have! Such a cute movie.
user2: I love it and enjoy watching it again and again, the adult humor in it really makes it fun.
user1: For that reason, its a great movie for families. It offers comedy for all ages.
user2: Exactly it is perfect to watch with kids if you have any. Perfect for any group of people really.
user1: I nanny and I always choose that movie for the kids because I like it so much.
user2: I especially enjoy the actors that they get to play these voices, it really seems like they are having fun while doing it.
user1: I want a voice over job!
user1: Gru's voice would be difficult to create.
user2: Ha! That would be so much fun to do! 
user1: What is your favorite scene from the movie
user2: I laughed so hard when Dr. Nefario and his Minions shrink and steal the moon.
user1: My favorite scene is when the littlest girl got the stuffed unicorn!
user2: Now every time I look at the moon I think about doing that myself.
user2: I need to develop a shrink ray first though.
user1: Would you live in Gru's house? It looks creepy.
user2: I think it would be fun and nobody would come knocking on the door haha
user1: Also you would get to live with minions.
user2: That would be so much fun! 
user2: I love how even mean grumpy Gru started to warm up to the girls at the amusement park. 
user1: You would get into so much trouble with the minions.
user1: So heartwarming.
user2: Yeah I would be in trouble hanging with minions and be blamed for everything they do since I am the "adult"
user2: I was mad when Vector kidnapped the girls
user1: Just like having siblings lol!
user1: That stressed me out
user2: Yeah my siblings weren't that much fun like the minions would be
user1: I'd have to agree
user2: Gru thought he had the moon forever but the shrink ray wore off and it popped back to size and went back to it's place in the sky. All is well that ends well

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi there! The movie is a fairly new one, have you heard of Despicable me?
user2: I haven't. What is it about?
user1: Well it's an animated movie, so it is kind of geared towards kids but it's also family friendly

conversation:
user1: Hi, what movie will we be talking about?
user1: are you there?
user2: The movie is Despicable Me.

conversation:
user1: Hello, How are you doing today?
user2: Hi, did you like the movie Despicable Me?
user1: I thought it was a cute movie,You?
user2: Yeah, I liked the supervillian Gru.
user2: Did you like the gadgets Dr. Nefario created?
user1: Gru was a likable gut.
user1: guy
user1: They were interesting and funny, something like my grandpa would have done.
user1: Do you think the rating given is accurate?
user2: This was a good subject for 3D computer animation.
user2: I liked the humor infused into the movie, did you?
user1: I did, it had a little something for everyone I think.
user2: I think the rating is pretty accurate.
user1: What did you think of vector as a character?
user2: I liked his character, he contrasts well versus Gru.
user2: Did you like the scenes where the Shrink Ray is used?
user1: They were not my favorite parts of the movie but I get it was part of the story line
user2: What did you think of the Minions?
user1: I love those cute little yellow guys!
user1: they make me laugh even though I have no idea what they are saying.
user2: Yeah, they were pretty funny with their gibberish.
user1: I liked the little girls too. 
user1: And how determined they were.
user1: Did you have a favorite character?
user2: I like how the girls interrupt Gru's video meeting.
user1: It reminded me of something my girls would have done.
user2: My favorite character would be Gru, because of his gadgets.
user1: I liked that he had a soft side.
user2: Were you surprised that Vector was Perkins' son?
user1: A little, but it kind of explained a lot as to how he was able to get so much so young. Parents doing things for their kids.
user2: I liked the scene of the Moon gradually returning to normal size, did you?
user1: it was a plot twist, didn't see it coming.
user2: Yeah, and it's funny that Vector got stuck there.
user1: was amused that vector ended up on the short end of the stick.
user1: I guess it was one of those, you get what you play for type of things. :)
user2: Did you like the mid-air rescue of the girls?
user1: It was a little scary. I was hoping it was going to be successful.
user1: I had wondered if vector was going to end up keeping the girls.
user2: Did you like the use of 3D or was it too gimmiky?
user1: No I didn't think it was gimmiky, I liked it.

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you? 
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me yet? 
user1: I have not seen that movie.
user2: Steve Carell is the voice of Gru, the super villain. He fit the part so well. 
user2: It's a cartoon comedy. 
user1: Sounds fun, I am a Steve Carell fan.  He is good in The Office.
user1: Would you recommend seeing Despicable Me?
user2: I like him too. And Jason Segel plays his archenemy, Vector. I love Segel.
user2: I would, and if you have kids, it's a great kids movie to. Something the whole family can enjoy.
user1: Sounds like a good cast. 
user1: What is the story line?
user2: My youngest didn't really get it yet (but he's only 2) but my oldest thought it was funny. The story line was basically the two main characters and their funny interactions.
user2: Gru gets upset when someone steals the Great pyramid of Giza. 
user1: Sounds fun.  I do not have kids but a nephew that is around 2.  Do you think he would enjoy it?
user2: And he has to find someone to help him get it back. He ends up needing a loan, so he goes to the Bank of Evil.
user2: Turns out it was Vector that stole it, and they become rivals. 
user2: He may, but 2 is a little young for this one.
user2: Atleast in my opinion. 
user1: Good to know.  Aren't there a couple of the Despicable Me movies?  
user2: I think so. I am only familiar with this one.
user2: This one came out in 2010. 
user1: Oh wow.  I did not realize the movie had been out that long.
user2: I know! Time flies. I don't know when the others came out. The reviews were pretty good for the first. Had 81% on Rotten Tomatoes. 
user2: And Metacritic scored it 72/100.
user1: I know it was popular when it first came out.  I remember a lot of Halloween costumes about it.  What was your favorite scene in the movie?
user2: Hmm.. Let me think. 
user2: Maybe when Gru steals the shrink ray.
user2: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud directed it. 
user1: Would you say Gru is the best character?
user2: Yeah, but they're both good deep down, in my opinion.
user2: I need to watch it again, it's been awhile.
user1: I think it sounds interesting.  I am not usually an animated movie person but if it is funny enough I will watch.
user2: I wasn't either, but with kids now I have to be lol. 
user2: The part where Gru shrunk and stole the moon was also hilarious.
user1: It sounds like you found the movie to be quite funny.
user1: I think Monter's Inc was a pretty funny animated movie.  Would you say they are comparable?
user2: For an animated one. 
user2: Yeah, I would say so, but it's been so long since I saw that one too. 
user1: That is one that sticks with me for an animated movie.  

conversation:
user2: Do you believe this movie got the ratings it deserved?
user1: I think that it did. It had great actors for voice overs. What did you think of the movie?
user2: I thought it was rad, did you think steve carell was the right choice for Gru?
user1: I think Steve Carell is the right choice for any character. He's one of the few actors that if I see he's in a movie, I will go see it, no matter the ratings.
user1: Was there anything you didn't like about the movie?
user2: I didnt like that pierre coffin was a director, do you like him?
user1: I liked this movie. I would give other movies a chance based off of this film.
user2: Do you think adults like this film as much as children?
user1: I think adults will like the film as much as children. A lot of the humor in the movie is more so for adults to understand than kids would. Adults are able to enjoy the movie for the humor alone.
user1: Do you think the same actors will do the voices if there is another Despicable Me?
user2: I can agree with that, what did you think of victors voice actor?
user1: I thought his voice fit the character perfectly. What did you think of Russell Brand's performance?
user2: Russel did amazing, I really like other movies by him as well. Do you think its odd that the supervillian is the main character/
user2: ?
user1: No I love that about this movie.
user1: Do you think it would have been as good if the heroes were the main characters?
user2: No , I really enjoy the story! Were you surprised when the antogonist stole the great  pyramid of Giza?
user1: I was pleasantly surprised that they stole the pyramid. Do you like the minions that help Gru?
user2: Yes they are very cute, were you surprised Gru tried to steal the moon?
user1: No. He is always trying to one up his last heist. What's bigger than stealing the moon? Do you think the movie was better because it was in 3D?
user2: I cant watch 3d it gives me a headache, do you think a shrink ray would be applicable in real life?
user1: I believe anything is possible, so I believe it would be. Do you think Pharell was the right choice for the sound track?
user2: Yes his song fits for children and adults do you think the metacritic score was to low?
user1: I do think it was a little on the low side. I think it could have been rated a little higher. What about you?
user1: ?
user2: I think it couldve been rated higher, did you think it was a good idea for Gru to sell most of his possesions?
user1: I think the intentions of why he sold his belongings was good. What did you think?
user2: I do as well he did get a spaceship out of it, were you surprised he made it to the recital on time after stealing the moon?
user1: I was very surprised. It was a little bit of a tear jerking moment for me. Did you think that Gru would actually surrender the moon?
user2: yes I do, did you think the shrink rays effects would be temporary?
user1: I did think it would only be temporary.

conversation:
user1: Hello. Have you seen Despicable Me? It is a really fun animation movie that came out in 2010.
user2: Despicable me changed up the villian dynamic in animated movies
user2: I have seen it! My kids loved it
user2: Steve Carell is hilarious
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: No. But I would love to see the 3D computer-animated comedy.
user1: I guess it was the first film made by Illumination Entertainment.
user2: It was hilarious and so different than other animated films
user1: I understand the comedy is pretty funny, especially the villains. What did you find funny?
user2: Pharell did some of the music too
user1: Might be worth seeing the movie just to hear Pharrell.
user2: It is full of smart jokes that parents will catch but kids wont
user1: What did you think of the scene where Gru stole the Great Pyramid of Giza?
user2: Gru plans to steal and shrink the moon, another supervillian stole the pyramid
user2: The dynamic between two villians is great
user1: Sounds funny. It received a high rating from Rotten Tomatoes, 81 percent. Do you pay attention to the ratings?
user2: I don't usually on kids films, if my kids are interested, a rating won't deter them.
user2: Do you check out ratings before you see films?
user1: You are right about the plot. Sorry about that. 
user2: Oh no worries! I've seen it a bunch of times lol
user1: Sometimes I will read the critical response. I guess one critic said it had "whiplash-quick laughs." I like that kind of comedy.
user2: Seeing the 3 girls warm up to Gru (and he them) was really sweet too
user2: It reminds you that there is good in everyone, even an evil supervillian lol
user1: What did you think of Gru's rivalry with Vector?
user2: It was hilarious. I love Jason Segal, he holds his own with Carrell
user1: Russell Brand was probably good as well, do you think?
user2: The introduction of the minions is great too
user2: Brand plays Nefario and to be honest, I didn't realize it was him until the 3rd movie
user1: Do you like films of the animation genre? My kids are grown, but I still watch them!
user2: I do! I watched them even before I had kids
user2: The action scene with the rescue of the girls was good too. Intense but not too in your face like some of those Marvel movies.
user1: I was surprised that one critic said there were "teary bits" in the movie. Did you find that to be true?
user2: I did! Gru's relationship with the girls is very sweet.
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: Any scene with the minions. They are adorable and hilarious
user2: And when Agnes wins the unicorn at the amusement park
user2: IT IS SO FLUFFY!!!
user2: Have you seen any of the films by Chris Renaud?
user1: Do you know if Illumination Entertainment has come out with any other movies? 
user1: No, I haven't seen any films with Renaud. 
user2: Or and Illumination Entertainment movies?
user2: I know they do all the Despicable Me and Minion movies
user1: I just know about Pixar. I guess this film was animated by a French studio MacGuff (later became Illumination)
user2: I read that. I was really impressed that this was their first film.
user1: It's hard to believe it was released in 2010 and the minons still remain popular.
user2: I am not surprised, they are the best part of the film.
user2: Have you ever seen the minion movie?
user1: No, I haven't seen it. CinemaScore rated it an A. What would you give it?
user2: I would give it an A
user2: Do you think you will watch it after this?
user1: I haven't heard any negative critical response, other than it's amusing rather than funny, but that might not be construed as negative.
user1: I might rent it sometime if I need a good laugh.

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you doing today?
user1: good
user2: Have you seen this animation?
user1: Yes, I have seen Despicable Me.
user2: I think it's a very funny animation, my kids love it and we watched it so many times!
user1: It is surprising it came out in 2010. I never saw it in 3D
user2: I never saw it in 3 D either, I watched it on TV long after it came out
user1: Now I know why some of the Minions sound funny,  there was a French Animation studio.
user2: I think Victor character is pretty funny, love all the stunts and his funny accent!
user2: Minions are adorable!
user2: so is his pet-whatever creature that is!
user1: Yeah, the characters are pretty fun, kids love it
user2: And the whole adoption story with the three girls is very touching!
user1: Despicalbe Me somehow manages to make a supervillainn funny
user1: Gru needs a loan from the Bank of Evil, that is hillarious
user2: yes, perfect combination of drama and fun! great for adults and kids!
user2: and I love his old Mama character!
user1: Rotten Tomatoes score is pretty good too
user2: yes, it is, I would personally rate it even higher
user2: and the second movie was great too! both were successful!
user1: Yeah the part of the three girls is heart warming, but the fact that he took them to the carnival to "abandon" them is hillarious.
user1: Dr. Nefario dislike the girl but Gru just keeps getting closer to them.
user2: Yes, I love it when he sings them a lullaby! 
user1: I think a Gru adopting them for nefarious plans was a great plot as well
user2: yes! and the minions being his maid and taking care of the home, adorable!
user1: Gru eventually steals the shrink ray from Vector, so using the girls was helpful but probably the wrong message. Haha, yeah, the Minions warmed right up to the kids too.
user2: I wonder if they will make any more of these movies because they are very funny and innocent-unlike all the other junk out there!
user1: Gru does manage to steal the moon but Dr. Nefario realizes the shrinking is only temporary.
user1: Cinema Score of A, probably will make more
user2: He is like an evil type of Einstein!
user1: I didn't know Russel Brand was Dr. Nefario
user2: Really?!
user1: Yeah
user2: Wow, he is pretty talented!
user1: He has a great voice for sure
user2: yes, definitely!
user2: I hope they make more of these!
user1: I am sure they will :)
user1: I think we said everything we could
user2: yes, thanks for the chat, have a good one!
user1: have a great day!
user1: yw
user2: thanks, bye!

user1: It is animation but instead of featuring a superhero, it is from the prospective of a supervillian.  It's geared to kids but also amusing for adults
user2: sounds like a great family movie, what is it called?
user1: It's called Despicable Me
user2: Oh nice, is this movies a part of a series or is it stand alone?
user1: I'm not sure.  It was released in 2010 so there may have been others released afterwards but I do not know
user2: ok cool, what do you like most about the movie?
user1: It's so funny!!!
user2: awesome, is it a short movie or a long movie?
user1: I do not know specifically how long it is but is a feature film--so long
user2: Ok great. What company made the film?
user1: It was animated by a French animation studio, Mac Guff, which was acquired by Illumniation Entertainment.  It was their debut film.  It was co-released in the US by Universal Pictures and Illumniation Entertainment. 
user2: That's interesting. Who is in this movie?
user1: Steve Carell plays Gru, the supervillain, Jason Segal plays his archenemy and Russel Brand plays Gru's elderly gadget man/friendly scientist 
user2: Oh I like Steve Carell, he is funny!!
user1: Yes!  As the supervillain he tries to shrink and steal the moon!
user1: He goes to the bank to get a loan to finance his plan but the banker tells Gru that he will only do so if he finds a shrink ray first
user2: Ahhhh ok, that is so funny
user1: His archenemy, Vector, the character that Jason Segal plays, has the shrink ray at his house.  So Gru goes to his fortress to steal it 
user2: Oh ok, is there a hero in the movie?
user1: Well it ends up being Gru.  He's the type of supervillian you route for.  See he's also in charge of three little girls and you see how much heart he has toward them
user1: After stealing the shrink ray he succesfully shrinks and steals the moon but has to rush back to earth to attend their ballet recital
user1: What else would you like to know about the movie?  
user2: Is there any time traveling going on in the movie?
user2: Or any kind of time element?
user1: No there is no time travel but there is a little history.  See Gru is interested in stealing the moon because Vector stole the Great Pyramid of Giza.  
user1: The movie takes place in modern day--they have videochat ;)
user2: oh that's cool, very modern. Does the movie take place in a day or over a several month period?
user2: Basically, what is the time line structure?
user1: It takes place over several days

conversation:
user2: Hey, what's the name of the movie you just read about?
user1: Despicable Me. What about you?
user2: I didn't read anything about a movie...
user2: What's your movie about?
user1: Oh okay. So it's an animated film about this villain who ends up adopting three girls. I mean it's not the greatest movie I would say. 
user1: The animation wasn't done very well and truly the plot could've been better
user2: A villain who adopts three girls? How would he adopt him if he was a bad guy? haha
user2: Oh no, okay. Was it at all funny? 
user1: Well they were orphans so they just kind of end up with him. 
user1: I mean it was like cheesy funny. 
user2: Did he try to hurt them or did he end up being nice to them haha
user2: Is this the movie with the little minion guys? 
user1: At first, he wasn't a huge fan of them but then it worked out. 
user1: YESS! That's the one. 
user2: Okay yeah I was interested in seeing if for sure. I liked Hotel Transylvania...maybe I'm getting the two mixed up
user1: Oh i'm not sure if i've ever heard of that one. 
user2: It's about this vampire guy who has a daughter and for her 18th birthday he invites the entire family to his hotel for her party
user2: but the family is like ghosts and zombies and weird things like that
user2: I actually love it
user1: Ohh that sounds fun. Was it ever in theaters? Or was it a direct to tv movie?
user2: I'm not sure. I always watched it on Netflix or something like that. 
user2: Do you think Dispicable Me is worth giving a chance? 
user1: Oh okay, maybe i'll look into it. 
user1: I think Despicable Me is also on netflix.
user2: Maybe I'll check that out
user2: Not sure what else to ask about it haha
user1: Yes, definitely go for it. I mean it's got a bunch of different characters who have the most hilarious backstories. 
user1: Like they don't even make sense sometimes. 
user2: Sounds like a typical Pixar movie
user2: Perhaps I shall!
user1: Yeahh, he's trying to steal the moon I think. 
user1: Or build a shrink ray or something
user1: Welp. Looks like our conversation can end now. This was fun! 

conversation:
user1: HI, there!  I'm looking for a movie to see -- or one to avoid! -- do you have any thougths?
user2: Have you seen Despicable Me? 
user1: I haven't! Who's in it? Who directed it?
user2: Pierre Colffin and Chris Renaud are the directors.  Steve, Carrell, Jason Segel and Russel Brand
user1: Hmmmm.  Steve Carrell and Russell Brand are interesting. What's it about?
user2: It's a computer-animated comedy. Has a super villain archenemy, and a scientist
user1: Hmmmm....I don't generally like those. Anything especially interesting in the general plot line?
user2: Not that I am aware of. It's a debut film from Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment. Probably just a good cartoon is what it looks like.
user1: Well, it could be interesting. What were the reviews like?
user2: The reviews were good, laughs and funny, kids and adults.  So looks like it is good for all ages.
user1: Any other info on the plot?
user2: A supervillian is sad when another supervillian steals the Great Pyramid of Giza (he had been thinking of doing that).  The supervillian then decides to steal the moon. Then a rivalry starts between the two
user1: That sounds fun! I love the idea of stealing the Great Pyramid. I wonder where you stash that thing! The moon, too.  I love the moon. Anything else?
user2: Looks like Gru, the main character refers to himself by Gru,  I always think that's funny when they do that. 
user1: I often refer to myself as Gru. I can identify. What is the supervillan's name?
user2: Gru is the supervillan and Vector is his archenemy
user1: Ah!  Gru is the bad guy, then. Vector, the scientist of course, is the good guy. What does he aim to do to recover the pyramids and prevent the theft of the moon?
user2: Gru steals a shrink ray to get money for a loan. Looks like some little kids are involved and Gru starts to have feelings for them.  They are from an orphanage.  Then we have the battle of good vs. evil internally- watch the kids at a recital or steal the moon.
user1: Oh, yes, well, that's always a good angle. Still, doesn't often get the chance to steal the moon, so those kids must have been a real draw! I take it he goes to the orphanage? Is Vector watching all this?
user2: No but he is told about everything going on so he knows Gru's feelings.
user1: And do they end up getting together in the end and teaming up?
user2: I'm not sure. 
user1: Any other details that might make me want to watch the movie?
user2: There is a daring mid air rescue on the girls. Could be some suspense.
user1: Sounds like it. Which girls are these?
user2: The little kids from the orphanage
user1: Oh, I didn't realize they were all girls. Who was rescuing them? Had Gru kidnapped them?
user2: No. Gru was the one who had the girls and Vector kidnapped them.  Sorry so confusing. 
user1: Oh, it is confusing! I thought Vector was the good guy, but he kidnapped the girls? Did Gru take them from the orphanage originally?
user2: I think Gru is the bad guy turned good- he wanted to get the girls from the orphange.  Then Vector is the bad villain. 
user1: I see! Any word about the ending?
user2: I believe the bad villian- Vector is launched into outer space. 

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: hello
user2: how do you feel about despicable me?
user2: i like all 3 of the actors, jason segel, russel brand, and steve carell
user1: I agree with the CinemaScore, giving it an A. It's a movie I would watch again but I tend to like 3d Animated Movies, they seem to be funny and have that comedic touch I'm looking for. Who did Steve Carell play again?
user2: steve carell played a mean supervillain 
user2: there is a song by pharrell in the movie, i enjoy pharrell
user1: Oh yeah, his name was Gru. I thought his enemy was the funniest part of the movie. My kids liked him too. 
user1: It's a good song, there always needs to be a good theme song. It makes the memory more memorable
user1: Would you agree with the "sweet-and-sour" review?
user2: yes, i do. i think thats a great explanation of the good/evil in the movie 
user1: I think so too, villians that end up a little good in the end
user2: yes it shows that they have a heart as well
user2: is there supposed to be a second paragraph? i don't see it
user1: Key Scenes
user1: Gru seems to really get amped up when someone else steals a Great Pyramid, he tries to come up with a scheme to steal the Moon
user2: i think thats funny how he sought a loan from "the bank of evil" as someone would in real life
user1: The bank even puts a contingency like most banks in real life do, that he has to come in possession of the shrink ray first, it was a silly touch
user2: do you think gru ended up obtaining the shrink ray for his loan?
user2: i think this movie sounds adorable. he wants to steal the moon when its closest to earth but doesnt want to miss the girls ballet recital
user1: Of course, but he has to enlist the help of three little girls because he can't get in to Vector's place on his house. It's a bit of a genius plan if you ask me
user1: It is, he's conflicted between this unconditional love and his lifelong dreams to get the Moon
user1: Dr. Nefario sounds like the true evil villian in it all, with returning the girls to the orphanage
user2: i agree. 
user1: I hope he gets them back
user2: yeah, hopefully vector doesn't get too in the middle of anything
user1: I forgot about Vector kidnapping the girls

conversation:
user1: Hi!  Have you seen Steve Carell's movie Despicable Me?
user2: No I have not, What is it?
user1: It's an animated film about a supervillian... it got very high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Who is the supervillian?
user1: Steve Carell plays the supervillian called Gru.  It also stars the voices of Jason Segel and Russell Brand
user2: I like movies with russell brand, Who does he voice?
user1: He voices Dr. Nefario who is a friendly sort of scientist gadget guy
user2: Wow! so what does Gru and this scientist do? whjat is the plot?
user1: I only know that those people were in it and that it was animated by a French animation studio... I was hoping you had more info, HA!  I do know that critics say that kids and adults both will enjoy it!
user2: Well that is awesome!  Im gonna guess that since Gru is the main character that  he refers himself as Despicable Me, the title. Since he is a villain.
user2: Do you know why Gru ks a villain, what does he do that makes him abad guy?
user1: Well, I do know that the supervilliain is apparently trying to 'one-up' another supervilliain by shrinking and stealing the Moon... 
user2: Another supervillian wants the moon? how awful...lol..who is this other character?
user1: Um, no, I think the other character has pulled off another similar action... shrinking and stealing the Great Pyramid at Giza.
user2: well dang, maybe the second bad dude is the top villain. So how does Gru pull off stealing the moon all by himself?
user1: It is somehow about Gru attempting to get the financing for his big scheme and how he makes a rival out of the other guy which turns out to be Vector, the character voiced by Jason Segal
user1: He ends up having to steal a shrink ray in order to get the money
user2: ok so vector is the other bad guy. why doesnt Gru just go to a bank and get a loan?
user2: Or ask some friends for the money?
user1: He tried to I guess, but the condition was that he steal the ray to get the moneyh... 
user1: Also there are some little girls that he becomes attached to and it complcates his feelings over it
user2: ok. SO I was just going to ask if he had any family that could help him. what are the girls names and how many?
user1: I'm not sure the girls names or such... but he does get quite attached, especially when they do things like offer their piggy banks to help him with money... 
user1: Wait.. their name might be Margo, Edith and Agnes
user2: Pretty names. And sweet girls to offer up their own money for him, they must love one another.
user2: So does Gru get the moon or does the other guy?
user1: I know he really warms up to them over the course of the film.  He does successfully shrink and steal the Moon.  But it gets very complicated because the girls get kidnapped. He has to surrender it to Vector...
user1: The plot thickens when Dr Nefario figures out that the shrink ray effect is only temporary.
user2: So Gru gives the moon to Vector to save the girls, thats deep. Does Vector give the girls back?
user1: He reneges on the deal... but then the 'good' guys do a rescue attempt as the Moon expands back to it's original size.
user2: Conversation can be done, it was nice chatting with you about Despicable me. Have a great day!
user1: You too!

conversation:

user2: OK take your time
user1: He shrinks and steals the moon! Sounds like a villian!
user2: hahahahaha steals the moon !!! ?? amazing
user1: Then they learn that the shrink ray that shrunk the moon is only temporary! Since the moon is so big, it won't last long
user2: wow? and grows on the earth?
user1: No it launches back into orbit. Doesn't that sound cool?
user2: Amazing, incredible, it's drawing my attention
user1: I see the super villian Gru also steals a pyramid!
user2: then it is not any villain, it seems to be something ambitious
user1: Yes, that's right!
user1: He had to get a loan from an evil bank to do it
user2: jjajajaja a villain but does paperwork, it's funny
user1: I know right!
user1: The bank is called Bank of Evil
user2: hahahaha sounds something evil
user1: Gru also steals the shrink ray
user2: Gru steals everything ... continues ...
user1: What do you think of Gru?
user2: for now he is a very curious villain
user1: I see Gru also was paying the minions, but couldn't afford it anymore
user2: and what happened?? hahah I love the minions
user1: Some girls then offered their piggy bank!
user2: how beautiful the girls
user1: I don't know. it's a cartoon

user2: you are convincing me to watch the movie
user1: Looks like Gru also has a rivalry with another villian, Vector
user2: rivalry between villains !? it sounds dangerous
user1: Not only does these villians seem dangerous, but also broke jajajaja
user2: hahahahaha, what a great

user2: seems to have a bit of this movie ... I'm very interested in seeing her ........ my friend, it was a pleasure this talk, although we started a little bad because I do not load the document well but in the end we managed to make the goal , thank you very much
user1: Yes, I'm glad we made the goal and it was a pleasure as well! take Care

conversation:
user1: Hello there!
user2: Hi, I have the documents.
user1: So do I. We share them this time.
user2: It's an animation from 2010.
user1: Yep. Despicable Me.
user2: Yes, it is.
user1: Have you seen it?
user2: Weird, because only one of us is supposed to receive it.
user2: Yes, I have seen the movie.
user1: No, I think there's a version where we both receive it. It's just much less common.
user2: Hey, Jason Segal plays in the movie.
user1: Yeah he was pretty good as Vector. But I think Steve Carell really steals the show.
user2: Yeah, Steve Carell is amazing.
user2: Not so much lately, though.
user1: Do you usually like animated movies?
user2: Yes, I do, but I love the older ones more.
user2: How about you?
user2: I think that the animations from the early 2000s are way better and funnier.
user1: Generally yeah, I really like ones that aren't just for kids.
user2: Yes, I know what you mean.
user1: Despicable Me was pretty good though. It was nice seeing Gru's character arc.
user2: Yes, it's good and also for any age range.
user2: It has gotten a good rating at Rotten Tomatoes at 81%
user1: Vector was definitely for the kids though.
user2: Definitely. 
user1: I honestly thought it would be rated a bit higher if I'm being honest.
user1: The finale with the moon was very exciting though.
user2: Not with those guys at Rotten Tomatoes, they are strict and unfunny.
user2: The critics over there are too robotic and unemotional. 
user2: Hey, nice chatting with you. You're cool.
user1: Thank you. Haha. It's a bit of a change when we both have the document.
user1: What was your favorite scene?
user2: I love the spacecraft scene, all of it.
user2: Ok, I think we did it. Nice chatting. Have a nice day.
user1: Well it looks like we're done.
user1: You too

conversation:

user2: How about, it seems like a good movie.

user2: yes, the characters seem to be very funny, and the theme of the children is pretty good
user1: yes this was the first movie of Illumination Entertainment.
user2: imagine, make bad old man, with old ways, in a world of modern bad guys
user1: yes it cant help bu tbe likable
user2: I'm sorry, I thought it was a pixar movie, but it's from Illumination Entertainment
user1: oh yes bru starts out buy stealing the pyramid. i forgot about that part
user1: remember when gru went to get the loan form the bank of Evil
user2: has a song by Pharrell. there are several, songs, of this kind very good. Yes, the guy was good but with technology, or you update or lose.
user2: that bank persona was really ugly.
user1: then gru had to get the shring ray from vector a new villian that was spoiled
user2: Vector is nice, but very silly, looks like a child with toys
user1: jason segel played victor
user1: the theam park sceen was great . love the fluffy unicorn

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello there
user1: How are you
user2: I'm doing fine, how about you?
user1: I'm good. Have you seen despicable me?
user2: I have, I think it's a pretty fun movie.
user1: Yeah same here. I've seen all three of the movies. The second one is my favorite
user2: I think my favorite would still be the first. I really liked the set up to the series.
user1: Yeah. The first one will always be a classic. I think what I like most about the movie is when he gets attached to the girls and I also like the minions.
user2: Me too, I liked those kind of character arcs. I love the minions too, there were definitely a highlight.
user1: I know it's wonderful. One of my younger cousins loves the minions. Whenever he would cry I would put despicable me on and he would stop crying in an instant. The best thing about this movie is how family oriented it is.
user2: That's very true. When I have a family get together myself, usually that is a pretty safe bet that everyone will it enjoy and have a good time.
user1: Yes, I love family gatherings. We always end up having fun and a good time. I believe movies bring families together too and think despicable me is one of those movies that wlll do that
user2: I agree. Animated movies like this or pixar movies, can give families nice quality time together. Despicable Me also has a pretty good message that everyone can takeaway with.
user1: Yes I agree. I'm a big fan of animated movies and grew up on Disney and Pixar movies. I always thought that the ones I grew up watching would always be the best and they are but even the new ones be pretty good too.
user2: Me too. I think as long as film makers make animated movies for the right reasons with their heart in the right place, there will always be classic animated movies that everyone can enjoy of any age.
user1: Yes that's right. I believe it teaches both kids and adults a lot. It's almost like the best of both worlds.
user2: It really is the cream will always rise to the top for future generations.
user1: Yeah. I just hope they'll continue to make good animated film when have kids someday. The only thing I can't get into is the new cartoon shows they have for kids.
user2: Yea I don't get the new shows either, there's just too many that feel slapped together with no meaning.
user1: Really. I just get any of them,but I do like some of the new  adult cartoons but some I don't get either
user2: I do like adult oriented cartoons too. I just think some are made without a lot of care.
user1: Yeah I agree. It wouldn't help for them to do like they do with animated movies. Maybe they could add a few lessons that we can earn too.
user2: That would be good. Make them more accessible for everyone without losing quality of the product.
user1: Yes. I have a feeling it's going to get worse over the years. 
user2: Me too. But you never know. It could be great in the future.
user1: Yeah that's true. I just hope the make at least one more despicable me movie
user2: That would be pretty awesome.
user1: Yeah. Well it was nice chatting with you. I hope you have a wonderful day.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Despicable Me - it has a rating of over 81% on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: Hi, what did you think about Gru? 
user2: I think the rating should have been higher.
user1: I've actually never watched this film, but have always wanted to
user1: What are your thoughts about Gru?
user1: The archetypal villain?
user2: You should definitely watch it. It is funny and touching at parts.
user1: Definitely sounds like a very unique film
user2: I think Gru is awesome. He makes a great main character.
user1: I notice it has great reviews from the critics as well
user2: Yes, it does. Again, I believe the ratings don't quite show how great this movie is.
user1: Steve Carrell plays Gru, I notice. Sounds like a strong performance. 
user2: I love how the movie shows a rivalry that isn't between hero and villain, but villain and villain. 
user1: Yeah, I agree. I've also quite often found that ratings (at times) are not reflective at all of how good / bad a movie is.
user1: Yeah, that's definitely a new twist.                  
user2: I personally think that Mr. Coffin and Mr. Renaud did a great job directing, 
user1: Sounds like movie has great humor, action and heart!
user1: From what I read of the plot, it also sounds like there are quite a few twists and turns...
user2: It truly does. I also find it interesting that Mr. Perkins (the bank president) is Gru's rival's father. 
user1: Yeah, that's interesting and I think his minions sound cute too. As well as the three orphan girls. 
user2: Mr. Perkins CONVENIENTLY decides that Gru isn't the man for the job of stealing the moon.  
user2: They do sound cute. I love how Gru starts to warm up to them at the theme park.
user1: The whole plot is just so imaginative to begin with! Stealing the moon, how creative is that?
user1: All-in-all, just a very captivating film with an engaging narrative and imaginative characters...
user2: I know! 
user2: I think that Vector is just a horrible person.
user2: I love that he was left stranded on the moon. 
user1: Despicable in name only! (the movie title I'm referring to here)
user1: Ahh, yes I agree. I haven't watched yet, just familiar with the plot details, some characters etc. 
user1: But that sounds like a fitting ending
user2: The whole movie is just amazing. You really need to see it. 
user1: I will for sure. Adding it to my watch list!
user1: From what I've seen in the trailers, the animation looks gorgeous, bright and nicely rendered with a deft touch of simplicity to it, causing it to be not too overly glossy and polished
user2: The characters are lovely, the plot actually has some depth to it (enough for adults to like, but not enough to be complicated for kids), and the feel of the movie is perfect.
user1: I also love that it's in 3D
user1: I think that's a great ability of Pixar films, to be able to make films for adults and kids alike. 
user1: Well, thank you for chatting. It's been nice talking to you!
user2: I know. It is hard to believe it was released in 2010. Every time I see it, it feels like the first time. You'll see once you watch it.

conversation:
user1: hello
user1: have you seen Despicable Me?
user2: hi
user2: Yes, I have seen it a while ago. You?
user1: Yes, a few years ago.
user2: What did you think?
user1: What were your favorite parts or character?
user2: Honestly, while the minions were amusing at times, I was more entertained by the kids. I liked the littlest one the most.  I also liked Gru. He was funny and I enjoyed watching him slowly bond with the kids.
user2: How about you?
user1: my favorite was Gru, maybe because it was Steve Carelll
user1: I like how he changes from being so rude an arrogant and then heartwarming towards the orphans
user1: The good part about this movie is that it is suitable for all age groups
user1: what do you think?
user2: Yeah, Steve Carell is great. It was enjoyable to see his personality change from the beginning to the end, in a good way! I agree that it is suitable for all ages, which is also a plus. Everyone can enjoy it for different reasons, but it's a movie that all ages can watch, so there was no need to cover ears or eyes at anytime like some movies...
user1: Did they have a sequel to this movie?
user1: I didn't get to see that one
user2: I believe so. There may have actually been two out since this one. I'm not entirely sure.
user2: I'm surprised that the ratings are so varied: A, 81%, 72%, and a 6.8/10... I am surprised some were lower than 80 as it was a decent movie.
user2: It says there was a song by Pharell. Do you know what song it was?
user1: Sometimes you can't really trust the ratings. I don't always go totally by it
user1: was it Happy?
user2: That's true!
user2: I feel like it didn't start out happy, but the more he bonded with the kids, the happier the movie got.
user2: What do you think?
user2: Interestingly, after reading the key scenes, I don't remember a lot of what happened in the movie. I need to watch it again.
user2: I do like that Gru was conflicted about stealing the moon vs. watching the girls' dance recital.
user1: I agree with you. The movie changes in the end. But I have to refresh my memory too,,,,,has been a while
user1: Maybe we can watch it again on DVD
user2: I'm sure netflix or amazon may have it too. definitely one to put on my list of things to watch at some point :)
user2: I'm surprised it came out 8 years ago. It doesn't feel that long.
user1: I feel the same, it seems like two to three years ago.
user1: I guess it's because we see the merchandise around in stores
user1: it is still so popular
user2: I agree. Probably right! There is definitely still merchandise out there, but I guess I forgot that there was more than one movie.
user2: Do you know who Jason Segel is? His name is familiar, but I don't know why?
user2: Scene 3 was enjoyable to watch because he is now invested in these girls and the old Gru probably wouldn't care that Vector took the girls, but the new Gru cares about them and creates a plan to save them!
user2: Anything else you liked or disliked about the movie?
user1: I frankly don't remember too many details. But overall it was a fun movie
user1: Since I like Steve Carell, I enjoyed watching Gru
user2: Yeah, I agree. I don't remember much, but I remember liking it.
user2: I guess I didn't like it enough though since I didn't see any other ones...
user2: Anything else we need to mention? I'm not sure what else we should talk about?

conversation:
user2: Hi have you seen this movie?
user1: Hi, No i havent seen this movie 
user1: you?
user2: Do you watch many animated movies?
user2: No me either,
user1: Not really
user1: Did you know the director of this movie?
user2: Are you surprised by the ratings the movie got? No don't know the director.
user1: honestly yes a bit surprised, they seems to high for me
user2: Interesting I thought maybe they were a bit low I know people with kids that raved about this movie.
user1: I only have heard bad things about this movie due to the "Minions"
user1: people seem to not like them 
user2: Really? 
user2: I don't personally care for the evilness in this movie I wouldn;t want my kids watching it.
user1: Honestly i believe the same, i woulnd't want too 
user1: there are better movies for sure
user2: Yeah it has stealing and evil bankers and supervillains. Not good for kids in my opinion. Definitely better movies out there.
user1: Did you read the key scene number 2? there you can see how ambicious is Gru and his minions
user1: starting a rilvalry without any real causes, just their egos and their plans
user2: what do you think about the 3 girls roles? Yes actually I was just reading that.
user1: its not like that a person like Gru can adopt girls even if he "save" them from the orphanage its not like he is a good example for the girls
user1: right?
user2: Exactly. It's sad that they are in the middle of it and being part of everything going on.
user1: definetly not a good movie to watch for kids, thats why i said that the rating was to high
user2: It doesn't mention much about the minions. Wonder what their role in this movie is?
user2: I agree!
user1: They act like soldiers
user1: they just obey everything for the right prize
user2: Kidnappings and stealing the moon and such. Yes agree with you!
user1: What do you think about Vector being trapped into the orbit?
user1: do you find it fair? was he really a bad human being?
user1: human beging*?
user2: From what it says I suppose he was. Fair I don't believe so but I guess this movie is all about judging.
user1: I agree with you! its all about judging sadly 
user2: I wonder of the girls change Gru or if he causes them to be like him.
user2: if
user2: I find this movie to just be sad. It  may have amusing parts to it but over all it's a sad movie!
user1: I think that he would cause them to be like him.. maybe they can change Gru but unfortunately we dont have enough information in the text
user1: I totally agree, pretty sad overall and with plenty of flaws and bad vibes
user2: True I would hope that good would overcome evil in this movie but it's doubtful.
user2: Yes bad vibes, totally agree!
user1: Thats why this movie becomes famous, because it isnt a regular movie for kids like the others
user1: probably this movie have a bad ending with evil winning
user2: True. It teaches everything a child should not be taught.
user2: Probably! 
user1: Also did you like the Dr Nefrio character? did he seems interesting to you?
user1: Nefario*
user2: From the info the only good in this movie were the girls and Dr. Nefario the friendly scientist and it doesn't seem like he was talked about much.
user1: Totally true
user2: It would have been nice to seen more from him I think.
user1: Yeah agree
user1: do you have more question regarding the movie?
user2: No not really
user1: Me neither
user2: ok thanks for the chat
user1: was a nice talk! goodbye and have a nice day
