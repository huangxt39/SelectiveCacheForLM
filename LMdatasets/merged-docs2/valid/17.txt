critical response:
the best animated musical to come out of Disney since the tragic death of lyricist Howard Ashman, whose work on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast helped build the studio's modern animated division into what it is today.
while it lags the tiniest bit on its way to the conclusion, the script... really delivers; it offers characters to care about, along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way.
You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become while watching Disney's 3D animated princess tale.
a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core, brilliant Broadway-style songs and a crafty plot. Its first and third acts are better than the jokey middle, but this is the rare example of a Walt Disney Animation Studios effort that reaches as deep as a Pixar film.
Frozen is both a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation of Disney coming to terms with its own legacy and its own identity. It's also a just plain terrific bit of family entertainment.

description:
Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses cryokinetic magic, often using it to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, rush both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa s magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna, causing a rift between them. Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm. 
When Elsa turns twenty-one, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear for her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Amongst them is the scheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls head-over-heels in love. Elsa s coronation happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the kingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching the North Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of ice in which to live a solitary life. 
Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes agitated, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. She then summons a giant snow creature named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless 'an act of true love' reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow, and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. He locks Anna in a room to die, and manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.

user2: Hi!
user2: What is the movie about?
user1: Just a moment. I have to read the document.
user2: Okay :D
user1: The movie is a musical, has a 89% Rotten Tomatoes rating, and stars Idina Menzel. She was made famous for the musical Wicked.
user1: Do you like musicals?
user2: I think it depends on the topic
user2: What is the topic of this one?
user1: It's a fairy tale, based on Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen." The main characters have to find a way to release the world from the icy grip of winter.
user1: It's animated.
user2: That sounds a little like Frozen
user2: Is it?
user1: It is! You've heard of it, then? It sounds to me like it's worth seeing.
user2: I have indeed
user2: You haven't seen it?
user1: I have. I loved it.
user2: Same
user2: What was your favorite part?
user1: Hmmm... I'm supposed to be convincing you to see it. I can't talk about anything not on the document.
user1: Let me tell you about it. It's bringing up key scenes.
user2: Oh, okay, I am all ears
user2: :)
user1: In the beginning, we find that Princess Elsa has magical powers. She accidentally hurts her sister with them, though.
user2: Oh no, that is awful
user1: The king and queen take the younger sister to be healed, and the being that heals her also changes her memory so that she doesn't remember her older sister has magical abilities.
user2: This is a good beginning
user1: Elsa eventually becomes queen, but she's terrified that people will find out about her powers and be afraid of her. They have a castle party, and the younger sister--Anna--falls in love with a visiting dignitary, who proposes to her. Elsa says, "No" and loses control of her powers in front of everyone.
user2: Oh no D:
user1: The Duke, the guy Anna fell for, brands her a monster. Elsa runs away, but the kingdom is left in an eternal winter, due to her magic.
user2: I love Winter but this is not good
user2: Poor Elsa
user1: Anna goes to find Elsa and meets some new friends along  the way. When they find and confront Elsa, she accidentally injures Anna again.
user2: This definitely is not good :(
user1: One of her new friends takes her back to the same being who healed her before. He says that an act of true love is the only thing that can save her now. I won't spoil the ending.

user2: I love her voice!
user1: I like that Anna was fearless, and didn't act like your typical Disney princess.
user2: That's right...she's extroverted and fun!
user1: The first part of the movie, explaining how the sisters were orphaned, and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic, but I do like how everything wrapped up in the end.
user1: It's hard to believe this is Disney's 53rd animated feature film!  I'd find it difficult to even name that many Disney animated features!
user2: Yeah, the ending has a very special meaning
user2: Do you have any other favorite film?
user2: from Disney
user1: A few, but I thought for purposes of this exercise, we must confine our conversation to the information in the document?
user2: That's correct
user2: What is your rating for Frozen?
user1: The document is growing, and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added.  I'm reminded of the scene where Elsa builds her ice palace.  It was an impressive bit of computer generated animation.
user1: I would rate Frozen as an 80%, or 8 out of 10. 
user2: Yeah, the animation was outstanding
user2: My favorite scene is when Anna gets hitby Elsa at the very beginning.
user1: The Duke of Weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !
user1: I like all the scenes with musical numbers in them.
user1: What did you like the least about the film?
user2: I did not like that the parents died
user2: did you know that there is a scene where rapunzel appears in Frozen?
user1: The parents dying was sad and unexpected, and a dramatic way to start the film
user1: I did not know that Rapunzel appeared in Frozen. 
user2: Yeah, very briefly
user1: I have to agree it's the best Disney animated film in quite a few years... since the Lion King.

user2: i thought it was sad when the parents died at sea
user1: I like the rock family they were cute.
user1: Do you think it will end up on Broadway?

user2: i argree. i did not like Hans

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hello
user2: Have you seen the movie Frozen?
user1: Yes I have, I actually saw it in theatres with my Fiance at the time it came out.
user2: Did you like it?
user1: Yes, it is a funny animation film.
user2: I agree. I saw it in theaters too
user1: I enjoy almost anything that Disney produces
user2: The critical response was pretty good I see. \
user1: I heard they are making a second movie to follow Frozen
user2: It only got an 89 percent on rotten tomatoes. I thought it would get a higher score.
user1: I don't much care for review sites, I would rather watch a movie and judge it myself.
user2: I agree with the CinemaScore of A+
user1: Me too, I love the artwork and time that goes into animation and C.G. movies
user2: It seems like this movie just came out. I cannot believe it was 2013 when it arrived in theaters. 
user1: Yeah, so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as toys, shows and other items.
user2: Who is your favorite character in Frozen?
user1: It either has to be Sven or Christophe
user1: Kristoff*
user2: Do you know who Kristen Bell is?
user1: I know of her, but not familiar of her other acting jobs.
user2: I like the villain. I thought he was funny.
user1: Yeah, something was up when they fell for each other early in the movie between him and Anna
user1: Olaf could be a bit much sometimes, but had some funny parts
user2: Yeah, I did not even guess he would have been a bad guy
user1: I think I called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys.
user2: Good point. I didn't even think of that
user1: He looks like the villian commander from the newer Star Wars movies.
user2: What rating would you give the movie out of ten?
user1: I think an 9, it was a great movie, even if the music is overplayed
user2: Bye!

conversation:
user2: Hello there!
user1: hey
user2: So tell me a little bit about this movie :)
user1: have you seen the movie frozen?
user2: I actually have not...but I've heard let it go too many times for comfort.
user2: How do you feel about the movie? Care to share a little bit?
user1: They say its the best animated movie Disney has put out since Beauty and the beast
user1: I think it was a great movie. The songs are adorable. good for kids. even the critics liked it
user2: Hmm I think I'll have to check it out. So I can at least say that I've seen it then ! :)
user1: yes. its a story of two princesses. Elsa and Anna
user2: Who doesn't like princesses? Whats the story line like?
user1: Princess Elsa has magic powers but is insecure about since she injured her sister when they wonder. It became to much and she ran away
user2: Well that's depressing
user1: Their parent died and Ana has to find her sister so they can run the country together. 
user2: So what's the storyline?
user1: Well Elsa runs away after their parents died. Ana goes on this journey to find her sister and help her sister control her magic so they can return home. Its a cute movie for the kids
user2: Sounds interesting. Maybe I'll kidnap one of my nieces or nephews and.watch it with them. Thanks! 
user1: They will love it. Theres even a love story within the plot as well. Everyone loves a prince and princess love story
user2: Haha I guess that's true. I do prefer realism but I do appreciate that Disney throws in adult concepts in children's stories that go right over children's heads
user1: haha yeah they always do that dont they
user2: Rented it online. It's a party!
user1: lol almost makes me want to watch it again
user2: So, now I guess we just hang out until they let us proceed! Let it good!
user2: Let it go* ... Lame.
user1: haha. As much as ive heard the movie songs I still enjoy it from time to time
user2: I just remember my niece's birthday. Must've heard that song 200 times...in a row
user1: Me too. I like the charatcter Olaf. I see him everywhere. Hes a talking snowman. he becomes one of their friends. very cute
user2: There can only be one neighborhood snowman, and that's Frosty! :O
user1: lol Frosty is a classic. But olaf is really small so Frosty stil has that title

conversation:
user2: What do you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
user1: I do too
user1: I was very impressed with both of them, what about Frozen?
user1: I thought they actually did a very good job bringing the story to life in a different way
user2: Yeah I couldn't agree more with you. 
user1: Did you have any favorite parts? Characters?
user2: Disney does a impressive job with animated movies. 
user1: They really do. Its amazing how much detail they put into them.
user2: Jonathan Gross as Kristoff was my favorite character. 
user2: how about yours?
user1: Even though he didn't have a voice I liked Sven. I love how Disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along
user2: Yeah its impressive how they can give a character lots of personality without even having a voice.
user1: I can only wish I was that talented as an artist. I am more the stick figure type of artist
user2: Thats about as much talent as I have when it comes to art as well haha. 
user1: My kids laugh at me all the time about it
user2: From what I'm reading they created a Frozen Broadway show. That would be great to take your kids to!
user1: Hello, are you there?
user2: yes
user2: is this the same person ive been talking to?
user1: Are you still around?
user2: yep still here
user2: did you get the new document
user1: I would be curious to see if htey come out with another frozen
user2: usually sequels can be disappointing but that doesn't seem to be the case with animated movies. 
user1: I think it could be really successful, especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out
user1: It is interesting that Disney was able to add onto the history of works such as Beauty and the beast

conversation:
user2: Hi! How are you? Seen any good movies lately?
user1: yeah, Frozen
user2: Sounds like a cold movie! Can you tell me what it's about? 
user1: Its about two girls Anna and Elsa
user1: Anna is a princess
user1: and Elsa is her younger sister
user2: Gotcha! Is it a movie for children or adults or both?
user1: Difficult to say, probably for both
user2: Well I like kids movies just as much as adult ones sometimes! Did you really enjoy watching it? 
user1: well, its been acclaimed as the best musical made by Disney
user2: I'm trying to find a good movie to watch tonight. 
user2: Sounds like a hit then! Disney movies are always excellent. 
user1: yeah, its also 3D animated, the visual are really good
user1: even rotten tomatoes gave it 89%
user2: Not a bad review for Rotten Tomatoes! I
user2: Is it fairly new or a few years old?
user1: well, it came out in 2013
user2: So fairly new. At least compared to some of the other Disney princess movies!
user2: Can you tell me what the basic plot is?
user2: Don't give too much away though! I don't want to know the ending!
user1: ahaahah, ok
user1: the plot is really good, magic things, talking animals, its exactly what we want from Disney
user2: Perfect! 
user2: I think I have found my movie for tonight! 
user2: Thanks so much for your recommendation!
user1: Sure, no problem! Its also very emotional, so you may need some tissues :)
user2: All the best ones are tear jerkers! I'll be sure to have them handy along with some good snacks.
user1: yeah, the ending is definitely not what you would expect it to be 
user2: Is it a happy ending at least?
user1: well, you have to see it yourself
user1: not to spoil it
user1: the only hint I will give you is that it gets "political" at the end 
user2: True! I hope it's a happy ending! Is this a Disney movie that has a sequel?
user1: actually, I don't know
user2: Well since it's so new they may have not made one yet. But since it had such great reviews I'm sure they will! I
user2: I'll tell you if I enjoyed watching it but I'm sure I will! 

conversation:
user1: Hi there. What did you think of the movie?
user1: Hello?
user2: Hi, I think it's great, it would be good as a Broadway musical
user1: Why do you think it would be great as a Broadway musical?
user2: mainly the singing but also since the story is about a journey.
user2: What do you think?
user1: The music in movie is very catchy and enjoyable, so I agree.
user1: Whose journey did you find most compelling?
user2: Anna's journey
user1: Did you think the conclusion was satisfying for her character?
user2: She was trying to be herself and at the same time protect her sister so I think it was satisfying since that was accomplished.
user1: I agree
user1: Have you heard of the fairy tale that the movie was based on?
user2: No, never.
user2: Which character do you most admire?
user2: hello?

conversation:
user1: hi, what was the movie's name?
user2: The movie is Frozen.  If you haven't seen it you should.
user1: haven't even heard of it, what genre is it?
user2: Frozen is a comedy, adventure, animation.
user1: wow, sounds good. is it on dvd yet?
user2: Cinema Score gives it an A+.  Not sure if it's on DVD
user1: wow, i should go see it at the theater. is it in imax type theaters? 
user2: I don't think it's in theaters still it came out in 2013
user1: ah, so it probably is on dvd. it's not a kids movie?
user2: Yes it's  a kids movie produced by Walt Disney.
user1: i'm not sure i'd like it. is it on youtube?
user2: i have no idea
user1: does it have cowboys and indians in it?
user2: No.  It has Princess Elsa who has cryokinetic powers that she uses to play with her little sister Anna
user1: that sounds good. so "cryokinetic" that sound futuristic, is it set in the future
user2: No, i believe that has to do with ice
user2: Elsa is voiced by Idina Menzel and Anna is voiced by Kristen Bell
user1: what does it do?
user2: Freezes whatever she touches
user1: ah i like Kristen Bell, who else does voices in it
user2: Kristen Bell is great!  Besides Kristen and Idina, there is Jonathan Groff who voices Kristoff
user1: " Kristoff"? what character does he play?
user2: Krisoff is an iceman who is accompanied by a reindeer named Sven
user1: lots of ice in this movie, does it ever show summer time?
user2: Hence the movie Frozen.  I am not sure what seasons are in the movie
user1: heh. running out of things to ask here, who did the soundtrack?
user2: there is a lot of singing in the movie also.   not sure who did the soundtrack
user1: did it feel like the movie took a long time?
user2: while it lags the tiniest bit on its way to the conclusion, the script..really delivers, it offers characters to care about, along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way
user2: Do you think you will give it a try?
user1: nah probably not, i don't like kiss movies, but if it'll help - i'll say yes
user2: Oh okay.  

conversation:
user2: Hello!  
user1: Hey, how's it going?
user2: Ah Frozen, great movie, the kids love it!
user1: Yes, that's what I've heard. Have you seen the movie?
user2: I'm well, enjoying some tea and wishing the outside wasn't FROZEN. LOL
user1: LOL yeah it's frozen here too. There's a lot of information here I didn't know about the movie. I didnt know Kristen Bell was Anna
user2: I've watched frozen more times than I can recall. I think the disc is worn out from the kids. 
user2: Yea I was checking out the actors as well putting voices to in real life faces.
user1: Yeah animated movies always surprise me with what actors and actress voices they use.
user1: Why do you think this was as big a hit as it was?
user1: /is?
user2: I agree, it's fun to look at.
user2: The animation was great as always and the music got all kids not just the girls 
user1: Ah that's true, the music is just so catchy
user2: The made a broadway play based on it, I didnt know that
user1: I did not know that either, but it makes sense. They make musicals out of so many movies nowadays
user1: I thought the plot was pretty good too.
user2: Best animated musical since little mermaid and beauty and the beast this critic says in the article
user1: It showed that it's not good to supress who you are or to supress who other people are and I really agree with that statement
user2: Definitely!
user1: What did you think of the key scenes?
user2: I think my fingers would fall off from saying all my favorites. 
user1: I think in scene 1 they listed in the document, if they didnt suppress Elsa's powers, she easily could have become a superhero
user2: LOL I like the one where Elsa throws snowballs and laughs and laughs!
user2: I need to watch it again tonight, been awhile.
user1: Yeah I can't believe its been about 5 years since it came out.
user2: Yes, she could be considered a super hero, no little girl would disagree!
user1: Yeah for sure!
user2: I hope we get a sequal
user1: I liked the part in scene 3 they listed about when they met the trolls, i thought they were really cute
user2: Frozen 2: Global Warming
user1: LOL that would be a great way to raise awareness as well
user2: LOL have a great day and enjoy the flicks. it wants us to end. :)
user1: You too!

conversation:
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: You should see Frozen since it's one of the best-animated musicals to come out of Disney.  Two sisters fight an eternal winter.
user1: That sounds interesting.Who are the main characters
user1: Nams?
user1: Names?
user2: The main characters are two sisters, Elsa, the Snow Queen of Arendelle and Anna, the Princess of Arendelle.   There is also Kristoff who is an iceman with a reindeer named Sven.
user1: You say its a musical. How did you like the music? 
user2: Frozen has top musical ratings from a variety of critics with stunning broadway quality music.
user1: Sounds like a movie, I would be interested in seeing.
user1: Does the movie have a lot of comedy in it?
user2: It's the 53rd animated Disney animated feature film and has a clever plot and great music.  You would like it.
user2: Yes, it's a comedy-adventure film
user1: Sounds like it would be a great film for the kids
user1: Some movies even kids movies have inappropriate scenes did you see any
user2: There are lots of jokes in it as well, it's definitely a kids movie. Not inappropriate but the sister's parents die at sea during a storm which may be a dark subject 
user1: That could upset some younger children with the parents dying at sea
user1: However, I think for some older kids the subject will not be upsetting 
user2: There are also scenes where Elsa hurts her sister with magic.  But it's part of the lesson told by the movie which is inspired by Han's Christian Anderson's Snow Queen Faity Tale
user1: Now you say lessons. Is the movie overly preachy
user2: It is more entertaining than preachy, focusing on family entertainment.  
user1: Okay, good. 
user1: What parts would you say would stick out among the rest
user2: Sister Elsa does become upset when her sister falls in love with a Duke at Elsa's crowning which causes her to unleash her powers and put Arendale into a permanent winter, freezing everything and making a magnificent ice palace in the process.
user2: Elsa vows to live a solitary life after she's called a monster
user1: Wow, very intriguing. Why do you think Elsa was so upset by her sisters choice to fall in love with Duke?
user2: Elsa objects to a very quick engagement, it causes her to accidentally show her powers to the court and town
user1: Sounds like a very pivotal 
user1: point in the movie
user1: How do you think this affected Anna?
user2: It gets more tense when Elsa accidentally hurts Anna when she comes to find her to tell her what happened to Arrandelle.  She then realizes she has to save Anna
user1: The story is sounding even more interesting. 
user1: Who do you think had the most growth or development in the film?
user2: But there's a twist in that Anna has been deceived by the man she was in love with, he was really plotting to take over the kingdom from the sisters the whole time.  
user1: Great plot twist!
user2: The movie seems to focus the most on Elsa's growth but Anna definitely goes through a lot too
user1: Would you say the movie is positive
user2: The overall movie is, there are dark moments in the plot but the sister's pull through
user2: Everyone will want to watch the ending
user1: I like that the characters are having dark times but they pull through. I am certain I will see this film! Thank you for your suggestion.
user1: Have a positive and great day
user2: It's one of the best animated Disney films.
user1: It certainly sounds like a great Disney film
user2: Hopefully you agree with the good ratings!

conversation:
user2: Frozen! What do you think about it?
user2: I really enjoyed how to was inspired by a
user1: Loved it!  Good Disney movie with a great message!
user2: Amderson's Snow Queen. 
user2: YES! My favorite character is Elsa, #SnowQueen
user1: That is pretty interesting. 
user1: i love how it says you can see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become.  I would go see it!!
user1: My favorite character is Anna, #bestsis
user2: I would too! That's pretty cool. Although I am kinda disappointed that it. has a Metacritics score of 74/100. Obviously it should of gotten a much higher score.
user1: That does seem low - even some of the critical responses were a bit harsh.  I didnt think it lagged at all.
user2: Tbh, I did not know that Kristen Bell was the original voice for Anna. That was really surprising
user2: Do you think there would be a second movie?
user1: I don't know.  Based on the reviews and the success of the first, they should!
user1: word of the day : cryokinetic
user1: I wonder why the troll erased Anna's memories of magic.  Never thought about that before.  Why did Elsa have to hide it from Anna?
user2: I don't know why both Anna and Elsa were kept away from each other, Anna should of known about Elsa's powers 
user1: Right!  She could have helped her sister deal!
user2: And gotten to know her powers better!
user2: A little sister-sister help y'know?
user1: BAD decision from the troll's and the parents
user2: Okay and what about when they opened up the gates??
user2: Hans and Elsa engaged after knowing each other for a few hours? Seems pretty silly to me
user1: Elsa was right to object - Anna is so impulsive.
user2: I think this is where Disney may have gone wrong, I thought we were past this. Anna should of known better
user1: And if they hadn't forced her to supress her magic, none of this would have happened.
user2: Also makes you wonder if Anna ever talked to the staff about being inside or Elsa
user1: I think Anna just latched on to the first person who showed her attention.  She was starving for companionship.
user2: Like they should of said something! Where do they live? Disney logic huh
user1: lol
user2: True I can believe that
user1: Hans is a jerk
user1: This is really dark and twisted on Hans' part.
user2: HE his. He shouldn't of played her like that. If I were him Maybe I would of had more sense
user2: to go about charming Anna
user1: I never knew the snow monster was named Marshmallow

conversation:
user1: Hi have you seen the movie Frozen?
user2: I have not seen the movie Frozen but I have heard good things bout it 
user1: me too, It has a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes, too
user1: would you be interested in seeing it?
user2: Yeah, and I am into a lot of different animated films like that so I would probably like it. From all the postivity that came from it, it must be pretty good 
user2: Yeah I would be interested in seeing it. I will watch anything once 
user1: Right, I agree, worth seeing just for the animation, I am interested also. And Kristen Bell voices 2 of the characters, that is sort of interesting. She is pretty funny too
user2: Oh does she? That's awesome because I love her 
user2: She is so funny in everything she does. I love watching anythign with her 
user1: Sounds like a good movie for you to see then!
user2: Haha yeah. I will have to check it out pretty soon. 
user2: And wow I can't believe it came out in 2013. It's been that long already 
user1: SO this task must not be working because we are supposed to move on to a new topic but i don't know what it is.
user2: Yeah, I don't understand it either. I thought there was supposed to be something too and nothings happening 
user1: I hate to screw things up for you, but I think we might be wasting our time?
user2: Well it says this when you click TASKS. I think we just talk about it for 15 turns and then I'm assuming the finish concersation button will light up?
user2: The other user will read a document about a movie.If you are not told the name of the movie, try to ask the movie name.After you are told the name of the movie, pretend you are interested in watching the movie, and try to gather all the information you need to make a decision whether to watch the movie in the end.You don’t have to tell the other user you decision in the end, but please share your mind at the feedback page.
user1: Funny, mine says 3 turns of conversation about 4 topics
user2: Oh yeah thats super weird then. Yeah mine just said 15 turns. So no idea 
user1: well we can continue chatting about Frozen I guess?
user2: I figure you're almost at 12 and if I need 15 we can just keep going and see if the button lights up. It seems like other people have no issues with these 
user1: Do you know the actor Idina Menzel? New name to me
user2: No I never heard of that one. I noticed that when I Googled Frozen 
user1: I wonder if the character Kristoff is a good guy or a bad guy. My son is called Kristoff, I didn't even know there was one in this movie
user2: Oh wow that's cool. Could be either or I think. Kind of sounds like a name where they could be good or bad 
user1: heh. sounds about right. 
user2: Love that it says Kristen Bell is like a warrior. That makes me like her character a lot
user1: Agreed, So nice to see strong female characters. Such a change from the old Disney plots
user2: Ugh so true. Old Disney ones were terrible. Well Idk but you have like 13 messages and I have liek 16 now so Idk
user1: there is also a character names Marshmallow
user1: I think Marshmallow might be the villain
user2: Really? Such a lovely name though haha
user2: My button came up now. I think maybe it noticed we weren't talking about Frozen a couple times so it didn't count. 
user1: shall we click on finish? have a great day & good luck! 

conversation:

user2: I don't think you're here anymore
user2: do you hate me that much?
user2: it never said you left
user2: but it's okay
user2: I still love you
user2: good bye

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: I think you would really like Frozen. It has an 89% score from Rotten Tomatoes
user1: Really? Is it a comedy?
user2: Yes but also an adventure. It is an animated Disney movie that folllws a snow quesn
user1: I love Disney movies. Especially those that have queens.
user2: She has to find her lost sister who has accidentally used her powers to trap their kingdom in a permanent winter. It’s quite the story
user1: It sounds incredible. I would definitely go see it. 

conversation:
user2: Hello! What movie should we watch?
user1: Hello..  My kids and I favorite is Frozen.
user1: But we are all for Disney movies!  How about you?
user2: Whats Frozen about ? My favorite is probably the Matrix
user1: Frozen is an animated children's movie, but adults love it too!  
user1: Matrix is good too!  I can't remember, is it kid friendly?
user2: Who are the actors in Frozen?
user1: Kristen Bell plays Anna and Idina Menzel is Elsa.  Jonathan Groff is Kristoff. . We have watched it probably hundred times or more since it came out in 2013.  My girls love it.
user1: I would love to take them to see it on ice!  The production is wonderful.
user2: hahah. Oh thats so cool they have an on ice production. Where is that at?
user2: Does that mean theres singing in the movie?
user1: Typically if they are doing an ice production, they might make it at a big center (like the Sprint Center) or something like that.  And yes, LOTS of singing in it.  Just in an animated version.
user2: So is it like a musical?
user1: Again, my kids love all Disney movies though.  So The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast are classics too.  It has lots of singing in it.  But it isn't just pure singing!  
user1: There is a plot and good characters!
user2: I like most of the Disney movies also. Have they seen Moana ?
user2: whats the plot about?
user1: Oooh, Moana is another favorite!
user1: The girl (Elsa) has magical powers that can turn anything into ice.  It shows her having to raise her sister (Anna) after her parents were killed, but she couldn't keep her powers under control and eventually even turned her sister into ice.  Sad and cute all at the same time.
user2: That sounds pretty interesting! i see why your kids like it
user2: Moana is pretty good
user2: I like the soundtrack for it a lot
user2: plus its always fun to sing along
user1: Yes, they love it!  Probably a bit more obsessed than love at times!
user2: How old are they?
user1: Yes, so fun to sing along too.  We pull the songs off of Alexa and we sing to lots of Disney movies everyday.
user1: My younger ones are 7 and 4.  But my older 2 kids love those movies too!
user2: hahaha, yeah i have the soundtrack on spotify downloaded!
user2: have you see the greatest showman? its more recent and not Disney
user1: So many of the songs are so catchy!
user1: My oldest is dying to see that.  She is 13!  I have heard so many great things about that one.
user2: it got a lot of good ratings. I want to go watch it but havent had time
user2: Ill probably go watch it soon and Frozen also
user1: I would love to watch it as well!!  I have had lots of people comment on that one.

conversation:
user2: Have youwatched "Frozen"?
user1: yes, ive seen it many times
user1: you?
user2: Yes, way too many times! It's a great movie
user1: a few years back "Let if go" was on regular rotation on our house.
user1: DId you know it was inspired by "The Snow Queen?"
user2: I didn't know that. Do you agree with critics?
user2: They said it's the best animated musical
user1: It was definitely like a Broadway musical.  I can easily imagine the thaterical show
user1: I dont know if its the "best" but I was singing along with my kids...
user2: It's hard not to sing along. Those songs are very catchy
user2: Do you like the actors (voice cast)?
user1: Its hard to say that Disney was ever not "Cuturally" relevant as suggested in the last critical response,  The company has its hands in everything
user1: Yes, I think they did a nice job.  
user1: Disney doesn't really do much wrong when they work at it
user2: It's the 53rd Disney animated feature movie, i can't believe they made so many movies already
user1: my kids were sining 'Do you want to build a snowman this week
user1: I was thinking - "I wonder how many I have seen"
user1: we have a box of old VHS tapes that are Disney movies that we just cant get rid of - they certainly put out good material
user2: I agree! It's crazy this movie was made in 2013! 5 years ago! 
user1: Rating are an interesting thing - how does one say 74/100, another 89, and another an A+
user1: What would you say is your favorite part of the movie?
user1: I have to say the "Let it Go" scene is mine
user2: I don't always agree with ratings! Some movies are really good and rated badly and some terrible movies are rated 90+
user1: I agree
user2: My favorite part of the movie is probably when the sisters came back and finally had a huge party in their castle \
user2: Ana really wanted to socialize :)
user2: Anna*
user1: well she was locked away for the most part
user2: Olaf is really cute
user1: interesting word "cryokinetic" used in that summary
user1: he makes the movie in some parts - he doesnt understand the seasons
user2: He really loved summer
user1: who doesnt
user1: especially when were are buried in a foot of snow here in illinois
user1: the movie is also timeless - people can watch it years from now and get the same feeling about it
user2: I don't! :) I prefer fall. And I love snow! I'm Russian we usually have lots of snow
user1: I know my 3 year old will someday be singing those songs - and she already calls Olaf  "Snowloff"
user2: That's funny!

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello
user1: Do you know the name of the movie?
user2: The movie is Frozen, have you seen it?
user1: No I don't believe I have seen that one yet. I do like animation movies a lot though.
user1: How about you? Have you seen it?
user2: It is categorized as a Comedy, Adventure, Animation.
user1: Do you know what the plotline is about?
user2: I have with my kids, they loved it, it was very popular when it came out and continued to be popular for a few years.
user2: Story of a fearless princess who sets off on a journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer, and a naive snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kindom in eternal winter.
user1: Oh wow, that sounds like it could be quite interesting... I think I will definitely add it to my list of movies to watch.
user1: Thank you for sharing that. 
user2: No problem.
user2: Want to hear some critical responses for the movie?
user1: Yes please, that would be helpful
user2: "the best animated musical to come out of Disney since the tragic death of lyricist HowardAshman, whose work on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast helped build thestudio's modern animated division into what it is today."
user2: more?
user1: That's a glowing review!
user1: Yes, one or two more reviews would be nice to read, thanks 
user2: "while it lags the tiniest bit on its way to the conclusion, the script... really delivers; it offerscharacters to care about, along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way."
user1: Very good review again
user2: "a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core, brilliant Broadway-stylesongs and a crafty plot. Its first and third acts are better than the jokey middle, but this isthe rare example of a Walt Disney Animation Studios effort that reaches as deep as aPixar film."
user1: Sounds like a really wonderful film. Did you have any favorite characters?
user2: Princess Elsa
user1: Oh okay, the main character. Any others?
user2: Anna was an interesting character
user1: Oh, who was she? Also a main character?
user2: It was Elsa's younger sister
user1: Oh okay. Were there any animal characters apart from the reindeer?
user2: Umm I don't think so or can't recall that there were.
user1: Oh I see. Well, the characters all sound interesting and the movie sounds a lot of fun!
user1: Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts and the reviews 
user2: Yeah it's a good watch for sure and np.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: hi 
user2: so how did you like this movie ?
user1: I don't know these actors
user2: me I know some of them who where in glee
user1: I didn't recognize most of the actors
user1: What was Kristen Bell in?
user1: some show about a detective
user1: where SHE was a detective
user2: it is was in veronica mars
user1: YES
user1: Loved that show
user1: Need to rewatch it
user2: she was the principal actor
user1: so the movie, yeah
user1: she was a principal?
user1: in Veronica Mars?
user1: She's too young
user2: do you know the actor who play elsa ? 
user1: nope
user2: She is a girl who are famous on brodway she did musical
user1: the song is too catchy
user1: it's an interesting story, but things get muddled later in the movie
user2: yes it is something that when you hears it, it stay in your head
user1: it STAYS
user1: it moves in
user1: it pays rent for a week
user2: I feel like this movie is totally like cendrillon
user1: it was weird for me, as a male
user1: the women were almost too attractive, too womanly in a way
user1: I guess it was just good animation
user2: yes it is very special and personnally it wasn't something that really like
user1: I liked Beauty and the Beast better
user1: a lot better
user2: it wasn't make with the typical female that we can see now
user1: true
user2: for me it is a story that we see on every animated movie
user1: what is?
user1: the love story?
user2: a girl have a problem or somehting like that and after that she meet a man who can save her
user1: Cinderella Syndrome is a huge problem
user1: For guys, it's White Knight syndrome
user1: so it goes both ways
user1: men looking for a woman to save, as well
user2: totally and i feel like children should see other things because it not real life
user1: indeed
user2: for me at the end, it 

conversation:
user1: Hi! So have you seen the movie Frozen?
user1: I really enjoy animated comedies. Frozen was alright, seemed like every other Disney movie to me, but it definitely had some catchy songs in it. 
user2: Hello. Yes I have seen it on 3D and it was amazing. Very funny Kristoff performance. 
user2: I haven't read the tale " The Snow Queen" but after seeing the movie I am interested on reading it. 
user1: I have not seen it in 3D, I haven't read "The Snow Queen" either, but I suppose I might have to now! That must be great. Is Kristoff your favorite character? I think Jonathan Groff did really well with the voicing. What do you think of the critics responses? Do you agree with the ratings?
user2: Yes for sure Kristoff was the best one for me. He brought a lot of comedy to the history. Strange to say but in this case I agree with the critics. 
user1: I think there was a decent message in the movie, for once in the history of Disney. They actually tell you that you can't fall in love with the first guy you meet, especially when you know nothing about him. I also loved the sisterly bond that happened and how it's message conveyed how important family is. It was definitely emotional.
user2: Yes I agree with you. Do you agree it was the best animated musical since the death of Howard Ashman?
user1: I don't think it's the best, per say, but it was definitely good. I mean just about every Disney movie has music in it, this one most certainly had a great deal of catchy songs, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast will forever be my favorites.
user1: It's an alright script, but like I said, it's a typical Disney movie, someone falls in love, there's villains, there's magic, there's singing and dancing, problems to overcome. I would probably give it a B+ rating instead of an A+, but that's just me.
user2: Yes it is right. Personally I love Pixar movies and this one seems to have the same approach of one of then, maybe this is why I liked it. What about the end of history did you expected more?
user1: I didn't. I kind of predicted what would happen. Seemed logical. How do you feel about the scene where they are kids playing and Elsa accidentally hits Anna with her "ice power" and injures her? I feel like her parents went about it the wrong way, making her fear her powers.
user2: Yes for sure. They pressured her to avoid using the power instead of learning how to control then. That was the main cause of all the future problems. What about the trolls village, did you like then?
user1: Even the trolls tell her she must learn to control her powers, but instead she just suppresses what makes her unique. Pretty sad in my opinion. The trolls are great! They definitely add a lot of humor to the movie. 
user1: I really hated the scene where her parents died at sea. It was kind of messed up, leaving them orphans in a way, I know Elsa was older, but it seemed like there was no one to really guide them through their teenage years. I feel like there was something missing.
user1: I didn't understand why Anna had to have her memories of Elsa's magic erased. That seemed kind of dumb to me, like wouldn't it make more sense to keep them there, so she could learn from her mistake. Next time she wouldn't jump around so foolishly and quickly. 
user2: Agree with you but it was necessary for the movie. Actually Elsa's insecure was the main component of the drama. But maybe the history could be achieved in a different way as you mentioned. 
user1: I understand. I hate how they closed the doors and everything and just left them isolated. I feel like she wouldn't have been so insecure about her powers if they had been more supportive.
user2: Completely agree, trying to keep then apart and without knowing the reason is a bad decision. For sure they were creating problems for the future. 
user2: Isolation created on Elsa insecure to control her powers and makes Anna willing to fall in love for the first man she meets outside the castle. 
user1: Why do you think Elsa remained so distant from Anna even after they opened the doors for the coronation?
user2: Difficult to know, maybe because she knew that Anna loved her but at the same time was the purpose of so many troubles when they where child. Although it was no Anna's fault maybe Elsa was afraid to happen again. 
user2: Elsa tried to create the ice castle to stay alone as she was in her normal castle right
user1: I feel like if she had just been open about her powers and that her family hadn't hid it from the citizen's, that maybe someone could have helped her learn how to control them. She was so afraid that they'd learn about them, I think the biggest trigger for her was fear. If people had just known from the start, the Duke wouldn't have been able to label her a monster. I guess it all  had to happen for there to be a movie though. 
user1: She creates the ice castle to get away from everyone after her powers are accidentally released. If I remember correctly, Anna pulls off one of Elsa's gloves while she's upset and that's what causes it.
user2: That is right and she so used to be isolated that was the only thing she could looked for. 
user1: She was upset about Prince Hans proposing to her sister after they just met. I can't blame her, that was a dumb move.
user1: I really love the scene of Anna meeting Kristoff and their journey to find Elsa. Olaf is awesome.
user1: His whole scene where he sings about summer is hilarious. 
user2: That is right, and Hans' intentions were very suspicious since the begging. 
user2: For a moment I supposed he was really in love but it was not difficult to realize the real intention.
user2: Also the giant creature Marshmallow was very interesting. 
user1: Did you like the part where they get to the ice castle and Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart? Or did you have a favorite part in that scene?
user1: Yes! I loved the marshmallow creature. That thing was awesome. Definitely brought some action to the scene. What better way to get Anna and her companions to leave than to create a larger, more evil version of Olaf?
user2: No for sure this is the most surprising scene. And it is a turning point for the movie. 
user1: Hans is a creep. Locking Anna in a room to die was terrible. Not that his kiss would have saved her anyways.
user2: Yes for sure, and using the fear of the people he could created a lie that was going to destroy everyone. 
user1: I hate how he manipulated everyone into thinking Else would kill her own sister, while she's alive in a room in the castle. Such a scum bag move.
user2: Yes that is right
user2: I also hated that part.

conversation:
user1: Hi, how are you?
user1: Hello?
user2: Hi,
user2: I am good. How about you?
user2: Are you there?

conversation:
user1: I really liked this movie.
user2: Hi, Have seen the movie Frozen?
user1: Yes, I have.
user2: I too like it, though not the best Disney movie but was good
user1: I agree that it was one of the best animated musicals I've seen.
user2: The Music is pretty good in it, what do you say?
user1: I loved the music in it, it seemed timeless and classic.
user2: Which character did you like?
user1: I really love Elsa, but Anna has a more adventurous personality.
user2: Call me a nut, but i liked the Sven , the reindeer
user1: Oh I did too. I really liked Elsa's powers though as well.
user2: Yes true that, the animation was really good in here
user1: I liked the trolls as well, and it was sad that their parents died when they were just teenagers.
user2: The saddest part was she couldnt touch her little sister and had be frigid to her all the time
user1: Oh yes, that was sad. But, their sisterly bond kept them attached even at the worst of times.
user2: Yes, Kirsten Bell's voice was quite apt for Anna
user2: What was your fav scene?
user1: When they decide to have the coronation and Anna is singing about how wonderful it's going to be, with all the people and chocolate!
user2: I liked the parts between Elsa and the Kristoff
user1: When they were developing their relationship? I did too.
user2: Yes, and the Sisters bond was very well depicted
user1: I agree completely. That was the main drive of the movie, I think.
user2: Yes, that was the Main point, 
user1: Glad we agree. I really liked the character Olaf, too.
user2: Yes very much, he added the fun element to the movie something similar to the Donkey in Shrek
user1: Yeah, except less sarcastic. I was sad when Elsa froze Anna's heart.
user2: It was heart breaking to watch the elder get rigid, but she did it for her sister
user1: Yeah, to protect her, I know, but I think Elsa was just scared.
user2: It was overall a good Movie... Nice talking to you

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user1: Hello! I hope you are well today. Have you heard of the movie Frozen?
user2: I have not heard of the movie Frozen, what is it about?
user1: It is about a fearless princess and her friends who try to find her estranged sister. Apparently the estranged sister has magical ice powers that trapped the whole town into an eternal winter. 
user1: Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 89%, which seems low compared to the Cinema Score of an A+
user2: wow that is a little weird that it has such a low score on rotten tomatoes
user2: Do they end up saving her sister?
user1: I'm not sure, I have to read further as it seems like my data does not tell me...
user1: I would assume so because it is a Disney movie 
user2: Oh, okay.
user2: that is true when does the hero not win in disney movies!
user2: do you think there will be a second movie?
user1: Apparently the sisters' parents die in a sea storm! How terrible. And very Disney. 
user1: I think there might be. Critics seemed to love it
user1: If Disney can make more money off of something then they're gonna do it. 
user2: I totally like that thinking!
user1: It was written to move directly to Broadway it seems, so there's another cash cow!
user2: so since this movie is a disney movie, im assuming its okay to show to all ages?
user1: I believe so
user1: Do you think you would watch it, even as an adult?
user2: who stars in the movie in terms of the voices for there character
user2: I think I would watch it, I love watching disney movies!
user1: Kristen Bell voices 18 year old Anna, Idina Menzel is Elsa, and Jonathan Groff voices Kristoff (Anna's friend)
user2: I am not really familiar with any of those names.
user2: do you think this movie is full of action?
user1: Excellent! I am all about watching movies about girls with crokinetic magic. 
user1: cryokinetic*
user2: how many movies have girls with cryokinetic magic?
user1: I think there is some action in it. The parents die towards the beginning, and Elsa the Ice Queen turns the entire town into an ice crazy town. 
user1: Not too many battles but some cool special effects. 
user2: I admire special effects!
user1: I think there is only one movie with a girl with cryokinetic powers haha.
user2: haha and do you think this movie has any comedy in it?
user1: Critics say the middle of the movie is a bit jokey, so I'd say somewhat. 
user1: It was a pleasure talking to you today!

conversation:
user2: Hello. Have you seen the movie Frozen by chance? One of the best animated musicals to come from Disney in many years. 
user1: I didn't care for Olaf
user1: Fair point, the music was good 
user2: Did you like the animation at all? Pretty smooth work from Disney.
user1: Yeah but they did that face thing where everyone looks the same.
user2: Eh they do that to save time and money. Didn't really come off all that bad for this movie.
user1: It made making the merch easier, that's for sure. :)
user2: It gets people interested in it. All the toys, dresses and cups... 
user1: Disney definitely wants to draw in the next gen and keep that legacy going.
user2: Yeah and still keeping the old gen with the Musical coming to Broadway (soon tm?)
user1: Broadway is where they found Idina (Elsa's VA) so that's a whole full circle thing
user2: Her voice actor was pretty awesome!
user2: Clear voice and decent tone range to.
user1: ... as long as she's not outside in the cold, or thrown off by Travollta. But I digress.
user1: My pitch for a sequel would be Elsa vs. Charlie from Firestarter. Cryokinesis vs. pyrokinesis. 
user2: I'd kind of like to see Elsa vs the girl from Brave
user1: Her hair would look so weird frozen stiff! :p
user2: Would turn curly stiff! Too much hair spray. :)
user2: Still think when Elsa turns 21 she will make a decent Queen. Albeit a little Cold hearted! 
user1: I know her parents weren't planning on yknow, dying, but they could have still left some instructions on the whole kingdom thing
user2: No one really plans on dying but yeah a little instruction book on how to run a kingdom might of come in handy
user1: Also, maybe a note or two on 'the trolls can probably help with the cryokinesis.' But then we wouldn't have the movie
user2: I just wish Elsa didn't feel so bad hurting her sister with the cryokinetic magic
user1: i wish Marshmallow had had more screen time. 
user2: I think he had a decent amount of screen time. Kept him sort of mysterious? 
user1: True.
user2: Kind of upsetting when he chased anna away though....
user1: He was doing what he was made for, sadly. Poor Elsa

conversation:
user2: Have you seen the movie Frozen
user1: Yes I have seen that movie.
user2: The are some good actor providing the voices
user1: I agree. They did quite well
user2: It wasn't what I expected but it was a great movie.  Didn't you think so?
user1: Yes, and I liked the moral of the movie.
user1: good lessons in there
user1: did you like the moral of the movie?
user2: Definitely was.  I did like the moral of the movie
user2: Disney always does such a great job
user1: I agree. I think there was a part 2 of the movie too. 
user2: YEah, I believe there was
user2: I would like to see it.
user2: I remember reading The Snow Queen when I was young
user1: I do not know what the Snow Queen is.  Is it the same story line?
user2: PRetty much the same.  It was a little more scary from what I remember.
user2: You should read it
user1: It sounds interesting. I might have to give that a try.
user2: Disney does a good job of also writing in sad moments in the movie. This had some of those
user1: yes, and in a way that helps kids cope i think
user2: Probably so.  
user2: Frozen also helps kids see that you can be very different but still love each other
user1: and accept each other's "faults".  too
user2: absolutely
user2: I like Sven the reindeer
user1: yes he's cute and funny
user2: But the marketing for the Frozen products is insane.  Everything is so expensive
user1: Yes! i'm thankful my little girl didn't really get into that. She likes the movies, but she never really goes crazy over a certain character. 
user2: Mine did.  The movie had it's exciting and suspenseful parts too
user1: I like a lot of the music the most.  all of the songs were great
user2: YEs, they are.  My daughter sings them quite often
user1: So, i wonder how we are supposed to end this?
user1: I want to veg out and watch a movie now
user2: Seriously, me too

conversation:
user2: So frozen was released in 2013
user2: It got a pretty good rotten tomatoes rating 
user1: Frozen was released in 2013 and released by Disney Pictures.
user1: No, it did not. It was the best animated musical Disney released.
user1: Kristen Bell played Anna's role really well.
user1: Frozen is a great film, do you know that it was inspired by one of Hans Christian Andersen tales?
user1: Hey, you were right about the "rotten tomatoes rating". I looked it up and did see that they were dinged.
user1: Do you like Animated films?
user1: What about 3D animated film? those are my favorites.

conversation:
user2: HI there!
user1: Hello. How are you?
user2: Good, thank you and yourself?
user2: So, have you seen Frozen, or rather, did your kids see Frozen:-)?
user1: I have seen Frozen once and then only bits and pieces of it. How about you?
user1: Did you see it?
user2: I have seen it at leas five times:-), it came out when my daughter was six, so we watched it a lot!
user1: What did you like about it?
user2: It's sort of inspired by the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen, I loved the music!
user2: Especially the main Let It go Song by Demi Lovato at the end!
user2: I know the movie is for the kids but the Let It Go theme song definitely resonates with adults, great lyrics!
user1: My son for a school review sang a duet from the movie. The music is very inspirational.
user2: Yes, it is! Very uplifting lyrics, makes you think of all the baggage left in the past and moving forward!
user1: I think that Kristen Bell makes the character very real.
user2: I also liked the animation and character portrayal, very cool designs!
user1: I know most kids like Olaf. Who is your favorite character?
user2: I love Elsa, so much drama and so pretty and glamorous! 
user2: How about you?
user1: Oh, Elsa was wonderful along with her boyfriend!
user2: And Kristoff is very humorous!
user1: I do like that the women seemed to take the lead. What do you think of the sister?
user2: Anna with red hair?! Very sweet and innocent, a striking contrast to her sister who is always gloomy and dramatic-they are like fire and ice!
user1: Elsa is very dramatic.  I thought the casting was perfect.
user2: It was nice talking to you and thanks for completing this task with me! I think we did 12 + exchanges as per instructions of the survey, I hope you have a great day!
user1: I am not sure that we did the 12+  Was there anything else that you liked or didn't like about the movie?  I know they are making it into a Broadway show.
user2: They are? That would be good, I know they did Beauty and the Beast and Lion King but Frozen would be amazing!
user2: They just need to pick the right voices for the show
user2: Definitively get the same actress/voice for Elsa!
user1: So often they try to pick actors that resemble the movie types. I would love to see the show.
user2: Yes!
user2: I grown-up movie version would be good too!
user1: Had you known the story of the Snow Queen previously to seeing this movie?
user2: Yes, loved it as a child! One of my favorites and my grandmother read it to me all the time
user1: I had not read it but I will now! Thank you!

user1: Hi
user1: My kids love this movie
user2: Hello
user1: I don't believe its the best disney movie but it was popular
user1: Are you there??? Say something. The faster you respond the faster we can be done.
user2: Are you still there?
user1: I still can't believe it was made in 2013. Seems like a long time ago.
user1: I'm going to abort the conversation in the next 1 minute if I don't get a response.

conversation:
user2: frozen is a musical animation movie
user1: That's true. I really enjoyed it. Kristen Bell does a great job playing Anna.
user2: it also won an oscar award for let it go song
user2: elsa played a snow queen role
user1: That's great. It's going to be a great Broadway musical in the future.
user1: Yeah, Idina Menzel was wonderful as Elsa.
user2: jonathan groff also played an important role with the snow man olaf
user1: I think Jonathan Groff actually played Kristoff, an iceman.
user2: yes 
user1: Did you know that it is based off a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale?
user2: forzen is one of the most grossed animated movie
user1: That's interesting. It's sad that the movie starts off with the death of the King and Queen, though.
user2: yeah but it ends well with both sister getting close to each other again
user1: That's good, since they start out with a rift between them as kids.
user1: What is your favorite part?
user2: favorite part - do you wanna build a snow man song :P
user2: and yours favorite part?
user1: I like the trolls. Did you know the main one who heals Anna at the beginning is called the Grand Pabbie?
user2: no
user1: I feel bad for Elsa when she accidentally sets off eternal winter and the Duke calls her a monster.
user2: yes me too... but When she is finally on her own, she finds beauty in herself. 
user2: Elsa sings the now Oscar-nominated "Let it Go" upon realizing that she is good enough for herself, and that's all that really matters.
user1: That's true. She creates her own palace, just for herself.
user2: Elsa proclaims that her freedom and ability to be herself without compromise are more important to her than anything
user1: That's a lot for a twenty one year old. Good for her.
user1: It's nice that the act of true love is between sisters.
user2: i also like anna how disney potray her -  She's clumsy, knocks things over all through the castle and runs into horses
user1: They do a good job of characterization.
user2: and not to forget OLAF : the snowman elsa created during let it go song
user1: I also learned that the snow monster she created is named Marshmallow. Never knew that before.
user2: marshmallow lol
user2: ok enough of this chat.. 
user2: good to know you
user2: bye 
user1: That Hans sure is a jerk.

user1: yeah i like freezing things
user2: I like that its a musical too
user1: sad their parents die
user2: yeah thats intense
user1: elsa need to learn control
user2: oh for sure
user2: elsa becoming queen without having control of her powers is a bad idea
user1: yeah obviously haha
user2: elsa getting angry and unleashign her powers sounds cool
user1: yeah i bet its intense
user2: the duke sounds like a jerk
user1: yup definitely
user2: elsa seems kinda mean
user1: she should be nicer to anna
user2: hans is a jerk
user1: yeah how awful

user2: i like Elsa
user2: and you
user1: i don't feel particularly strongly, but i liked watching kristoff and his reindeer
user2: that's cool what did you think about the voice acting
user1: i thought it was great, probably the best part of the movie
user2: me too
user1: it's cool that they had so many voice actors for all the characters different ages
user2: yes what did you think of the first key scene
user1: i thought it was kind of weird that the parents didn't do anything about how distraught elsa was over her powers. what did you think?
user2: yeah that was pretty weird
user1: the trolls were an interesting concept though
user2: yeah what did you think about hans
user1: he was a very charming character at first
user2: how about anna
user1: she seems like a lot of the other disney princesses which is interesting how they pointed that out with elsa objecting to the proposal. what do you think about anna?
user2: i think that she was ok
user1: yeah. what was your favorite scene to see?
user2: i like the last bit form the end
user2: how about you
user2: anything else you enjoyed

conversation:
user1: Hello!
user1: Are you there?
user2: Yes hello
user1: Hello
user2: Have you seen Frozen?
user1: I have!
user1: Have you?
user2: Great, yes!
user2: What do you think of it?
user1: I actually really enjoyed it.
user1: How about you?
user2: Me too
user2: I saw it with my nieces who loooved it
user2: What is it about the move that you like?
user1: I saw it with one of my friends. We were some of the only non-parent adults in the theater, but it was worth it
user1: I liked the songs
user1: Very catchy
user2: Yes the music was really well done
user2: Im amazed at how popular it has become
user1: Same
user1: Though I guess people have moved on to other movies now :)
user2: Who was your favorite character?
user1: Anna
user2: Cool, I like Olaf :)
user1: Ha, Olaf was good too :)
user2: I think Kristen Bell was perfect for Anna though
user1: Yeah, I agree
user2: Do you think there were any good lessons for kids in the movie?
user1: I think there was a strong message about the importance of family
user1: though I don't think that really came through until the end
user1: how about you
user1: ?
user2: I liked the messages about expressing emotions
user1: Yes, that was good too
user2: I like the relationship between the sisters
user1: Yes, though I didn't find Elsa very likeable
user2: Yeah
user1: I did enjoy her singing, though :)
user2: I liked that she felt like she needed to stay isolated from everyone to protect them at first
user2: and how this changes throughout the movie
user2: what was your favorite song?
user1: I am glad that changes throughout the movie
user1: I think "do you want to build a snowman" was my favorite!
user1: it still gets stuck in my head today
user2: Yes very catchy <3
user1: what's your favorite?
user2: The other I really remembered is let it go
user2: I liked the reindeer song too :)
user1: haha yes :)a
user1: alright, i think it's time to go!

conversation:
user2: Hello, I didn't watch the movie did you?
user2: are you there?
user1: Yes.  It was a good animated movie.  One kids would really like
user2: Oh cool. I like anything animated. Is it a recent movie?
user1: It seems even the critics think so as it got an A+ score from CinemaScore.  I wouldn't call 2013 'recent' unless you are also into really old movies.  They casted Kristen Bell as Anna, though I really liked how Jonathan Groff played Kristoff.
user2: Oh haha, Frozen?
user1: I didn't realize it was Disney's 53rd feature film.  Glad they based it off a good author like Hans Christian Anderson.  A good story to start with makes for a good movie.
user1: Yup.
user2: I've seen a bit of it, I never decided to watch it in its entirety.
user2: Wow, 53 feature films!
user1: I know, right?!  Wondering when it will become a musical on broadway.  Not that I am one to go see them, but it seems to be the progress of things.
user1: I always wondered how different it would have turned out if they had not erased Anna's memories.  Poor Elsa, living with all that guilt.
user2: Haha I wonder too, that would be nice. Like you said earlier it is popular with kids. I'm more of an old-school Disney fan. I think the last Disney movies I've actively watched and thoroughly enjoyed were Toy Story and Monsters inc. but I'll still watch things like Fox and the Found and want to cry like a baby haha
user2: Elsa erased Anna's memories?
user2: Hound*
user2: How does she do that?
user1: If it wasn't for my kids, I wouldn't have seen this either.  They were actually too young when it came out, weren't really into watching movies.  Then a friend showed them the movie and I didn't hear anything else for days afterwards.  Could have used some of those memory erasing skills the trolls had.  The trolls erased Anna's memories of her sister's magical abilities in order to save her life.
user1: The trolls warned her not to use her magic or it might trigger Anna's memories to come back, thereby undoing what was done to keep her from freezing.  So, instead of mastering her snow/cold skills, Elsa hid them.  She came to see them as something horrible and wrong.
user2: Hahaha that is cute about your kids. Ah, I see. So does Elsa eventually train herself or it ends before she can do that?
user1: It didn't help matters any when the parents ended up dying at sea, leaving Elsa to enter adulthood without them there to support and guide her.  It really is a good story line, though obviously aimed at kids.
user2: Sounds enjoyable too from a fiction-lover's perspective. Anything with spells and stuff like that is pretty great to me.
user1: Well, when she came up age at 21, she had not yet mastered the skill and the citizens of her kingdom didn't know about it. 
user1: She continues to try and hid it, meanwhile Anna can't figure out what she did wrong to make her sister suddenly stop wanting to play with her, to make her (Elsa) so up tight.  Then come in the standard guy - handsome, saves the day.  but then yet another twist - turns out his only goal is to marry Elsa so he can kill her and take over the kingdom.
user2: oh no ):
user1: My bad, I meant, he was looking to marry Anna, though he did want to take over the kingdom.
user2: that's horrible I hope she doesn't marry him
user2: Do you think this movie is better than Wreck-It Ralph? I just remembered I liked that Disney movie and I think they came out the same year or around the same year not sure.
user1: Well .... :)  Elsa and Anna have an argument over something, Elsa releases her powers in a moment of anger, sees what she has done, and flees to the mountains thinking everyone will think she is a monster.  What she doesn't realize is that she has now created an eternal winter over the kingdom.
user1: hmm.  I think it depends on what you are going for.  I liked the ending to Wreck it Ralph better.  Frozen ended with an untraditional scene, the love between sisters saving the day.  
user1: As a movie for kids, I think they will have enough years ahead of them for romantic movies, I like to see ones which encourage friendships and helping others.
user2: Yea definitely. Love Disney for their messages, always have.
user2: Kids don't look that in depth into their behavior unless they're entertained by cutesy sing along stuff
user1: The speed of the newer Disney movies seems to be faster than that of the older ones, even Fox and Hound.  In that, I think the newer ones are not necessarily better as they do not give time for the viewers to solve things on their own or consider what might happen.
user1: exactly
user2: at least kids nowadays
user2: i dunno interesting thought haha cause and effect maybe?
user2: Disney movies when we were kids weren't as stimulating
user2: but they definitely made us feel something
user2: still
user2: I hope Disney doesn't want to dumb our kids down, because they definitely know how to grab their attention. You never know in this world today.
user1: Definantly different animation. The in this movie were more realistic than say, oh, what is the one with Mickey Mouse and the magician and the dancing brooms.
user2: Yea definitely more attention to every little detail etc
user1: That is one thing I did like about this movie, when you thought you had figured out who was going to give "true love's kiss" to save Anna (i.e. the guy), it turns out it came from her sister.  It really did make even me stop and think about assumptions.
user1: That love is not a shallow feeling, but something deeper.  It may have been lost on the kids though.  I know my son did appreciate that there were no kissing scenes.
user2: That's great actually! I remember as a kid my younger sister loved watching Pocahontas and singing to it all the time, and I as a brother put up with it because I was a pretty nice brother, so maybe its like that. 
user2: Haha I tend to make a lot of assumptions about movies. I wasn't even born in the 80s but I appreciate things from 80s-2000 a lot more than anything after.
user1: If you were looking for something to watch with some younger kids, or perhaps something no too heavy yet no shallow, it wouldn't be a bad choice.  There were several comical scenes.
user2: Yea. I mean at some point I'll probably watch it. I watched Tangled in its entirety for some reason.
user1: Particularly, I like Kristoff.  Perhaps it is because he is the outdoorsy type, made me miss being out in the woods.  Had absolutely nothing to do with the movie, though is character is hard not to like.
user1: LOL  okay, I think it is better than Tangled.
user2: Nice
user2: Did you see Happy Feet?
user2: I don't think that was Disney, but I liked it.
user1: I did.  Loved it, till the end.  I may be a lover of nature but did not appreciate the in-your-face environmentalism added, didn't seem to fit.
user2: Oh yeah..
user2: they tanked the ending
user2: like how sausage party tanked their ending don't know if you saw that
user1: No, didn't see that one.
user2: Don't! Haha unless you are willing to be distracted from normal thoughts for a couple days.
user2: It just made me walk around shaking my head wondering what I watched until I could block it out
user1: I will take your word for it.
user1: Thanks for the heads up.
user2: Haha :P for sure
user2: anyways don't know if you noticed but you can click finish convo at the end
user2: it was nice talking to you, thanks for conversation
user2: definitely was interesting 
user1: You too, have a great evening.
user2: you too thanks!!

conversation:
user2: Hi there!
user1: Hey
user2: So we're going to be talking about Frozen. Have you seen it?
user1: What movie are we talking about
user1: Yes
user1: You like it
user2: I think it's a very strong movie, definitely one of the best Disney movies in recent memory.
user1: Yeah great movie
user2: All of the actors and actresses were great, especially Idina Menzel
user1: Yeah she can sing
user2: Definitely, Let It Go was inescapable
user2: I think it was a really interesting story with a lot of life lessons about being yourself
user1: Yes g
user1: Yes
user1: Let go yeah lolol
user2: I didn't know it was the 53rd Disney animated movie, that's crazy
user1: Yes
user2: The original story The Snow Queen is really interesting too
user1: Yeah she was 
user2: I've often felt like Elsa, wanting to build an ice palace and live away from people
user1: Great part 
user2: Very emotional
user1: Yes
user2: The 3D effects were really cool too
user1: 3d was look
user1: Cool I mean 
user2: Agreed
user2: There were so many twists in the story too
user1: Yes
user2: It almost looked like it was going to be an unhappy ending
user1: Yes

conversation:
user2: I did not know that Anna's voice was played by 3 actresses during the Frozen movie.
user2: I correct myself, there were 4 voices played as Anna.
user2: What was the plot of the Frozen movie?
user1: I didn't know that either. I was surprised to learn that Anna, Elsa and Kristoff were voiced by multiple actors
user1: Frozen is the story of a princess who sets off on a journey with a snowman and a reindeer to find her estranged sister
user2: Strangely enough, it is based on a fairy tale called "The Snow Queen".
user2: I wonder what other movies that Idina Menzel also acted in.
user1: I'm not sure about that, do you agree with the critics that Frozen is a terrific family movie?
user2: I think it does have great comedy and adventure elements to the movie and I like it.
user1: Did you enjoy the music?
user2: I did enjoy the musical performances. How about you?
user1: I did find the songs very catchy and that they stayed with me throughout the day. 
user1: The story of how the sisters became estranged is very sad, what did you think about it?
user2: I remember the scene where Elsa was playing with Anna and she accidentally hurt Anna and then they were separated as they grew up.
user2: It was sad but it adds to the story.
user1: Yes, it was very important to the story. Do you think the king and queen did the right thing by separating the girls/
user1: ?
user2: Not to mention Elsa had suppressed her magic as she was growing up. The king and queen were probably trying their best interest for safety
user2: Then, Elsa reaches 21 and then she unleashes her powers as a result of Anna's love interest.
user1: Why do you think Elsa objected to the proposal?
user2: I guess she didn't want to feel lonely and afraid.
user1: That makes sense, it's too bad because she ended up alone in a palace of ice anyway
user2: The castle Elsa built of ice was beautiful but cold.
user1: and far away from the kingdom
user2: I wonder what Elsa did while being alone in that ice castle.
user2: Then Anna finds Elsa and then her heart becomes frozen
user1: That was very exciting when Elsa froze Anna's heart
user1: I was very surprised to learn that Hans was actually plotting against the sisters
user2: Shocking in my opinion. Hans was setting his sights on the throne.
user1: He was going to have both sisters killed, but one managed to escape
user2: That is true. Anna's hair was turning white from the spell as well.
user1: Yes, because she was freezing from the inside
user2: the "act of true love" was supposed to break the spell
user1: Yes, without hans it will be hard to break the spell

conversation:
user2: hi there
user1: Hi, this movie was a fascinating one to watch
user2: Yes i know , its  perfect to watch it with kids , ts a cute story about 2 sisters .
user1: I had no idea it was based on the Hans Christian Anderson tale "The Snow Queen"
user2: Year its basically about a princess that has icy powers kind of makes sense why it was inspired by The Snow Queen
user1: The plot does remind me a little bit of other movies where the characters are trapped in winter
user2: Walt Disney Animation Studios always make beautiful movies for kids i am very pleased and thankful for that they never fail to make a good animation movie 
user1: Yes it's amazing to think that the same people who made the movies I loved as a kid are still making movies for kids today
user2: Yeah its really nice how they come up with things that catches kids attention and at the same time it teaches them something , for example this movie can give a great understanding that is about love , and helping others.
user1: yes, its great that they can teach kids lessons without them even realizing it
user2: yea exactly , specially if its comedy like this one
user1: It's interesting that they work the theme of parental death into the film
user2: i just find it amazing how they can just come up with ideas and bring it live . 
user1: Yes the creativity is astounding. I have no idea how they come up with the people who can create something so great
user2: Yess , overall very interesting and beautiful movie i would say. Its maybe why  they scored it an  A+ movie
user1: True. Another one of my favorite aspects is that it's two females who are the leaders in the film, giving little girls something to look up to
user2: yes and its amazing that a men directed it , also other movies like the little mermaid was given created by a man which its nice that you might think a women can come up with this ideas but also men
user1: When I think about the complexity of the plot as the two sisters get older, it's amazing to me that even children can follow along and enjoy this
user2: It helps by giving kids the comfort to know that imagination its beautiful , its definitely a movie that will be very known for years 
user1: It makes me wonder how this movie has truly affected children at the deepest levels. I feel that when so many children obsessively watch this movie over and over again and watch elsa run and isolate herself after failure and such, if it affects them on a subconscious level
user2: yes ofcourse i totally agree
user1: So was Elsa jealous of Annas relationship deep down? it seems that this happens often with sisters
user2: no i dont think i think they were both trying to help eachother out somehow , just keep in mind that Anna went to look for her sister it dindt matter much what had happened. I am glad this movie only recieved positive critics
user1: I am glad, like so many other movies, that there is the villain Hans. Kids need to learn early that there are bad people out there and not everyone can be trusted
user2: Definitely
user1: I am wondering how Anna escapes from the detention cell
user2: she has magical powers , i dont think escaping  would be something hard for her
user1: That is a good point. Like they so often do, a man has once again underestimated a woman

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: I didn't know that they had someone else sing instead of using the same actress for the speaking 5 year old Anna
user2: Yes, I still enjoyed the movie though. The singing was pretty good.
user2: The animation was really great as well. I really got lost in the movie.
user1: In some ways, it does remind me of Beauty and the Beast, the Little Mermaid and other earlier movies.
user2: Yes, that is definitely true. It is a great family movie that a whole family can enjoy of all ages.
user2: I really enjoyed the reindeer in the movie. So cute.
user1: I love that it was based on Hans Christian Andersen.  I just wish that more parents knew how to relate new movies back to the classics to show their children that the classics are still relevant.
user2: Definitely. I give the movie 5 stars.
user1: I agree.  The CinemaScore was A+, and that's wonderful.  I don't think that the Metacritic score of 74/100 was high enough.
user2: Yes, definitely should have been higher.
user1: Idina Menzel was a stunning choice for Elsa, but do you think Kristen Bell was bold enough for Anna?
user2: Yes, Kristen did a great job. 
user2: I enjoyed the bits of comedy in the movie.
user2: I loved the magic in it.
user1: I did have a few issues with the movie.  The concept that parents would choose to hide things from one sister, to the point of erasing her memory, is scary to children.
user2: Yes, but they can always watch the movie again when they get older and then they might understand it better.
user2: It's a great fantasy film.
user1: I also think that seeing two sisters so estranged is setting up some children for issues.
user2: Yes, but it does reflect upon real life as well as fantasy.
user1: And when a child sees that someone suppresses an issue instead of dealing with it, it's not a healthy coping mechanism
user2: True. I agree.
user2: At least she was healed though.
user2: I'm glad she tried to control her magic.
user1: I hated that Anna supposedly fell in love in one night.
user2: It was sad indeed that the parents died. 
user2: Well at least she tried.
user1: I understand having the parents die when the girls were teens.  While sad, they weren't integral to the plot.
user2: Yes. They were just a small part of the movie.
user2: It's hard to believe it has been 5 years since it's release, seems like only yesterday 
user1: I liked that they chose something out of fantasy (Elsa's magic) as the focus of discrimination.  It allows every child to see that discrimination can be about anything, and it allows them to learn to sympathize and empathize in a way that won't scare them.
user2: Yes, the movie has great lessons.
user2: I thought the trolls were a little silly.
user2: I thought the castle was really beautiful.
user1: I liked that accidents were treated as accidents, not as things done on purpose.  I also liked that there was no difference between whether the problem was accidental or on purpose
user2: Yes, I enjoyed those parts of the movie.
user2: It does have some scary parts though. Gave me a little anxiety during the film.
user1: I can understand how parts scare children, especially when Hans lies about Elsa killing Anna.
user2: Yes, I had a hard time with that. Mind games are never a good thing.
user1: I also think the trolls were very silly.  But very young children could learn lessons from them more easily than they could from the more serious characters.
user2: At least the movie had some adventure. I don't expect every movie to be perfect and go as one hopes.
user2: Yes, the trolls were pleasing.
user1: I agree with that estimation.  I loved that they phrased it as "an act of true love" without specifying

conversation:
user2: Hi! I think you will really enjoy the movie Frozen.
user1: Cool, what kind of movie is it?
user2: It is a animated comedy that was made in 2013.
user1: I like animation. what age group is it for?
user2: It is great for the whole family and has earned great reviews.
user1: Sounds good. Do you know if it is on any of the cable TV channels yet?
user2: I am not sure if it is or not. 
user2: It's made by Disney, so very likely that it will be on regular television.
user1: Ok, thanks for the information. I will be sure to check it out.
user2: I'm sure you will really enjoy it. It stars Kristen Bell as the voice of Princess of Arendelle.
user1: I'm not sure who Kristen Bell is but I usually enjoy Disney animations. Maybe I can watch it with my children.
user2: They will really enjoy it. There are some great scenes where Princess Elsa shows her magic and accidentally hurts her sister while they are playing.
user1: I like stuff with magic in it. Hope her sister didn't get hurt bad! LOL
user2: She ends up being okay, but now Princess Elsa needs to figure out how to control her magic and her and her sister fight more often.
user1: Sibling rivalry. Sounds very interesting. The kids will enjoy it. I will have to make some time to watch it with them.
user2: Yes, they will really enjoy it. The reviews are amazing.
user1: Sounds like a lot of stuff about girls. Do you think boys will like it too?
user2: Yes, I really do think boys will like it too. It has action as well. 
user1: Great, it will be fun for the entire family then. How long is the movie?
user2: It is the perfect length. The 3D computer-animation is also a musical, so the kids will sing along. 
user1: Kids do love musicals. I will have to get some popcorn and candy ready!
user2: Yes, Idina Menzel sings as Elsa and she got great reviews. 
user1: Is it called Frozen because they live in the snow?
user2: There are scenes where they are in the ice palace and Elsa even accidentally freezes Anne's heart at one point.
user1: Wow seems a little scary. 
user2: Another great scene that captivates the whole family. 

conversation:
user2: So Frozen
user2: Have you seen it?
user1: do you want to build a snowman?
user1: lol, yes I have, many times :)
user2: I'm sure everyone with a kid has a million times lol
user1: yes, my favorite characters are Sven and then the snowman, I can't recall his name
user1: very cute movie and it's not bad for a musical
user2: Olaf
user2: The songs in it are definitely memorable
user1: Olaf! that's it! he is funny!
user2: I didnt know it was inspired by the Snow Queen fairytale
user1: I did not know that either
user1: the thing is that scene where she hurts her sister was one of my favorites, wheh she was buidling things really quickly
user2: Oh yeah. It also shows how if you try to spupress a part of you it just grows beyond your control
user2: They really got you to care about the character also
user1: are they saying there will be a frozen on broadway?
user1: or had it already happened and I missed it?
user2: I think they are saying it is set up so they can easily adapt it to broadway
user2: I had not heard anything yet about it being done though
user1: okay, thought perhaps I missed lol
user2: I would like to see a sequel where we can see more about Elsa's ability once she masters it
user1: right or like the town and its people becoming ok with her powers
user1: realizing she is not a "monster"
user2: Yeah, really accepting her as the queen
user2: Hans is a definitive Disney villain
user1: oh i forgot about Han's, hes the evil one right?
user2: Definitely
user2: They really gave him good reason to be the way he is 
user1: A sequel is definitely needed!
user1: i mean imagine a guy proposing to your sister after just meeting
user1: id be like he is up to NO good
user2: True. It is a frachise I am sure they will make more of
user2: Have a good day :)

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hi
user1: Have you seen the animated movie Frozen?
user1: The songs were so popular!

conversation:
user2: Such a good movie.  Did you enjoy it?
user1: I did enjoy the movie, it was fun and unique
user2: It's amazing how far 3D computer-animated musical fantasy films have come.
user1: It had some really catchy tunes
user2: Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell have amazing voices.
user1: I remember the days of old school movies like the lion king; how technology has changed
user2: Some have said this is Disney's best animated musical since The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
user1: I agree it is in the to 10, but it is hard to beat the classics
user2: It got an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes.  That's pretty good.
user1: The cinescore was A+ which is pretty impressive
user1: The movie definitely had a dark streak to it
user2: Yeah, that scene early on about hurting her sister and then being told to keep her powers under control leading her to insecurity...  Deep.
user1: Or when her parents died; had parallels to other Disney movies
user2: I suppose that is a common theme in a lot of fairy tales.  I heard this one was based on a Hans Christian Andersen tale.  Parents dying at sea...  That would have screwed me up as a kid.
user1: Frozen had some dark themes; I was scared at some points, it's amazing that it was suited so much to kids
user2: Reindeer and trolls... and cold... so Scandinavian.
user1: Trolls are scary; but I love the magic elements
user2: I like how the movie shows bits of their lives growing up.
user1: I like the different types of magic used
user2: Eternal winter and ice palaces.  It is kind of a shame she had to hide her magic and couldn't just use it for the good of Arendelle.
user1: I completely agree.
user2: The Duke was kind of mean.
user1: Her sister was mean for sure
user2: "True love" is always the cure!
user1: Ofcourse!
user2: And that Hans... Such a bad guy.  I thought he was going to be good.
user1: yes, but that was a good turn of events
user2: And the name Marshmallow...  That doesn't seem to come directly from the fairy tale.
user1: It was a refreshing character for sure
user1: Someone unexpected and unique
user1: Marshmallow from Ghostbusters; haha.
user2: I'm glad everything works out in the end and we could all leave feeling good.
user1: I agree, it was a great heartwarming ending.
user2: I'd probably give it a 93%.
user1: id give it a solid 90
user2: I look forward to Frozen 2.
user1: it'll be interesting to see the next chapter and where they go
user2: I'm sure they've got something cooking.
user1: I'm sure Disney does
user2: It's been nice chatting with you.
user1: Same to you!

conversation:
user1: hello there!
user2: hi
user1: so, about that movie, what's it called?

user1: what's the plot?
user2: The story tells about a princess who set off a journey with a snow man
user1: A journey where?

user1: Does she find her?
user2: Yes 
user1: Is the sister lost?
user2: No her sister run away from home 
user1: why did she run?
user2: Because elsa has a special icy power and sometimes she can’t control it and she’s afaid she will hurt her sister anna 
user1: and where does the snow man come in to the plot?
user1: are you still there?
user1: hello
user1: still there?
user1: abort?

conversation:
user1: Frozen is said to be one of the best Disney movies ever. What do you think
user2: It's an interesting story and I bet kids love it.
user1: The songs are really catchy, too. Very much Broadway-style.
user2: I would really love to see the broadway play.
user1: Did you know that it was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen?" I had no idea.
user2: Nope, I didn't. Did you like that pet reindeer? I sure did!
user1: Yes, Sven! So cute - it's funny how a character with no lines can be so funny! Who was your favorite character?
user2: I think the snowman was great.
user1: Yes, Olaf is so fun. Did you think the movie deserved its rave reviews?
user2: Absolutely, kids loved it and it was interesting for adults as well.
user1: I definitely agree. It's one movie that I think everyone can enjoy. I know my kids could watch it over and over.
user2: Did you understand the magic? I didn't quite get it.
user1: I don't think they ever really explained how Elsa got her powers. That was a little confusing.
user2: Yeah it was. Do you think it is in the top 5 of best Disney movies?
user1: I think I would say so. I'm partial to the Disney movies of the 90s, but I think that it's absolutely on par with them.
user2: Eva Bella was great, what do you think?
user1: I'm not sure who that is - is that also from Frozen?
user2: Yeah she voiced Elsa.
user1: Oh! I didn't realize - she was the little girl Elsa. She was cute! I loved Idina Menzel as older Elsa. Her voice is so powerful.
user2: It really is, she lights up every scene with her voice.
user1: For sure! Although, I LOVED Kristen Bell as Anna. I had no idea she could sing. What was your favorite song?
user2: I don't remember the name but the iconic song was really great, couldn't get it out of my head for months.
user2: Do you know what it was called?
user1: Oh, Let it Go? It's such an earworm. 
user1: Is that the one?
user2: Yeah, let it go.
user1: Good choice! I loved it, too!
user2: Yup it was really great.

conversation:
user2: Frozen is a animated movie that they tells about the princess.
user1: That was such a great movie!  The snowman was my favorite!  Which character was your favorite?
user2: The prince was my favourite and its really a awesome movie.
user1: I agree.  I liked the comedy part in the middle of the movie.  Didn't you think the jokes were funny?
user2: Not like that. Its really good to see and great entertainment. did u think the movie was emothinal?
user1: I did think it was emotional, the beginning and end were the most emotional for me.
user1: This movie got great ratings, I would see it again.  Would you see it again?
user2: Ya its true. Because the movie said about the prince and her life journey
user2: Ya i agreed too.
user2: i will never get bore to see again.
user1: Me neither.  Are you typically a fan of animation?
user2: yes. i love animation movies.
user1: Me too.  This story line was amazing though.  Did the part when the sister's lost their parents make you sad?  I almost cried.
user2: did u think that injure was planned by her sister?
user1: I don't think so, it looked like an accident.
user1: Why do you think Elsa shut out her sister?
user2: Ya. i think she love her sister 
user2: she had more powers
user1: When they opened the gates for the crowning, I bet the sisters were nervous.  Wouldn't you be nervous if you hadn't had visitors in years?  I know I would!
user2: i think i would. was Elsa feel more insecure? if u tell yes the do u know y
user2: if you tell yes tgen do you knw the reason?
user1: I think she would feel more insecure.  The pressure is on and she has to try to control her powers.  It would be hard to handle.
user1: I did not like the scene when Elsa accidentally unleashed her powers and put Arendelle in an eternal winter because I felt really bad for Elsa.  How did that scene make you feel?
user2: i agree. if she liked to do some little work then it would become a big issue.
user1: Oh my gosh, when Elsa accidentally froze Elsa's heart I could not believe it!  Can you imagine how she must have felt in that moment?
user1: I am sorry, when Elsa froze Anna's heart.
user2: if i am a Anna's place On that time we dont know about that feel. if we did for our siblings OMG cant imagine
user2: what will be your reaction?
user1: Yes I agree!  Gosh I am not sure what my reaction would be,  I'd be heartbroken and disappointed that's for sure.
user1: The actors did such a great job in this movie.  I had no idea Kristen Bell was the voice of Anna, did you?
user2: I am not sure about that. 
user2: do you know about tha anna boyfriend?
user1: Anna's boyfriend that she met in the middle of the movie was terrible.  I thought he was a good guy until the end.  I was so angry!
user2: I think he was a good soul for her and you said that he was a good guy. then why you get angry
user1: At the end he confessed he was trying to take over the kingdom and he captured Anna.  I was shocked, weren't you?
user2: did you think that his love was fake?
user1: I do, it had to have been.  No other reason he would betray her the way he did.  I am just glad she escaped from the cell.  
user2: are you speaking about anna or elsa?
user1: Oh, I am talking about Anna.  He locked her up and tried to trick the people into believing that Elsa killed Anna.  Is that just terrible?
user2: ya okay. sorry for that. but it was not planned by elsa
user1: No, Elsa did not do anything wrong.  Anna's fake boyfriend lied.
user1: Hans was definitely the bad guy in the story, don't you think?
user2: Correct. do you think that the end of the story was satisfied you?
user1: You know the story line was so good that I have to say yes.  Did it satisfy you?
user2: Definitely. it satisfied a lot
user2: finally it was a superb movie.
user1: Well I am glad we saw the movie.  Let's talk later.  Bye.
user2: sure. see it again. bye

conversation:
user1: What do you think of frozen
user2: the greatest sing-a-long for kids to enjoy
user2: hbu? 
user1: It was good when it was released but it's popularity is unwavering. This frankly surprises me.  
user1: ironically people never let it go
user2: I would agree. What was your favorite scene from the movie? 
user1: when Anna met Kristoff he kinda represents the every man who knows more of the real world than she does
user1: he asks the questions about her so called love for her prince
user2: oh ok. Do you agree with the cinema score?
user1: some what yeah. 
user1: But people today hype the darn thing
user2: haha.. they don't know how to "let it go"
user1: They never do
user2: what do you think of the opening scene ?
user1: Interesting 
user2: would you say that set the tone for the movie?
user1: They could of build the older sister's personality rather than hold her in a room
user1: kind of unrealistically set the tone
user2: yes, it was a captive way on holding on to how much anger she much had trapped inside of her
user1: more like fear instead of anger
user1: they should of made her more timid towards her sister
user2: yes, good catch. fear instead of anger.. I agree
user1: make her ironically over protective from being far away
user2: yeah , especially after their parents passed away. that was all she had
user1: could of made film about Elisa fear the use of her powers in a different way
user2: haha, yeah but then Frozen 2 came out 
user1: Really?
user1: I would of known about it
user2: coming out* next year
user2: can you agree with the metacritics score 
user1: back when it came out yes. Now, It's over rated give it 75 
user2: understood.. do you like movies of this genre ?
user1: sometimes
user1: I do like disney movies from time to time
user2: what are some other favorites
user1: Alien. The series is now owned by Disney
user1: I do like toy story
user2: yes that's a favorite 
user2: what's a scene you did not like?

user2: oh ok

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Frozen sounds like a great movie. It's a Disney animated musical and has high ratings from critics.
user1: I haven't seen the movie. I really want to see it though.
user2: Have you heard the music? Idina Menzel sings the part of Elsa.
user1: Maybe I have. Is Elsa the main character?
user2: Elsa is one of the main cast members. The others are Anna, her younger sister, and Kristoff, an iceman.
user1: I think I've seen Kristoff. What country does the movie take place in?
user2: A kingdom called Arendelle
user1: Is that a ficitonal country?
user2: It is a fantasy film based on a fairy tale
user1: Nice. What year did the movie debut?
user2: In 2013
user1: Are they going to make a sequel?
user2: I don't know. One of the critics said it was destined for a Broadway show!
user1: That makes sense if it is that good. What is the moral of the movie?
user2: I'd say it's about mastering your powers rather than trying to suppress them.
user1: That resonates with me. I really want to see the movie now.
user2: If you like musical fantasy and princesses, I think you'd find a lot there.
user1: I agree.
user2: There is also a colony of magical trolls, which sounds cool.
user1: Sounds interesting.
user2: And it's Disney's 53rd animated feature film! They must be doing something right.
user1: Wow! 53. They are doing something right!
user2: There are actors in this film who play characters at different ages. I wonder if they are trying to broaden their appeal.
user1: They probably are. They don't want to be type-cast.
user2: I can understand that. I hate to tell you spoilers, but in this one the handsome prince turns out to be a bad guy!
user1: Really? That is surprising in a Disney movie.
user2: The directors are Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, I guess maybe they wanted something different
user1: I haven't heard of them. But if you say it is a good movie, they must be doing something right.

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you seen Frozen yet?
user2: Yes, I have. Have you?
user1: Yeah, I really enjoyed Idina Menzel's singing. Did you have a favorite actor?
user2: Yes, my favorite character in the movie is Anna herself.
user1: Oh I agree, she's a far stronger character, isn't she?
user2: Yes, she is very strong, going on the journey to find her sister was brave on her part.
user1: I had a hard time reconciling Kristen Bell's voice with what I knew about her then. She really can sing!
user2: It feels like watching a Broadway musical to be honest.
user2: Do you know what this movie is based on?
user2: It is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale called "The Snow Queen".
user1: Wow, I think the server is really slow, I just got all your essages at once.
user1: I thought I'd read something about that, but I don't know that I've ever read the original story. Have you?
user2: It can happen sometimes. And no, I haven't read that, either.
user1: What did you think of the role of the trolls in the movie? I was very conflicted about whether or not they were actually doing good for anna and elsa.
user2: You mean the rugged iceman or his loyal pet reindeer?
user2: Or are you talking about the naive snowman?
user1: No, the trolls that the parents took anna to see when they were kids and elsa accidentally blasted her with her magic
user2: I think it might have been important to their character development, for example ..
user2: After Grand Pabble heals Anna and cleared her memories, it must have taught Elsa to control her powers but also..
user2: That all magic can be reverted.
user1: Yeah, I can see that. I was just thinking that the troll wasn't really doing either girl any good by telling them to have elsa keep all bottled up.
user2: Yes, it created a rift between then, which was not good. 
user1: But now I think about it, I wonder, was that more of her parents' interpretation than the specific advice? 
user1: from the troll?
user1: I honestly cannot remember
user2: Could have been both but it didn't help, he should have taught Elsa to master her magic instead of keeping it bottled.
user1: I mean, I can see what all the little girls love Elsa as a character, but I think that she isn't as great of a role model as Anna.
user1: That is, if Elsa had learned to master her magic rather than ignore it, it would have been a very different story.
user2: I think she has much pride and arrogance since she knows that when she turns twenty-one she'll be the queen of Arendelle.
user1: At the same time, Anna continually reached out to Elsa, never wavering in her sisterly love
user1: That's an interesting point of view?
user1: Sorry, I didn't mean to add a ?
user2: I mean she does knows that she would be queen but only if the Duke doesn't finds about her powers, but that didn't happen, did it?
user1: Well, but I think she still gets to be queen, right? And the Duke was after Anna, wasn't he? If I remember correctly he was the 6th son or somethign and never really had a chance unless he married a princess
user2: Are you talking about Prince Hans of the Southern Isles?
user2: Because I think, he was the one plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both the sisters.
user2: You know the way he locks Anna in the room to die so the dignitaries think that Elsa killed her.
user2: But failed when Anna escapes from the detention cell.
user2: Still there..?
user2: It's been more than 5 minutes from your last response, I'll leave now.

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: hi
user1: The movie I have that I am recommending to you is Frozen
user2: Hmmm, okay. And why are you recommending it?
user1:  Because it was has an 89% rotten tomatoes score and Cinemascore of A+
user2: What is it about?
user2: Hello?
user1: It is a Comedy Adventure animation from Walt Disney. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Snow Queen", the film tells the story of a fearless princess who sets off on a journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer, and a naïve snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. 
user2: Sounds interesting
user2: But I dont have children, so I'm not sure if I really want to see a Disney film
user1: It has been reveiwed as one the best musicals to come from Disney since Beauty and the beast and little mermaid.
user2: I didn't see either of those films
user1: It is voice casted by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel 
user2: ok fine i will watch it
user1: Great. 
user1: Just so you know, "Frozen is both a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation ofDisney coming to terms with its own legacy and its own identity. It's also a just plain terrificbit of family entertainment.”
user2: ok. you have convinced me that I should at least view this film to stay relevent with bits of popular culture
user1: To give you a little insight into the movie here is some of a scene that takes place. 
user1: When Elsa turns twenty-one, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified thatthe kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear for her. The castle gatesopen to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Amongst them is thescheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whomAnna falls head-over-heels in love.
user2: I"m intrigued
user1: well Elsa’s coronation happens without a hitch, but she stillremains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentallyunleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees thekingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching theNorth Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of in which to live is a solitary life.
user1: I like it because it really does set up the plot of the movie well. 
user2: i see many parallels that could be drawn here to real life situations
user2: so maybe it isnt JUSt a childrens movie
user1: No its not. Thats why it was reviewed as being a potential  broadway play some day.
user2: maybe i will watch it to try to find all of the subtexts  
user1: Yes thats why it was given a metacritics score of 74/100
user2: sounds good
user1: yes it is because of the many twist the movie offers such as this scene.
user1: Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become ofArendelle, Elsa becomes agitated, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. She thensummons a giant snow creature named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olafaway. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the trolls, his adoptivefamily. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reversesthe spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and hismen reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow, and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered toHans, but rather than kissing her, he instead reveals that he has actually been plotting toseize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. He locks Anna in a room to die,and manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen'sexecution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
user2: wow
user1: i know, very gripping. THank you for your time.
user2: Thanks, you too

user2: Hello
user1: So did you read about a movie?
user2: Have you ever watched the Disney movie Frozen?
user1: Yes!
user2: I have as well.
user1: I loved it as much as anyone else. Do you feel it was as much of a musical as other Disney films?
user2: Yes I do, and I enjoyed it as well.
user2: Which was your favorite character?
user1: I liked it but I felt the beginning and middle was oversaturated with musical numbers in comparison with the last third of the movie, which had no music whatsoever.
user1: Definitely Elsa. Didn't know how to deal with her feelings
user1: Who was yours?
user2: Me too there could have been more music in the last of the movie.
user2: I liked olaf and Sven
user1: Now I'm wondering if I should rewatch it. It's been a while since I've seen it...
user1: Is that the only movie you got to read about?
user2: I have watched it with my two daughters numerous times
user2: Yes the only one mentioned 
user1: Haha I'm sure you're sick of the music by now
user2: Yes I was quite over it within a month of it being released
user1: Haha
user1: which is your favorite song besides "Let It Go"
user2: Ummm, actually the song in the beginning before they open the gates. I forget the name
user2: Which was yours?
user1: Love Is An Open Door? is that the one?
user1: or maybe it's For the First Time
user2: Yes that's the one
user1: well I've tried hard to like the other songs but I still love Let it Go lol
user2: Me also
user1: and it's one of the few songs I like watching the video for

conversation:
user2: hey, did you like Frozen?
user1: I did - I like animated movies. What did you think?
user2: I liked it! I really enjoyed the singing
user1: Who was your favorite character?
user2: Sven, the reindeer, how about you?
user1: I liked Anna the best.
user2: I enjoy Kristen Bell, I think she's a good actress. 
user1: She was great! But I thought Idina Menzel had the best songs.
user2: I had no idea about their age diffrences
user1: Oh, I didn't know either. But they were both really good in the roles.
user2: I think Elsa should have told Anna about her cryokinetic magic  it would have resolved the whole freezing the kingdom problem
user1: I guess she was scared. Her parents should have helped her learn to use her magic instead of hiding it.
user2: true, i don't think it helped when they died either
user1: Well, no, that kind of made it worse. That part was really sad.
user2: I wish they should more backstory on there family because you don't really know about who raised them and such 
user1: The parents you mean? They just seemed like generic royalty.
user2: like who was ruling before she turned 21? some family member? because i'm pretty sure the parents had to be dead for a while
user2: also Han's was my least favorite characte
user1: Huh, I thought it was soon after they died. I guess they didn't really say. 
user2: did you have a least favorite characer?
user1: I thought Hans was a good character, but a bad person. He was good at being A TOTAL JERK.
user2: right!!!! 
user1: Probably Anna, she was really brave.
user1: Marshmallow was surprisingly scary for a snowman.
user2: totally
user2: did you like the trolls in the movie?
user1: Yes! I'd like to see more of how Hans knew them.
user1: And everyone should listen to their advice more.
user2: that would be really cool, maybe they will make a short film.
user1: Not Hans, Kristoff, I mean.
user1: That would be fun. Did you think Hans would kiss Anna?
user2: I think he would have, if anna didnt't come to rescue her 
user2: so he could become King
user1: Well, I'm glad he failed. Jerk.
user2: i cant belive the dignitaries would believe a Hans, a stranger to the kingdom then there own princess
user1: They wanted to take advantage of the situation, I guess
user2: yes it seems like it
user2: i wonder why Anna doesn't have any magic powers?
user1: I don't think the parents did either. Maybe it was something that happened to Elsa.
user1: Like she met a troll or something.
user2: that makes sense 

conversation:
user2: Heya!
user1: Hi! Have you seen the 2013 movie Frozen?
user2: Aye, it's fantastic! I love the single.
user2: Have you read Andersen's original?
user1: Yes, Frozen has some of the best music. No, I have not read the original.
user2: Neither have I, but I'm quite curious to see what Disney changed.

conversation:
user2: hello
user2: how are you/
user1: Hi.  You should watch Frozen sometime.  It is possibly one of the best animated movies in years.
user2: yes i enjoyed. It was very interesting movie
user1: It has gotten pretty favorable reviews.  89% from Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore gave it an A+.
user2: I must go and watch full movie again
user1: Did you know that it was Disney's 53rd animated feature?
user2: No i did not know
user2: The quality of this animated movie is Good?
user1: And that like a lot of Disney's films, this one is also based on a fairy tale.  In this case Hans Christian Andersen.
user1: Yes, the quality is good.  Though I have not seen it in 3D which I see is an option.
user2: You gave me an interesting knowledge
user2: Must go Tomorrow
user1: Elsa has cryokinetic magic.  That's an interesting magic to have.
user1: There's a scene in the movie where Elsa and her sister Anna are kids and Elsa uses her magic on her.  Unfortunately her parents isolated them both caused both to have developmental issues.
user2: Amazing dear
user1: And like in lots of fairy tales and Disney movies, the parents of course die - this time in a storm at sea.
user2: OK Thankyou
user1: So Elsa grows up insecure about her magical powers.  At 21, she becomes queen but is worried people will find out about her magic. 
user2: Her magic is very interesting
user1: And Elsa and Anna have grown apart.  But when Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa is not happy and lets her magic out.
user2: Oh so sad
user1: Worried she leaves the kingdom in eternal winter and runs away.
user2: oops
user1: Then the real action starts.  Anna leaves the wintery kingdom to try and find her sister.  Meanwhile we discover Hans to be evil.  And of course there is "true love".
user2: so nice
user1: But instead of it being the love between Hans and Anna - which we find to be false - it is instead the love between the sisters.
user2: ok
user1: But lucky for all involved, it's a Disney movie and everything ends happily ever after for the heroes.
user2: So intersting
user1: Thanks for chatting.

conversation:
user1: Hello, have you ever seen the movie Frozen? 
user2: No i have not but I heard it was really good. 
user1: Yes it seems that it was. All the rating for the movie were very high. Rotten tomatoes even gave it an 89%. 
user2: Wow, that is good. What is the actually movie about? 
user1: Well it about a princess who goes on a journey with an icemen, reindeer, and a snowman. Sounds pretty all over the place haha. 
user2: Well thats a lot of random kid stuff. 
user1: Yeah it is but the actors in it are surprisingly good. 
user2: Who was in it? 
user1: Kirsten Bell and Jonathon Groff are the two names i've heard of. 
user2: I haven't heard of Jonathon Groff before but Kirsten Bell is pretty popular. 
user1: Yeah she plays the main character Anna who is the princess i mentioned before. 
user2: Oh okay that makes sense. 
user1: I can't believe came out in 2013 that seems like so long ago.
user2: A full five years now, it seems like it came out more recently. 
user1: I agree! I just saw that apparently the princesses sister has magic powers 
user2: What kind of powers?
user1: I am not sure put apparently they are out of control! I guess that relates to the princess having to be on a journey. 
user2: Do you think its about the princess saving the her sister? 
user1: Yes it probably something along those lines! So do you like animation movies? 
user2: They aren't my favorite, just okay in my opinion. 
user1: They tend to be some of my favorite! I really like comedy animation, I used to watch them all the time growing up. 
user2: I never really got into them so I don't like them too much. 
user1: I think you should go watch this one, the critic's reviews were really good. 
user2: Oh what did they say?
user1: One critic said that is was the best musical from Disney since the Little Mermaid. 
user2: I did not even know it was a musical, that makes me want to see it less. 
user1: What if tI told you it was in 3d? lol 
user1: I*
user2: That is a little bit better, 3d can be exciting. 

conversation:
user1: I recently saw Frozen, which is a comedy/adventure animation.
user2: It has some great music in it.
user1: Yeah it does, I loved the songs.  It was the best animated musical to come out of Disney since The Little Mermaid lyricist Howard Ashman died.
user2: It is based on the fairy tale The Snow Queen.
user1: Yup, that's a story by Hans Christian Andersen.
user2: Kristoff is an iceman accompanied by Sven.
user1: Did you know Kristoff is played by Jonathon Groff?
user2: Yes, did you know that Kristen Bell voices Anna?
user1: Yup, I loved her.  But Katie Lopez played Anna as her 5-year-old self.
user2: I loved Idina Menzel's voice as Elsa.
user1: Me too, she was great.  I think Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the directors, did a great choice casting.
user2: I think it is sad that both sisters were isolated in the castle.
user1: It was.  But ultimately Frozen was a deep film, like a Pixar movie.
user2: It would have been a very different movie if Elsa had mastered instead of suppressed her powers.
user1: Absolutely.  I like that they added the naive snowman pal to the movie.
user2: I love how the troll Grand Pabbie warns Elsa to learn to control her powers.
user1: I wonder why Elsa was scared that the townspeople would find out about her powers.  I thought they were cool.
user2: I would love to have her powers and create my own palace of ice.
user1: Me too, but the Duke branded her a monster because of her powers.  That's awful.
user2: Well the Duke was a schemer.
user1: Yeah he was.  Good thing Prince Hans was there.
user2: I am glad that the coronation happened without a hitch, but Elsa was right to object on the proposal.
user1: Definitely.  Did you see the giant snow creature Marshmallow?  
user2: Yes and Anna's hair turning white was insane.
user1: And then Hans betrayed her!
user2: I cannot believe that the dignitaries believed him.
user1: Thankfully she escaped!
user2: No kidding since Hans had ordered Elsa's execution.
user1: What a great movie!
user2: It was a great movie with the trolls.

conversation:
user2: Hello, I liked this movie a lot for an animated movie
user1: hello me to i think it was nice 
user2: I'm surprised it didn't do even better than 89% on rotten tomatoes. 
user1: a little childish as i am a grown man but it was passible
user2: I'm a grown woman and rewatched this recently
user1: yes me to it should had gotten at least a 95
user2: I have days where that one song from this movie still gets stuck in my head
user1: mm inresting  i like more movies like anime likevfirestar etc. elsa typ movies are not really my type
user2: I'm a big fan of disney movies
user1: what is the name of the song if you know
user2: let it go was the song....now it will be in my head all day
user1: i to like disney movies but think somtimes they are to childish they should make adult movies to
user1: oh yes i remember it!! :)
user1:  i wish i hadevcryokinetic powers
user1: do you?
user2: They have made some good movies. I like idea of her "cryokinetic" powers 
user2: I would use that power all the time if I had it
user1: its nice to have does powers but also imagin if you grab your child and you freez him wthout wanting to. thats scary
user1: you would need to practice alot to really control and master it
user2: yeah I think thats an interesting part of the story because she has trouble controlling her powers 
user1: yes in fact thats why she left the kingdom and is not a princess
user1: until she learns how to control her powers and comes back
user2: I may have to rewatch this movie again. The characters were so well presented
user1: i just saw it one time a long time ago to be exact like2 years ago i might need to watch it again to
user2: I actually forgot about the trolls until I was reading this so it's been too long for me.
user1: what trolls?
user2: in the forest they meet a bunch of little trolls that heal one of the people. I don't remember all the details so I have to watch this again
user1: mmmm i totally forgot about it!!!
user2: To be hones I forgot about a lot of this movie and just remembered the snow creature was named marshmallow 
user1: i love the part where she summonsbthe ice montster to scare alway the elsa
user2: yeah that was a good part
user1: mmm i wonder why they called him Marshmallow

conversation:
user2: Hi 
user1: hello there
user2: how  r u?
user1: doing ok, how about yourself?
user2: good thanks
user2: so which movie is it?
user1: movie is called Frozen
user1: animated film by Disney
user2: nice when did it release?
user2: i mean the year?
user1: it was released in 2013
user2: do you know what is it about?
user1: basically there's these two sisters
user1: one is named Elsa, the other called Anna. Elsa actually has some magical talents
user2: i see
user2: which age group does it cater to?
user1: she injures her sister while they were playing around as children. After this happened the parents took Elsa to visit some trolls
user1: good trolls
user1: heals Anna and warns Elsa to be more careful with the powers
user1: so anyway down the line the parents die at sea during a storm
user1: Elsa turns 21 and supposed to be crowned Queen......bunch of people show up to the castle for the event
user1: Anna's there, falls for this dude named Prince Hans and he ends up proposing
user2: ok ... does the movie has any learnings?
user2: is the movie for kids?
user1: yea I'd say this is for kids, adults can watch as well but mainly for kids
user1: far as learnings, I don't notice any. I think this is primarily entertainment
user2: do u think it is entertaining?
user1: yes I do
user2: these girls were daughters of king/queen?
user1: yes they were both princesses (well until Elsa was crowned Queen)
user2: why Elsa was crowned and not Anna
user2: because of magical powers?
user1: I believe it had to do with age, Elsa was the oldest child
user2: ok
user2: does the movie caters more to girls?
user1: you know what, I would say so
user1: good observation
user2: what genre would you say is it?
user1: combination of comedy, adventure and animation
user2: romcom?
user1: I wouldn't go that far
user2: ok 
user1: all these little movies with princesses always have them connecting with a handsome prince but that isn't really the film's focus
user2: hmm
user2: ok i think i can finish the conversation now ... nice talking to you
user2: bye
user1: ok bye 
user1: thank you

user2: Do you watch them by yourself or with kids?
user1: usually by myself, I dont have kids.
user2: Have you ever heard about the movie called Frozen?  It is also suitable for adults.
user1: I have heard of the movie Frozen, though I have never seen it. It was pretty popular from what I hear.
user2: You should take a look at it.  It is popular for a reason.  
user1: what makes it so good?
user2: Well, the music
user2: For one.  It is very good.   There is a wonderful twist coming down the end.  I would tell you about it, but I would wait for you to see it yourself.
user1: thanks for not spoiling it.
user1: the snowman is in it, correct>
user2: It is available on Netflix.  Do you have Netflix?
user1: I do have netflix
user2: Yes, there is a snowman
user1: yeah you are right, the soundtrack is popular. kids love it.

user2: There is a lot of magic.
user1: i like monsters inc
user1: basically anything with monsters
user2: Hmm.  Do you like princesses?
user1: I don't. I'm worried it might not be in my wheelhouse. 
user1: Up is good too. 
user2: Sometimes, it is good to try new things.
user1: We are in total agreement on that, my friend
user2: It is also a comedy.  Everyone love comedies
user1: I actually had a surgery about 4 years ago, and it's virtually impossible for me to laugh. That is true story,
user2: I am sorry to hear this.

user2: Football is not that popular in my country.  We are more of soccer fans.
user2: We were supposed to be talking about Frozen, but we digressed.
user1: Indeed. I am glad you were real. It means I take your advice on the movie Frozen with more weight now.
user2: Ok.  Well, I will finish this conversation now.  Watch Frozen, but do it with kids.  Even though you can't laugh, seeing their happy faces would make you feel good.  I hope your condition does not cause you pain.  Take care of yourself

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Let's talk!
user2: Hello! How are you?  The movie is called Frozen. Have you seen it? 
user1: Actually No I haven't seen that movie 
user2: It is a 3D computer animated musical disney film - you should see it. It's really good!
user1: That does sound interesting. Is it a Pixar film?
user2: It is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, it is their 53rd featured film. Did you know it is inspired from a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tail?
user1: Oh, right... Which fairy tale is that?
user2: The fairy tale is called "The Snow Queen" - a story about a brave princess who sets out with a group of friends to finder her estranged sister.
user1: That does sound like a good one. Do you know which actors provided voices for the characters?
user2: Yes - Kristen Bell voiced Anna, Idina Menzel voiced Elsa, and Jonathan Groff was Kristoff. It is a starry cast for sure! Do you like these actors?
user1: I like Kristen Bell. She's quite funny and I find her very attractive. She could be the princess in my dreams.
user1: I don't think I know Idina Menzel
user2: haha thats funny! The film has amazing reviews, especially for the music. It has a Rotten Tomatoes 89%, Metacritics 74/100, CinemaScore A+... and thats probably due to Idina Menzel's voice!
user1: I guess the soundtrack is quite popular
user2: It is! one critic said they could envision it as a Broadway musical. Another said it has Broadway-style songs. I would not be surprised if there is a version on Broadway already.
user1: Have you ever seen a Broadway musical?
user1: I think I have heard the title song... did it win any academy awards?
user2: I have not unfortunately, but I would love to see Frozen if it is on Broadway. The story is very complex - comedy, adventure and animation all rolled into a musical. I'm not sure if it won any awards!
user1: Who was your favorite character in the movie?
user2: My favorite character is Anna, she is an adventurer and is dedicated to finding her sister Elsa (who is basically a magical ice princess). She has to find her so that she can release the kingdom from an eternal winter. 
user1: Is there a villain?
user2: Yes! at first it appears Elsa is a villian, but I dont think she is. I think she is just misunderstood and insecure. The real villian is Hans, who Anna falls in love with. Elsa ends up saving Anna from Hans by unleashing her powers
user1: Why he is a bad guy?
user2: I think Elsa knows things about him, I haven't watched the film in a while :) Offhand, I do know Hans's father the Duke of Weselton is angry about her ruining the engagement and banishes her. So Elsa turned the kingdom into an eternal winter
user1: She sounds very crazy
user2: she is, but so is anna! she is friends with an iceman named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven lol 
user1: Which do you think would be the better princess to marry? Elsa or Anna?
user2: hmmm probably Anna, Elsa seems unstable due to her magical powers haha
user1: But magical powers sounds sexy
user1: I wonder what other powers she has
user2: yeah but she turns everything she touches to ice - thats scary :)
user2: and she has no control over it!
user1: haha that is scary
user1: I guess that means no sex

conversation:
user2: So, are you a big fan of animated movies like Frozen?
user1: Yes, I typically love movies of this genre. You?
user2: When I was a kid, sure.  An animated movie has to be really special for me to watch it now.
user1: Do you generally watch animated movies that have good ratings like this one?
user2: Yes, because the critical response and overall ratings were really strong.  So it was more out of curiosity more than anything else?
user2: Scrap the question mark at the end of that.
user1: I am a little over princess movies, but since this was about sisters, it was more compelling to me.
user1: Who was your favorite voice cast?
user2: I'm a fan of Kristen Bell.  I enjoyed her other work.  You?
user1: I don't recognize the names of the people who played the 5 year old version of Anna but thoguht that Kristen Bell did a great job as well.
user2: What did you think about Idina Menzel?
user1: Did a great job! 
user2: I thought she did well too
user2: But it was sad when their parents died.
user1: It was so sad for a childrens animated movie. You don't typically see that in the plot line.
user2: But I guess it does bring a little of realism that not everything in a fairy tale is happy.
user1: Very true. I liked that it showed family conflict and issues - such as when the King and Queen isolated the sisters.
user1: So dramatic the plots between the Duke and prince and the sisters.
user2: Yes they are.  The ice palace that Elsa created was pretty cool though.
user1: Sounds so cold. 
user2: I'm sure it was
user1: I wonder who ruled the kingdom for hte time between when parents died and elsa turned 21!
user2: That's a really good question.  But then again, it's a kids movie and they don't worry about power vacuums!
user1: i love that the ice creatures name is marshmellow
user2: Haha.  It's a character worth rooting for purely because of the name.
user2: Unlike Hans
user1: Hans is the evil prince! 
user1: Lucky for them all the queen escaped.
user2: I wonder how she escaped
user1: froze everything?
user1: haha
user2: I would certainly make sense
user1: turn her weakness into a strength
user2: Sure, and that is a really important lesson to learn
user2: Time to finish the conversation

conversation:
user1: Hi. How are you today?
user2: Hey I'm great, how are you doing today?
user1: Just fine. Hey, I watched a movie a while back and it popper into my head. Frozen.
user2: Frozen is a good movie, did you enjoy it?
user1: I did. I remember seeing it in the Theatres back in 2013.
user2: I saw it earlier this month for the first time, whos your favorite characteR?
user1: I actually really enjoyed Kristoff. How about you?
user2: Elsa because my daughter loved her!
user1: lol. My kids loved that movie. I wanted to watch is because of the actresses who voices Anna and Elsa. 
user2: Exactly thats why I went as well, do you know if they're making a sequel?
user1: I heard they might make one, but I don't know for sure. The Frozen short film they made didn't go over well with audiences.
user2: I didnt see that, how was it?
user1: I didn't see it either, just heard it was "20 minutes I'll never get back."
user2: Oh that sounds awful hopefully my daughter doesn't want to go, we should all go to the sequel sometime.
user1: I agree. When it comes out. That should be fun. Do you think they'll keep the same cast?
user2: I think they'll change some of it up just to keep it fresh but keep the main characters, what about you?
user1: I agree. Keep the main cast and they'll be fine. 
user2: What was your favorite part about the movie?
user1: The reindeer. lol
user2: Absolutely agreed.
user1: Did you know the guy who played Kristoff was actually a famous broadway singer?
user2: I had no idea but that makes sense, hes got the voice for sure, know any other cool factS?
user1: A few. The movie was based off of a Hans Christian Andersen story called "the snow queen".
user2: Im gonna tell my daughter about all these, I'll have to check out the book.
user1: I think it's a short story. Maybe you should read it first. A lot of his stories don't have happy endings.
user2: I will have to to make sure theres nothing too bad, it was a great movie thats for sure
user1: I agree. Wonderful movie.
user1: What was your favorite song in the movie?
user2: Definitely "let it go", you?
user1: I guess I'm the odd ball. the song kristoff sang to the reindeer.

user1: Have you left to immediately go watch the film FROZEN?
user1: RAM - I have not heard back from you for 5 minutes. 
user1: Anna too had a situation where her sister, Elsa, would not communicate with her. Having locked herself in a room to prevent unintended disaster, Elsa cursed herself to a life of solitude. You see, Elsa had magical powers in which she could harness the power of snow/ice. 
user1: As time would show; however, Elsa would let go of her isolation and embrace who she was. 
user1: I would suggest this movie to all!

user1: yeah me too
user2: I'm not sure if it is possible to have a part 2 of that movie.
user1: they had 2 short stories frozen fever and christmas themed .. wishing if there would be some crossovers
user2: Frozen is based from a novel entitled The Snow Queen.
user1: yes but they pretty much succeeded in changing the tradition of prince saving the princess.. so may be a spin off original plot
user2: Yeah, I agree with you.
user2: how many times did you watch the movie?
user1: may be some 3-4 times 
user2: Really. I watched it more than 8 times but I never get bored even though I watched it many times.

conversation:
user2: Hello, what did you think of Frozen?
user1: It sounds very good, but I've never seen it.
user2: Well, task says you're supposed to imagine you've seen it.
user1: True. I will say I liked it, since I generally like Disney films. Did you like it?
user2: It was pretty good.  Definitely fun for younger kids, but I like Disney movies.  What did you think of Elsa?
user1: I really like Idina Menzel's voice, so I liked Elsa.
user2: Interesting.  As far as actors, I'm not too fond of Kristen Bell, so wasn't really into Princess of Arendelle.
user1: I can understand that. Did you think the songs were Broadway quality, like one of the critics said?
user2: Yes, and like another one said, you could definitely see it becoming a Broadway musical....but I'd prefer the cartoon movie.
user1: Sometimes Broadway productions can be a bit too flashy for my taste, so I can understand that.
user2: So, did you find it "emotionally gripping" like others said, or were you just entertained?
user1: I have sisters so I can sort of identify with the idea of reuniting with a sister who has become estranged - in that way I suppose yes. How about you?
user2: I don't get too caught up in that stuff.  I like the "jokey middle" as one critic put it, far better, that's more my style.
user1: Disney films definitely need jokes and fun bits, all of the good ones have them. Perhaps that critic doesn't normally like Disney movies. Do you think that Frozen showed that Disney was still relevant like the final critic put it?
user2: Yeah, in a way.  It wasn't nearly as good as some of their past movies, like "Beauty and the Beast".  That one had hilarity throughout.  I mean, every Disney movie has some kind of moral of the story, but generally I watch them for the laughs that most people don't get.
user1: Do you think it might have been better if it was done in traditional animation rather than computer animation? I usually prefer traditional animation, and I think it's more conducive to those little visual jokes, like the ones in the Little Mermaid in Ariel's collection of things that people use and such.
user2: Yes, absolutely.  I think Disney knows who they are, but someone new always comes along and wants to "upgrade" things that don't need to be upgraded all the time.  Still, some of their more modern stuff is pretty good, and like you said, allows for some of the fun and hijinks.  What part was your favorite?  The beginning, the end, somewhere in between?
user1: Probably the jokey middle, like you. I like to have fun with my children's movies. Do you think that one of the director's being a woman contributed positively to the outcome, since the movie has such a focus on female characters, or do you think it doesn't really matter?
user2: Great question.  I mean, it was focused on a female lead her sister, it might be conducive to have a female directing it as she would know what it's like to be a girl...but, have to say, some male directors do a pretty good job of figuring them out, as well.  I think it really didn't matter, to be honest.  What about you?
user1: I think that with a company like Disney there's so much input from so many talented people that it probably didn't make a difference. If it had been more of someone's personal passion type of movie it would be more likely to matter. 
user2: True.  I think one of the messages in the movie wouldn't matter in regards to gender.  What I noticed in the movie is what we can see a lot in real life.  Elsa has these powers that she keeps hidden, (like someone with a talent), but in front of the King, she accidentally reveals those powers and everyone trashes on her to the point that she hides away in some mountaintop to be by herself for the rest of her life.  There's definitely a link to how some people in life are treated due to their abilities, as well.  Did you get that, or did you get a different message?
user1: I definitely agree that the movie sends a strong message that it's wrong to judge people by how they are through no fault of their own, but also that isolating yourself is very unhealthy, like how Elsa running away instead of dealing with her powers causes eternal winter in Arendelle.
user1: Do you think that Hans secretly being evil was a good twist, or do you think that people would have expected it before it happened?
user2: In a way, it could be expected as there always has to be a villan.  And it prompted Elsa to accidentally reveal her powers...but, the good part about all of that is, the evil did not win again, because the threat of her sister being frozen forever got Elsa to reverse the spell.  So, as always, people like Hans never win.
user1: That is probably the best message of all - that scheming and villainy don't pay off. Some people say that good vs. evil type plots are too black and white morally, but I think that sometimes you just need something that's fundamentally simple, especially for a children's movie. What do you think?
user2: Absolutely.  It's in a lot of Disney movies, too.  You have a couple of characters who have had a nice, happy, peaceful life, something happens (in this case she injured her sister and then their parents died), but they kind of recover, then they are met by evil, and they manage to overpower it because of their bond - there's so many messages in this movie, that's it great for little kids to see.  I think they might be learning while not realizing it.  Do you think that's possible, or do they need to be older to understand what's going on?
user1: Kids are like sponges for learning, really. I think they do learn without knowing it a lot, and like you said, there are a lot of good messages that they'll internalize, like the power that comes from working together. Older kids probably get something different from the movie, just because they can understand nuance a little better, but even little kids benefit from good moral messages in media.
user2: I agree.  There's a lot of them in this movie.  Evil plots never win, love is stronger than evil, as you said, working together creates positive outcomes, and when you do all of that, you can have your "happily ever after" ending.  I was going to ask you, but you kind of hit on it, what you think adults get from it....
user1: I think adults get good moral message as well, while understanding the nuances much better than kids. It looks like the task is done, but it's been fun talking. Cheers!

user1: It was definitely funny, especially the parts with the snowman.
user2: 3D movie vey nice

user2: Yes defenetely
user1: I enjoyed the parts with the trolls.
user2: It is a box office movie
user1: The part where the parents die was sad.
user2: Love is an open door song very nice
user1: Yes it is.
user1: I loved Elsa's ice palace.
user2: I am also love so much 
user1: I'm surprised different voice actors voiced the sisters at different ages. I thought Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel voiced them all the way through.
user2: Frozen" is the world's 10th-highest-grossing film of all time.
user1: That doesn't surprise me. It was very popular.
user2: Yes it a true word
user1: The part where Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart is also sad.
user2: Yes i think so
user1: Did you think that Marshmallow was scary?
user2: Yes i know
user1: And Hans turned out to be a villain.
user2: Yes i think so 
user1: He left Anna to die.
user2: Yes it is a really sad situation
user1: Yes. Do you have a favorite character from Frozen?
user2: Yes i have a favourite character
user1: Who is your favorite character?
user2: Elsa
user1: I like Elsa too!
user2: I am big fan 
user1: What did you think of Sven the reindeer?
user2: Acting are awesome
user1: I agree. It was nice talking to you!

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: hello
user2: So what movie do we talk about today?
user1: We will be talking about Frozen.
user1: who do you like best from the voice cast?
user2: well i don't know much about voice cast, so i will pass
user1: what do you find most interesting about this article in regards to the movie?
user2: I just like animation movies sometimes and this falls into the category
user1: Same here I really like that this movie is an american 3D computer- animated musical fantasy film.
user1: The ratings on rotten tomatoes was pretty good.
user2: Moreover I seem to have good history with adventure movies
user2: yeah real good from rotten tomatoes
user2: have you heard of "cryokinetic" before now? 
user1: Im sure this movie will become a musical broadway .
user1: no I have not
user2: Maybe if i see the movie I might get to know 
user1: Based on the key scene it looks like its pretty good.
user2: It must have been a difficult decision from the parents to have chosen to isolate two sisters 
user1: It must have. but if it kept them both safe i guess it was a good choice.
user1: It must have been hard for Queen Elsa to live in fear all the time.
user2: Probably the isolated sister might have been able to help the parents in the storm that killed them
user1: Good point Im sure she could have done something.
user2: Yeah really, for her to be a scape goat for her powers
user1: I dont blame her for running away. 
user1: Especially after she was isolated for so long.
user2: I read that the movie actually projected Disney to higher pinnacles after such a long time since movies like "the little mermaid" and "beauty and the beast"
user2: Oh wait a minute!, it seems the kingdom never knew Elsa possessed such powers?
user1: Yea they didnt know but she was afraid they would find out.
user1: it seems like Elsa had a pretty rough life. Seems like everytime she tried she made things worse.
user2: Pathetic for her for being branded a monster
user1: Well Hans seemed to be a real jerk.
user2: I guess they never understood her
user2: the worst of all and maybe cocky Jerk would be better 
user1: Disney always seems to solve everything with a true loves kiss or love.
user1: I agree hes a cocky Jerk.
user2: Imagine the feeling of rejection

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hi
user1: Have you seen the movie Frozen?
user2: Sure have! It is based on "The Snow Queen"
user1: It is! I loved that it was an animated musical.
user2: Yes, you can practically see the broadway show it is destined to become.
user1: That's true. I really liked the main character because of her attitude.
user2: Who played her?
user1: Kristen Bell
user1: Idina Menzel had a great solo.
user2: There were some others who played her as different ages. Yes, I agree, Elisa is one of my favorite characters in the ovie.
user1: She has such a great singing voice.
user2: I really like the scene where Elsa accidentally injures Anna with magic.
user1: Me too!
user1: I thought the movie definitely deserved the high reviews that it received.
user2: It is sad that their parents die though.
user2: I agree!
user2: Cryokinetic magic is dangerous.
user1: It really is.
user1: I thought it was a different twist on other Disney movies with a fearless princess.
user2: Yes, it shows some cultural relevance.
user2: Elsa should have mastered her magic instead of surpressing it.
user2: *Suppressing  
user1: Absolutely.
user1: Even though it lagged a little bit there were still so many great parts.
user2: Yes, the middle was a bit lagged.
user2: Despite that, Rotten Tomatoes still gave it an 89%.
user1: An CinemaScore gave it an A+
user1: *And
user1: Pretty impressive.
user2: Metacritics was not as nice with only a 74/100
user1: Yeah, that was definitely a lower score.
user2: Marshmallow would make me run too!

conversation:
user1: Hello, I'd like to talk to you about Disney's Frozen
user2: Sure. What did you think of it?
user1: I thought it was the best animated musical to come out of Disney since The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast
user2: Did you like the music best?
user1: Sure. You can practically see that the Broadway musical is destined to come!
user2: That would definitely be interesting, but it seems like the great visuals would be lost.
user1: Of course not! The script really delivers, it's a snowy pleasure
user2: The plot was definitely well done. I found there were some interesteding twists, didn’t you?
user1: Yes, I did! And could you believe that it was the 53rd Disney animated feature?? 
user2: I know. They seem to get better each year. I think this one really reached out to both young and old audiences.
user1: Do you generally watch movies with good ratings? What do you think of the 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? 
user2: I don’t pay too much attention to ratings, but I find most Disney movies to be instant hits with families. This one seemed to be a classic from the start.
user1: The voice performance of Idina Menzel was spectacular! Don't you think?
user2: Yes, she has a powerful voice and the song was a break out hit. I was definitely surprised with that character’s role in the film, though.
user1: I did not like the scene with the the colony of trolls. I thought it didn't fit the plot well at all!
user2: True. I also felt the snowman was a little weird, but he was cute.
user1: Do you typically like movies of the comedy/animation genre?
user2: I do, but I’m also a fan of musicals, which makes Disney movies a win-win.
user1: Nice! Did you know that Jonathan Groff played Kristoff? 
user2: Yes. I thought he did a good job. I also really liked the reindeer.
user1: A movie like this, really grips you emotionally, don't you think?
user2: It does have a very different message than other Disney movies, It’s easy to empathize with the characters.
user1: My favorite scene was when Anna and Kristoff reach Elsa's snow castle because it showed the pure beauty that could have been made from Elsa's magic!
user2: Yes, that was some amazing animation. The action there toward the end was really exiting, too.
user1: And of course Kristen Bell as Anna.... AMAZING! 
user2: I was not expecting here character to be so strong. I also didn’t expect their relationship to be the way it was.
user1: I think that the animation was another strong suit of this picture. 
user2: Yes, it was a very pretty film. The scenery and colors really popped.

conversation:
user1: I really liked Idina Menzel as Elsa, her voice was so powerful in the movie
user2: I agree, she was amazing.
user1: I can't believe that the film was based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale.   I didn't know that.
user2: Yes, it's based on "The Snow Queen." I had read that before.
user1: I loved Anna's fearlessness throughout the movie.  She was a great female lead character!
user2: Yes, she was. I didn't realize three different children played young Anna.
user1: I didn't realize that either, thanks for pointing that out!
user2: How do we get the next document?
user1: What did you think about the crafty plot?
user1: It said it would load automatically
user2: Okay, it's just that it said we only had to have 3 replies per document, and we do.
user2: This looks like a new document. I'm surprised the Rotten Tomatoes score isn't higher than 89%
user1: Me too!  Especially when the Cinema Score is an A+ 
user1: DId you like the part where we met the colony of trolls?
user2: I'm not sure I knew Kristen Bell was Anna. Idina got all the attention.
user1: Yes, she certainly did!  
user1: I didnt know that it was in 3D.  I only saw it in 2D
user2: I don't remember the colony of trolls.
user2: Document 3?
user1: Yes
user2: I can't believe it's been 4 years since it came out.
user1: I was surprised when Elsa's magic engulfed the whole kingdom.  
user1: I can't believe it either, it is still so popular now
user2: I didn't see it in 3D either, wish I had.
user1: I really liked Olaf's character
user1: And the music was amazing!
user2: Me, too. 
user2: Yes, the music was great.
user1: I liked the humor throughout as well
user2: I didn't remember their parents dying at sea.
user1: They did a great job of making the death subtle, which was good for all of the small children watching
user2: Yes, I'm glad it's part comedy.
user1: ME too , overall a great movie!
user2: Yes, it is.
user2: I've never heard of Metacritics or CinemaScore.
user1: Me either, so I do not know how reliable they are.
user2: Yes, one is an A+ and the other is the equivalent of a C
user1: Yea, that is a huge gap!
user2: You had mentioned colony of trolls. I don't remember that scene at all.
user1: Yea, it's the little hairy guys that cure elas's magic issue when she is younger
user2: They were led by Grand Pabbie?
user1: Yes, they were.  
user1: I think we are done with the task now
user2: Okay, do we get a completion code? I think we should wait for one.
user2: Will we get a survey code?

conversation:
user2: Hello!
user2: Sup!
user2: Do you wanna build a snowman
user1: hello! The actor for Anna is Kristen Bell
user2: That is correct!
user1: And Indina Mendel plays Elsa
user2: That is also correct!
user1: I really like that Walt Disney was inspired by the previous fairy tale the snow queen
user2: Did you know that Frozen is the best animated musical to come out of disney according to critics
user1: I did not know that
user2: It's impressive that Eva Bella plays an 8 year old Elsa
user1: I really enjoy that the fearless princess sets off to find her sister
user1: I know!
user2: It's sad that the king and queen isolate the sisters in the castle though
user1: How cool would it be if they made a broadway musical out of the movie
user2: It would be so cool, because the songs are very nice since it's the best animated musical from disney
user1: Yeah the same guy that worked on little mermaid worked on frozen
user1: And the little mermaid is my favorite movie
user2: That's not true, he died before this movie came out
user1: I think it’s sad that she got so scared to be crowned queen
user1: I think it’s also pretty funny that Anna immediately falls in love with the first guy she meets
user2: Yeah that's sad, and it is funny that Anna falls in love
user1: Are you still there

conversation:
user1: Hello?
user2: Hi
user1: What movie are you reading about over there? :)
user2: Have you seen Frozen movie?
user1: Nope.
user1: What's it about?
user2: Its a computer animated musical movie
user1: What are they doing?
user2: The movie is inspired by the fairy tale - The Snow Queen
user1: I've never read the fairy tale before.
user1: Is the Snow Queen evil?
user2: Th story revolves around a fearless princes's search for her estranged sister
user1: Ohh.
user2: and how a rugged iceman, his pet reindeer and naive snowman help her out
user1: Sounds kinda cute.
user2: The movie's genre is comedy, adventure
user2: I feel its really worth watching it
user1: Yeah, it sounds cool.
user1: #puns
user2: Do u wish to know more about story?
user1: I asked if the Snow Queen was evil. Or who is she?
user2: Yes
user1: What else?
user2: The two sisters in the plot were Elsa and Anna
user1: Are they really close in the movie?
user2: Elsa happens to accidentally injure Anna while they both were playing in the childhood
user2: She injured her with her magical powers
user1: What powers?
user2: cryokinetic magic
user1: Does Anna have powers as well?
user2: Then their parents took both of them to a colony led by Grand Pabbie where he heals Anna
user2: Nope
user2: But while healing, he removes her memories about Elsa's powers
user1: Is there a reason why?
user2: So that Anna doesn't know that her sister had harmed her probably
user1: Oh
user2: king and queen isolate both of them for their safety within the castle
user2: while both become teens, their parents die during a storm
user1: That's sad.
user2: Now when Elsa turns 21, she was going to be crowned as queen
user2: but she had a fear in her mind
user1: About her sister?
user2: that people might find out about her powers
user1: Ohh.
user1: I figured she would just tell people about them later, when she's older or trained.
user2: The castle opens up for coronation ceremony wherein Duke and a prince from Southern Isles comes to attend the ceremony
user1: Are they nice?
user2: Prince Hans and Anna fall in love and Hans proposes to Anna
user2: Yea
user1: Oooh.
user2: But Elsa objects to this and shows her powers
user1: She gets intro trouble, right?
user2: Looking at her powers, Duke brands her as monster
user2: Nope
user2: She flees but she has engulfed the kingdom in an eternal winter
user1: Are they trapped inside?
user2: Whereas she herself discards her crown and reaches North Mountain to create a palace of ice to live for her
user2: No
user1: Like the Fortress of Solitude.
user2: Anna reaches out to Elsa and then lets her know what she has done to the kingdom
user2: Instead of repenting, she  freezes Anna's heart
user1: Wow.
user2: Now the Kristooff from Elsa's kingdom takes her to  meet Grand Pabbie
user1: To look for a cure?
user2: who says to cure Anna a ture act of love could help 
user2: *true
user2: yea
user2: So he races her back to hans
user2: Anna is with Hans
user2: but rather than kissing her, he defeats Elsa's snow creature Marshmallow
user1: What's Marshmallow?
user2: and reveals that he had been plotting to sieze Elsa's kingdom
user2: A giant snow creature
user2: So Hans locks Anna in a room to die and lets everyone know that Elsa killed Anna
user2: And orders for Elsa's execution
user1: Woah.
user2: But somehow Elsa manages to escape the cell
user2: Doesn't it sounds adventurous
user2: ?
user1: Yeah, it does.
user2: While critics have said that bit more could have been done to have a better conclusion 
user2: but nevertheless its a complete entertainment as it has comedy, adventure
user1: Sounds like.
user2: SO would u be reading the fairy tale or directly watching the movie?
user1: I could do both. 
user2: ohh nice
user2: okay then I feel we are good
user2: Do u want to know anything else?
user1: Nope. Thanks, though.
user2: ur welcome
user2: Okay Then we end the conversation
user2: Bye
user1: See ya.

conversation:
user1: I didn't realize that Disney had made 53 animated feature films by 2013. Frozen is a testament to their ability  to make movies.
user2: Yes, I agree. I also didn't realize that it was based on fairy tale "The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersent. I thought that Disney wrote the script from scratch. But they did a good job turning it into a nice princess tale.
user2: What was your favorite character in the movie?
user1: I am going to have to say Elsa. How about you?
user2: Ah, that is a good one. I loved a iceman Olaf. 
user1: the best animated musical since the little mermaid and beauty and the beast. These movies came out when I was a child...it took some 30 year to get another good one.
user1: good talent is hard to find.
user2: Yes, I agree. Broadway style songs in the movie are just fantastic and memorable. 
user1: I would think that the Disney worked so long so to get it so right; the songs, the scripts. 
user2: I can't agree with you more. The great script and songs attracted not only kids, but also adults. It was such a fan family movie.
user2: The movie started with the sad story. Their parents had sad sudden death
user1: Now i have to do some reserach on Howard Ashman. It is amazing that one person had such a penetrating effect.
user2: Huh. I don't know who that it. Is he one of the producer of this movie?
user1: howard Ashman was the lyricist for the little mermaid and Beauty an the Beast
user1: Disney movies seem to start with a tragic loss.
user2: Did he write some songs in Frozen too?
user1: I don't think so.
user1: the doc said frrozen was the best animated musical since his death
user1: What is Metacritics? 74/100; that is a low score for such a influential
user1: ... for such an influential movie
user2: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I love songs in Little Mermaid and Beauty and Beast. It is good to know who wrote those lyrics. 
user2: I am not sure. Meta means multiple, isn't it? It is critics from multiple movie professionals?
user1: the story about sibling rivalry would also resonate with alot of people
user1: that makes sense. about the meta-multiple thing
user2: Yes, I agree. The story line of this movie is focusing how siblings had conflicts and developed their trust and love. Many people have similar stories with their siblings
user2: It is interesting to see that "true love" of this movie is love between siblings.
user1: Plot twist with key scene no 3. expect the unexpected.
user1: I like that the movie took the focus off romantic love fo the most part. let's hear it for family love! that will get us through the rough spots in llife
user2: Yes, romantic partners are not always someones who take you up. Family bond is sometimes just what we need.
user1: definitely an engaging enough platform to send that type of message, indeed.
user2: Also, it is a good way for kids to learn that they don't want to decide to get married based on love at the first sight like Anna and Hans.
user1: thank you. people do put more effort into buying a car than a marriage mate! so this is a good message
user1: correction** picking a marriage mate
user2: Huh? It still doesn't make much sense. But it is a good message!
user1: lol. i guess it doesn't.people can't wait another great Disney movie that has the same power as Frozen.
user2: Yes, including me! 
user2: This movie is classified with Comedy, Adventure, Animation. What did you think about Comedy part of this movie?
user1: wow, it has been awhile. but i do have to say that disney has been able to do cloaked jokes that adults will laughed at while the kids may or may not get right off the bat.
user1: they are trying to appeal to adults without losing the kid-audience
user2: Oh, that is good to hear, but I cannot remember their cloaked jokes. Do you have any examples? All jokes or laugh parts of this movie that I can think of are Olaf does cute/funny actions and singing/dancing.
user1: right of the bat, I can't say.  But I do love goofy jokes and antic myself. so Olaf would be guy.
user2: Oh yeah, I completely forgot, but this movie is also about romantic love between Kristoff and Anna!
user1: well, we couldn't avoid that romantic love. that the stuff of life.
user2: Yes, it is.
user2: Okay, we have talked for 40 min. I think that we had a good conversation
user2: It was nice talking with you!
user1: let me count we need 15 passes
user1: i got 15.
user2: Me too.
user2: Do you think that we are good?
user1: okie doke i enjoyed it too
user1: clicking finish conversation now
user2: Okay, I do that
user2: Have a good night!
user1: you too :)

conversation:
user1: So have you seen the movie Frozen?
user2: Yes I enjoued it very much
user1: What was your favorite part?
user2: It is inspired by the tale “snow queen”
user1: Yes. Elsa was pretty amazing in it.
user1: Did you know she is 21 at the time of when she was fully grown?
user2: Do you know who made the voice cast of kristof
user1: Jonathan Groff. He did a great job as he was my favorite character. 
user1: Did you know there is a Broadway musical about frozen?
user2: Wow amazingdid you know that there were two different people voice casting Anna in her different ages
user2: No That is my first tome to know about that
user1: I did, as it was livvy stubenbrach and Katie lopez when she was 5
user2: Exactly
user1: Kristen bell did it when she was grown
user1: I'm shocked Metacritics only gave it a score of 74/100 but rotten tomatoes 89%
user2: Yes that was a surprise for me
user2: I would rate it 95% how about you?
user1: I would give it the same.
user1: Key scene that did it for me is when Elsa accidently displays her powers
user1: Duke deems her a monster, when he shouldn't
user2: Yes that was a bad part for me , made me so emotional 
user1: It was a route part, but she gets to build her own ice palace
user2: The critics said it has the best animated musical since the death of howard
user1: Yep it just plain terrific family entertainment
user2: It aas a great sacrifice when she discarded her crown and feed
user2: Fleed 
user1: Yep, she was trying to protect her sister, and accidently freezes her heart afterall 
user2: Do tou generally check the rating of the movie before watching it?
user1: Yes. Rotten Tomatoes is usually my go too.
user2: Same as me
user1: Also I couldn't believe how bad Hans turned out to be and wanted dethrone the sisters
user2: Yes ,his real character was a chock for me

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello, have you ever seen Frozen?
user1: Yes, I have
user1: My kids love this movie
user2: Kristen Bell did an amazing job as Anna.
user1: Yes she did.
user2: i didnt realize that Livvy Stubenrauch was the voice of 5 year old Anna.
user1: What did you think of the Elsa charactore
user1: I did not know that!
user2: Elsa was great, Frozen was the biggest success Disney has had since the death of Howard Ashman.
user2: He did Little Mermaid and Beuty and the beast
user1: I figured it made a huge amount of money from it.  The fact that the craze has lasted for several years shows it success.
user1: I loved both of those movies.
user2: You know its now a Broadway play?
user1: No I did not realize that
user2: It will be a big part of Disneys modern legacy.
user1: It probably rank up there with the Lion King on Broadway
user2: I think its just terrific family entertainment.
user1: Yes it is.  I like that it shows how to reconnect as a family 
user2: Did you think the story lagged on its way to conclusion?
user1: At time I think it did.  I think the whole Olaf summer song was simply filler and could have been left out or replaced with a different scene.
user2: Those songs are definetly in the style of Broadway, I rather liked them.
user1: This is only song in the entire movie that I just didn't love.
user2: I think it was a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance.
user2: I loved the trolls who healed Anna.
user1: Yes I think they could add more of them in 
user2: was sad to watch Elsa be so fearful of her powers.
user2: Her fear of the Citizens rejecting her for being different is relatable to a lot of people.
user1: It is. I do wish they had portrayed as more accepting of her powers and embracing her uniqueness.    
user1: It is very relatable.  
user2: Yes, I agree.
user2: I was so shocked When Elsa freezes Anna's heart!

user2: Like are you supposed to learn something from the story?
user1: it a walt disney movies
user2: Ok. I like Walt Disney.  Does anyone die? 
user1: no.
user2: That's good. I hate how when I was growing up, someone normally died in a Walt Disney movie. 
user1: she summons a giant snow creature
user2: Oh wow so it's about witchcraft? 
user1: yes
user1: magic
user2: Hmm. Is there a wizard in the movie? 
user1: let see
user1: no
user2: Do you think my five year old can watch it or would it be to scary with the magic?
user1: it seen the same people produce the little mermaid 
user2: Oh. I remember that being scary when I saw it in the theater when I was little. 
user1: yes.
user1: do remember beauty and the beast
user2: I do. I just watched that netflix movie with real people a few weeks ago.
user1: yes. they produce that movies as well
user1: make
user2: Ok. Thanks for all the information!
user1: you can't see the information on the left?
user2: No. 
user1: wow
user2: Have a good day. 
user1: they say this is the 53 disney movies
user1: they make frozen cup and puzzler. 
user1: at the store.

conversation:
user1: Did you enjoy the movie Frozen?
user2: Believe it or not, I've actually never sat through it! My daughter has watched it a few times with me in the room but I have never taken the time to sit and enjoy it. Did you enjoy it?
user1: Yes, I watched with with my daughter and I think I really enjoyed just watching her enjoy it.
user1: Did your daughter tell you what the movie was about?
user2: I really should sit and watch it. I feel like I've missed something by not seeing it. Yes she has told me what it's about. I don't remember too much but I think it's a cute story. Have you ever heard of the original Hans Christian Andersen story?
user1: they save their country from a bitter cold season - which we all can relate to.
user2: Yes, we can relate. I didn't realize the lyricist, Howard Ashman died. 
user1: Wow I didn't know that either.  The songs became very familiar to little people singing them all over the place.  
user2: Yeah, I couldn't get away from it! Haha! I like how the female characters are strong. That's a good thing for our daughters to see.
user1: Elsa was kind of like the villian but she was just confused which many little people can be.
user1: I love a disney movie with a lesson learned
user1: so strategies is the next topic - The movie was rated high 
user2: Me too! I learned so many lessons from Disney as a kid!
user1: Do you generally watch movies with good or bad ratings?
user2: Yes it was rated high. It had a lot of hype as most Disney movies do. I have weird taste so I don't look at rating but more at subject matter.
user1: Interesting - I guess sometimes the movie critics are not always right.
user1: I wonder how you could see Frozen today since you haven't seen it yet.  I wonder if Netflix has it.
user2: It just depends on personal taste I guess. I generally love the Disney animated movies though. I wish I watched Frozen so I could be in the loop!
user2: It is probably on there, I have to check. If not, I can probably rent it
user2: My daughter would be thrilled to have me watch it with her
user1: I am not much of a dvd renter - I am totally into netflix and movies like Frozen.
user1: Mine too - she would love to watch it again.
user1: looks like we have to continue to talk about the theme
user2: I rarely rent because I'm cheap so If Frozen is on Netflix or other streaming services I am on, then I'll definitely watch. If not, I tend to procrastinate!
user2: I like Kristin Bell, shes
user2: she's funny
user2: I didn't realize it was 3D
user1: Yes.  Looks like the document changed and we need to talk about more info.  I didn't realize it was 3D either. But I am not much of a 3D person - 
user2: Neither am I
user1: I took my son (3years old) to one and he took his glasses off the whole time.
user2: haha that's something I would do!
user1: Wow the doc shows that the singers were actually young girls
user1: To be that young and to be that talented.
user2: yeah, I can't imagine how much determination they needed to have! Very talented!
user2: I didn't realize there were trolls in the movie
user1: sometimes putting a young person under that type of pressure is not a good thing
user2: I absolutely agree
user1: I actually don't remember trolls
user2: I guess they are Kristoff's adoptive family?
user1: Probably.  The character that stands out besides the girls is the snowman (Olfie) or something like that. You see the snowman figure everywhere
user2: I think it's funny to name a giant snow creature "marshmallow"!
user2: Yeah I've seen him before
user1: He was the comic in the film with a bunch of line liners
user1: one liners
user2: His character seemed really cute
user2: It's crazy it came out in 2013!
user2: seems like last year!
user1: I know - it seems like yesterday
user1: 5 years ago 
user2: Tme flies
user1: Indeed
user2: Reading all this info on the movie makes me want to see it more that ever. Such a sweet sounding story.
user1: So in the end their kingdom survives - we love happy endings.
user2: Thank goodness. You never know with Disney films. Theres always a lesson to be learned though.
user2: I had never heard of Idina Menzel before. She does the voice of Elsa
user1: I didn't know who they were either.  Yes, years pass and you can always count of Disney.  
user1: cartoon characters and real people's voices don't mix
user1: Unless they have a very distinct voice
user2: Very true
user1: I always remember the funny characters like Olaf and there was a funny moose or reindeer in the the film too.
user2: I didn't realize Disney had had only 53 animated features at this point! Seems like they had so much more!
user1: Seriously - that seems low.  I wonder if Disney world as a Frozen section
user2: I love the animal characters. Disney does really well with those. You could tell they were a big hit in this movei.
user2: I have no idea. Probably.
user1: Well thank goodness we have Disney films like Frozen in the this high tech world of craziness.
user2: I agree. 
user2: I wonder if the movie closely follows the original story?
user1: Not sure - would have to google that one.  All those kids who play their parts in Frozen are probably adults or close to it and are set for life - Frozen will live on and on.
user2: That
user2: that is true
user1: based on the classic 1844 Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Snow Queen
user1: Dang that an old fairytale
user2: Well the story has endured. They don't write stories and fairytales like that anymore!
user1: I bet Disney made the screen play softer than The Snow Queen
user2: most definitely. It's always like that with Disney. They make it sweeter for the kids
user1: Sometimes these fairy tales and movies can be scary for kids. 
user2: I wonder if Arendele is a real place?
user2: I agree
user1: Probably fictional 
user2: How do we finish this conversation? does it close on it's own?
user1: Not a clue
user2: yes most likely. With aspects of reality
user2: me neither
user1: looks like a finish tab to the right. 
user1: shall we hit it
user2: I'll hit it. Nice talking to you!
user1: later

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hey there!
user1: So... have you seen Frozen as well?
user2: Yes!
user1: What did you think?  Not bad, right?
user2: I think most people have
user2: I feel like more adults have seen it compared to kids lol
user1: Yeah, everyone I know has seen it.  Mostly parents, of course!
user2: It was played every day in my house so I know all the songs
user1: I'm always surprised by how many adults love it so much.  But the songs are pretty good.
user1: How about "In Summer"?  Love that one.
user2: I like them all!
user2: I like that it empowers women
user2: Or...It's woman based
user2: or girl
user1: Yeah, the relationship between the sisters is clearly the centerpiece.  It's nice to see.
user1: Did you like Olaf too?
user2: There should be more of it
user2: Yes, I think he's cute.
user2: I like how they gave him a lot of different emotions
user1: His expressions were really well done.  Him loving summer was hilarious.
user2: I know!
user2: Isn't it the best selling cartoon movie?
user1: It's got to be, right?  And really high up in sales for all movies.
user2: All the products def boosted sales too
user2: I liked the trolls
user2: I can't believe Elsa was 21
user1: I was surprised by that too!  I thought they were both teenagers.
user2: Same
user2: I liked the concept of the true love scene
user1: Oh, I was just thinking about that!  I like that it leaves room for people to love each other in different ways.
user2: Kind of like Maleficent 
user1: Good point!
user1: And the twist with Hans... that he wasn't interested in her at all...
user2: I didn't like him
user2: Typical dude
user1: He seemed just dull at first, then... evil!!
user1: At least Kristoff was nice.
user2: Yeah.
user2: Nice chatting

conversation:
user1: Hey, so how did you like the movie?
user1: Personally, I really liked it. I have a young daughter, so of course she loved it. Luckily it was never one of those movies that she made me watch on repeat, but I liked it enough. The plot was cute, and the music is really catchy. 
user2: I loved it, the characters were great. Elsa and Anna were fantastic 
user2: It was one that could be watched over and over. My daughter loves it, and sings along to every song. 
user1: I agree, I thought they did a really good job of creating two female characters who, even though are a typical Disney princess, stood their ground and didn't necessarily count on the men in the film to help them a whole lot. 
user2: That is what i loved about this movie. It teacheds independance instead of someone coming to save them. What was your favorite part. 
user1: I also thought it was a creative interpretation of the tale it was based off, "The Snow Queen."
user2: Yes it was, I think it would be a great musical on Broadway as well. 
user1: That would be amazing! I'm sure it would do really well there
user2: I loved the way they showed her having to control the use of her powers. Shows young women that they are in control of their actions. Would you agree 
user1: I would agree with that for sure. Indina Menzel, who plays Elsa, has such a great voice, and so does Kristen Bell, who plays Anna. 
user2: Yes she does, it is captivating 
user1: I hope that it gets turned into a Broadway musical, I'd love to see how they would set the stage and who they would ge to play the characters
user2: Do you typically like action cartoon movies 
user1: Yes I love them
user2: I do as well, frozen is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. 
user1: Yeah it has been one of my more recent favorites
user2: Do you think they will make a frozen 2
user1: Yeah I think they are in the next year or so. I'm surprised the music is so good because I know Howard Ashman didn't write the music for it 
user2: Do you agree with the rotten tomatoes rating of 89% ? I think it was a fair rating, could have been a bit higher though 
user1: Yeah I agree it could be a bit higher 
user2: Metacritics only gave is a 74/100 that is way off. 
user1: I think that's a bit low for sure
user2: Olaf made the movie alot more funny. Without the character it would have lacked in comedy 
user1: I agree, he was really funny. I loved his whole blissful ignorance attitude. It made the film a lot more light hearted in the more serious scenes. 
user1: I also really liked Kristoff's character and his moose. They were pretty funny as well. 
user2: They were hillarious, when they were in the barn and the moose was there making faces was the best. 
user1: Yeah that was a good part. I like when he takes her to meet the trolls and Olaf and Anna thinks he's crazy 
user2: That was so funny, I need to go watch it  again. 

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello there
user1: Did you get the information to read?
user2: I did. I am reading it now
user2: Did you?
user1: ok awesome
user1: No it said only you would . 
user1: Not unless I get one after you 
user2: I'm going to tell you why you should see the 2013 Disney animated film Frozen. 
user1: Ok. I have been deabating on seeing it.
user2: Excellent. Then let me put your mind to ease. 
user2: Not only is Frozen rated 89% favorable on Rotten Tomatoes, it's also received a Cinema score at A+
user1: I heard it was good.
user2: It's a wonderful tale, taken from Hans Christian Anderson's "The Snow Queen". 
user2: Are you familiar with the story?
user1: I have heard a little about it .
user1: I never knew that was the original name.
user2: Prepare yourself for what I'm about to tell you - because not only is Frozen Disney's 53rd animated feature film. but it is also a musical. 
user2: I feel that telling you details of the plot would do the film injustice. Frozen is a film that needs to be experienced. 
user1: I think it would be a really good family film. 
user1: I have a daughter that would like it I am not to sure about my son.
user2: family or no family, this film will be life changing
user2: Your daughter will lose her mind as she is introduced to Elsa, a 21yr old princess who has magic snow powers. 
user1: sounds like a good time. What was your favorite part?
user2: All the parts were my favorites. 
user2: from beginning to end this movie takes you on an adventure into the snow-capped mountains of arendelle
user1: I can really picture myself there.
user2: reindeer, witty snowman, a giant ice castle, love, it's all there
user1: is it a comedy?
user2: Anna, a main character - also a princess, is voiced by Kristen Bell... not to be confused with Christain Bale. He did Batman. 
user2: Do you know of any Disney animated film that is not a comedy?
user1: I dont think mulan was 
user1: pinocchio wasnt that funny to me either
user2: Mulan is a discussion best saved for another time. 
user1: This is one sounds like a good one maybe we will check it out.
user2: Monstro has to be one of the greatest villains of all time. 
user2: Monstro is from Pinocchio - but I digress
user1: Not many people even know about that. lol Showing my age, but back to this Frozen movie you were talking about is there a love interest in it like all the other princess movies ?
user2: The love interest is not as superficial as other Disney movies (The Little Mermaid, for example). 
user1: Awesome

conversation:
user2: Hi! Excited to hear about the movie.
user1: Hello! The movie we are going to be talking about is The Disney movie Frozen.
user2: Oh great! When did it come out?
user1: It was released  in 2013
user2: Cool. Is it animated or live-action?
user1: It is an animated comedy adventure movie, with great music. A really good family movie.
user2: Is the protagonist male or female?
user1: The lead character is Anna Princess of Arendelle
user2: That sounds neat. Does she have any notable friends or family in the movie?
user1: She has an older sister, Elsa. Elsa is the Queen and has magical abilities. She can create/ control snow and ice.
user2: Oh wow. I like animated films with magic. Does Anna have a romantic interest?
user1: Yes, Kristoff who helps accompanies Anna on her journey. They don't know right away but they come together in the end.
user2: That sounds like I movie I would really like. 
user2: What style are the songs in?
user1: The songs are broadway style, there are really great songs. Let it go is my personal favorite.
user2: Oh, I love Broadway! Are there any famous people in it as the voice actors?
user1: Kristen Bell is Anna, Idina Menzel is Elsa and Jonathan Groff as Kristoff
user2: Oh Idina Menzel is amazing, and Jonathan Groff is an absolute treasure. Who directed it?
user1: It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee 
user2: Who composed the music?
user1: Christophe Beck, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez composed the music.
user2: That's awesome. Is it appropriate for all ages?
user1: Yes all of my kids love it, and my nieces too.
user1: Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses cryokinetic magic, often using it to play with heryounger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, theKing and Queen, rush both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He healsAnna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa’s magic, warning Elsa that she mustlearn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsashuts out Anna, causing a rift between them. Elsa suppresses her magic rather thanmastering it, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, theirparents die at sea during a storm.
user2: Wow, sounds great and intense. Does it end on a happy note?
user1: When Elsa turns twenty-one, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified thatthe kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear for her. The castle gatesopen to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years.  Elsa’s coronation happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentallyunleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees thekingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching theNorth Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of ice in which to live asolitary life.
user2: So would you describe it as a story of self-discovery?
user1: Definitely yes
user2: That's really important for kids. Are there themes and jokes that work for adults as well?
user1: Yes there are doses of comedy along the way, when Anna goes to find Elsa she meets Kristoff who is accompanied by his pet reindeer and then a creation that Elsa made accidentally Olaf. Olaf is a snowman and he is very funny.
user2: Very cool; thanks! I think I would like to see this movie. I appreciate your help.

conversation:
user1: DO you like animated comedies ?
user2: Yes, very much so
user2: Have you seen Frozen?
user1: I recently watched Frozen for the first time in forever . 
user2: I have too many kids. I think I know it by heart, lol
user1: It is the best animated musical from Disney in a whil e
user2: You think so? I like it but I prefer Moana or Coco over Frozen
user1: I have no seen either of those . 
user2: Well then, you must someday. 
user1: I really like the Snowman Olaf 
user2: He's adorable. My kids love him too. My 3 yr old has a Olaf costume
user1: I seen so many children wearing Elsa costumes last year on Halloween , not so much Ana 
user1: I see it got a 89% on rotten tomatoes . That is a pretty good score 
user2: That's true. Most children dress up as the main characters rather than the supporting characters
user2: I agree
user1: I think it would be a good broadway play 
user1: I do think the reindeer is a bit funny
user1: much needed comic relief
user2: I also agree with that. I have seen Aladdin and Lion King on off broadway in Los Angeles. I definitely think Frozen would be fun to watch on broadway
user1: same with Olaf 
user2: I agree
user1: 3D animation has come along way 
user1: Elsa is not a monser even though that is what the Duke thinks 
user1: love the rock trolls 
user2: Absolutely. If you think it's great watching Frozen, just wait until you see the advancements in Coco. 
user2: .. referring to 3D animation
user1: OH . must be good . have to wait for it to come out on blue ray 
user2: the rock trolls are funny
user1: All the actors they chose for the movie were fantastic 
user2: I agree and so vocally talented
user1: I had no idea Kirsten Bell could sing . 
user2: I wouldn't expect anything less from Disney, truth be told
user1: Disney is pretty top notch
user2: neither did I. I was a little more familiar with idina Menzel
user1: HAve to up hold the disney legacy 
user2: absolutely. Disney sets a high standard to meet
user1: IT is disneys 53rd animated film 
user2: I saw that. That's impressive.
user1: I love that the movie is set the same universe as other movies . like hidden easter egs

conversation:
user2: What did you think about frozen? I thought it was a great kids movie. 
user1: Frozen was perfect for both adults and kids 
user2: I agree, my kids have watched it multiple times. Who is your favorite character? 
user1: Very catchy songs and portrayed sisters well - my favorite character is elsa 
user1: actually ollaf 
user1: What about you?
user2: My favorite was olaf, his charm and wit added alot of comedy to the movie. 
user2: Did you know it was based off of the original snow queen 
user1: I agree - Both Olaf and the lumberjack in the movie made it great for the entire family 
user1: and I did not know that 
user2: What was your favorite scene 
user1: Olaf melting 
user2: Haha that was funny, my favorite was when her sister came to find her in the ice castle. 
user1: Oh that was a really good one too 
user2: What did you think about the rating that rotten tomatoes gave of 89%? I thought it was fair
user1: I think that was fair as well 
user1: Although this seemed to mark some cultural relevance and reaffirmation of Disney, a lot of people still do not agree with the idea of a disney princess

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you?
user1: Hi, Im good thanks. How are you?
user2: I'm ok
user1: Have you seen the movie Frozen?
user2: I have not, I've somehow managed to avoid it
user2: I feel like I wouldn't really like it, I'm not really a fan of musicals
user1: It wasnt that bad. I liked it. Its an animated comedy adventure directed by Chris buck and Jennifer Lee
user1: It's about a princess and her sister. 
user2: I didn't realize that it was a 3D movie
user1: They all seem to be anymore. 
user1: Walt Disney has a bunch \
user2: I didn't realize that Kristen Bell was the voice of Anna
user1: Yes, and Tyree Brown was 8 year old Kristoff. 
user2: Have they come out with a Broadway version of it yet? I haven't heard anything about it, but I'm not up on all the latest when it comes to Broadway.
user1: Too bad you dont like musicals, the critics say this was the best animated musical to come out of disney since the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
user1: I was wondering the same about Broadway but it seems so. 
user2: Interesting. I feel like I'd be more willing to see it on Broadway than the movie.
user1: Would you watch the this version if you liked the Broadway one?
user2: Probably, just to see if it was better
user1: I didnt know that the power Princess Elsa had is named, "cryokinetic magic"
user1: A great big snowy pleasure. I dont really like snow ..do you?
user2: They couldn't just call it the frozen magic?
user1: right!
user2: No, I greatly dislike snow. Maybe between that (and the musical aspect of it) has made me really not want to watch it. I generally do watch animated movies, but I just couldn't get behind this one
user1: I hear that. You will like it..its just plain terrific bit of family entertainment. 
user2: After reading the information though, it sounds like maybe I might like it
user1: The eternal winter is a scary thing, to think that was a childrens story. The Snow Queen.
user2: Eternal winter? That sounds absolutely horrible
user1: I wouldnt be able to sleep after that
user2: I KNOW... I'm reading this thinking-- this is meant for kids and it's making me uneasy
user1: Horror 
user2: But it's labeled as comedy
user2: So hopefully there are some funny parts
user1: At least we have songs to sing so that helps

user1: For all of world

conversation:
user2: Idina Menzel was playing the role of Elsa.
user1: Kristen Bell was Anna
user2: Frozen came out in 2013.
user1: It was a very entertaining movie. Do you agree with the ratings?
user2: One critic said it was the best animated movie to come out since the death of Howard Ashman.
user1: Another one says that it lags on the way to the ending.
user2: I did not know that the movie came out in 3D.
user1: It would be interesting to see Elsa throwing Ice at me in 3D. Scary
user2: Yes. I like that they made a 3D movie. I had not seen one in a while.
user1: My favorite character was the reindeer
user2: Did you know there was a Broadway musical?
user1: Yes. I would like to see how they portray the scene when Elsa hurts Anna.
user2: Do you feel that Frozen was better than the Little Mermaid?
user1: I don't know about that but did you know that it is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tail called "the snow queen"
user2: No. I did not know that. It seems to have gotten and A+ on CinemaScore.
user1: Also 89% on Rotten tomatoes. I thought it might be higher than that
user2: It was even worse on Metacritics. They gave it a 74/100. Interesting.
user1: It was interesting that Elsa remained distant from Anna even through the coronation. 
user2: Elsa was hurt and did not feel so well.
user1: She accidentally unleashed her powers before the court. 
user2: Yes. I am pretty sure she did unleash her powers at that time. She was terrified about the people finding out about her powers.
user1: The worst moment is when everyone is there to see her and to witness the coronation. 
user2: I think they classified the movie as a comedy but I felt it was a drama.
user1: It was comedic when the marshmallow monster chased olaf off a cliff
user2: I can see how that would be quite funny. Lol.
user1: It was also dramatic when Anna goes to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne. He didn't really love her
user2: Yes. I think there were many funny moments as well as many dramatic moments.
user1: It really hit the bliss point
user2: I agree.

conversation:
user2: Hi. Have you ever seen the movie Frozen?
user1: yes, I have.
user2: I saw it in the Theater when it came out. When did you see it?
user1: I saw it when it came out on DVD. 
user2: Cool. Who was your favorite character?
user1: I liked Anna played by actress Kristen Bell
user2: Nice. I actually liked Kristoff played by Jonathan Groff.
user1: He was very good as well.
user2: Yes he was. His friendship with his reindeer was very funny to watch.
user1: Sven was very funny.
user2: The song he sang to Sven was my favorite. lol. Which songs did you enjoy?
user1: I like "Do You Want to Build A Snowman"
user2: That's a great song. I likes the three different ages for the song.
user1: yes, Kristen Bell voiced the older Anna while Katie Lopez and Agatha Lee Monn voiced her at ages 5 and 9.
user2: I wonder how old those actresses were that sang. If they were close to the ages of the characters.
user1: I do not have  that information.
user2: Me either. Just being curious.
user2: What years did Frozen come out?
user1: It came out in 2013.
user2: That sounds about right. The reviews on it are great I think.
user1: Yes it was a very popular and critically acclaimed film.
user2: I think Rotten Tomatoes gave it right around 90% approval
user1: Yes, and the CinemaScore was A+. Audiences really connected with the film.
user2: That's what makes a good film. If the audience can put themselves in it and relate to the characters.
user1: When Anna is accidentally hit by an ice blast audiences feel genuine empathy for her. 
user2: You feel for both of them. The guilt Elsa felt and the fear for Anna
user1: I did not relate too much to Elsa she seemed cold.
user2: I enjoyed her at the beginning as a kid. Then she became annoying towards her powers
user1: She seemed rather self-abosorbed
user1: oh dear
user1: hello

conversation:
user1: Hi!  What do you think of the Disney Animated movie Frozen?
user2: I love Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel's singing
user2: Did you think it was well made?
user1: I think the 3D effects were great, and I sobbed like a baby more than once, it was so emotional in parts. I think it was right up there with Beauty and the Beast, how about you?  
user2: I agree. I loved the 3D animation. 
user2: How did you feel about the songs?
user1: I must say I love snowy films, living where its hot. Eh, they were good, but nothing I would put on my playlist after I left the theater.  Any movie with a snowman in it though makes my heart melt. Did you like the Snowman and Iceman?
user2: Yes I did. I think CinemaScore nailed it with an A+ rating.
user1: I think so too, though Rotten Tomotoes could have upped it a bit, though a high rating I think it deserved even higher.  Would you see it again?
user2: Definitely. I would even own it on DVD. Do you think you would buy it?
user1: I don't know, we already have so many Disney movies from when I was growing up still on VHS tape!  But I suppose if I saw it on sale I could grab it.  It's a perfect movie for summer and family night.
user2: Did you like the beginning, middle, or end more?
user1: I like them all, but mostly the beginning and middle, though I am still trying to figure out what cryokinetic magic is. Do you know?
user2: I think it may be the art of freezing things, maybe?
user2: I personally liked the middle the best because it was so light hearted
user1: Yeah well, kids know more about that fancy magic stuff than I do. Though I did like the trolls, I think they were graphically or CG generated or however you say that, great!
user2: I feel like this would do really well on Broadway, don't you?
user1: I agree with you there completely.  And the music performed live would be fantastic.  But then again a story with two kids locked in a castle might not be the same on stage as it would be in the film.  And animals are never the best performers on stage. I guess they could get 2 people in a reindeer suit for that.  Though I bet the Broadway version on the King and Queen's costume would never be as epic as it was in the film.
user2: I agree, the ice castle might also be quite challenging to replicate on stage
user1: True. How did you like the part after they grew up, and Elsa is courted by the two gents?
user2: I'm not sure which part you're talking about?
user2: Did you know it was Disney's 53rd animated feature film?
user1: After she grew up and was crowned the queen, the castle gates were opened and she got two suiters. Lucky her, and of course she had to run away. No I didn't know that, that makes me feel OLD.  Did you know it was inspired by A Han's Christian Anderson fairy tale?
user2: No I didn't. I actually didn't know who Han's Christian Anderson was before this movie. I heard it was based on his works called "The Snow Queen"
user2: I'm assuming that's who Prince Hans got his name from.
user1: Perhaps, did he wear a crown?  All I can recall is Elsa leaving the kingdom and making it cold and that other guy, the Duke, calling her a Monster.  That's no way to -get the girl- if you ask me.
user2: Yeah he later locks Anna in a room to die after Elsa freezes her heart, he definitely isn't a ladies man
user1: I know right, too bad she didn't like trolls because Grand Pabble seemed like a really nice healer fellow-troll.  In some ways it reminds me of the old princess kisses the frog stories. 
user2: What did you think of the Giant snow creature Elsa creates?
user1: I loved the name of it, Marshmallow.  That made the kids laugh, me too.  But I think Anna really needed a beauty salon after her hair started turning white at such a young age.  What did you think with that plot twist with Hans?
user2: I thought it was shocking. But relieved that Elsa escaped from the detention cell Han's puts her in.
user1: Yeah, I really hated him towards the end, and then he put Anna in a room to die and wanted to execute the queen!  SO much for love!
user2: Right! He is really nasty
user2: Have a good night!
user1: You too!

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hi
user2: How do you feel about this movie?
user1: Frozen is a great movie.
user2: My daughter is in love with it. It is pretty cure. Do you like Anna or Elsa?
user1: I like Elsa more.
user2: It must suck to have your parents die huh?
user1: It sure does. That was sad.
user2: I wish I could freeze things, what about you?
user1: Would make things funner. Could have your own winter anytime.
user2: What is the first thing you would do if you could freeze things or make snow or whatever?
user1: I would make ice for any drink I have.
user2: I think winter is beautiful, do you like it?
user1: Yes. The movie makes me want winter all the time.
user2: That prince hans is such a scumbag, don't you think?
user1: Yes. He is too arrogant.
user2: What is your favorite winter sport?
user1: The high jump
user2: Would you live in an ice palace?
user1: If I don't get frostbite, sure.
user2: Don't you think it is said when Anna's heart freezes?
user2: sad
user1: Yes, very heartbreaking.
user2: Were you relieved when Elsa escaped the cell that Hans puts her in?
user1: I did. Glad she escaped.

user1: Hi, so we are talking about the movie Frozen
user2: Kristen Bell was great as Anna in the movie!
user1: I have seen this movie several times and liked it, I would enjoy seeing the broadway show
user2: I never knew that it was based off "The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen.
user2: I would also love seeing it turned into a Broadway show
user2: Of course, the reindeer Sven and Olaf the snowman steal the show!
user2: Do you enjoy movies of this genre?

conversation:
user1: So what did you think of the movie? even though its meant for children i thought it was pretty funny.
user2: I thought it was wonderful. I like that it is a family entertainment film that everyone can enjoy. 
user2: I think the Broadway-style music is wonderful addition to a family movie. What did you think? 
user2: I also loved the fact it was a Disney animation comedy. I love Disney animation. Don't you just love to be surprised by the witty adult humor in a children's movie. 
user2: Oh and I had no idea that this was inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. I love them all. Did you know this? 

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: Hi. I love this movie!
user2: i kinda like it 
user1: I didn't know it was based on anything but it's based on The Snow Queen. That's pretty neat

user2: it says here 2013
user2: oh ok 
user1: That seems soo long ago since it's 2018
user2: my grandchildren love it

user1: *they
user2: yes they do 
user2: my youngest had her party from it

user1: It would be an awesome adult movie too if made with real actors. The plot sounds like it could be pretty vertsatline

user1: Haha, kids don't have good attention spans
user2: no they dont especially mine lol

conversation:
user1: This sounds like a great movie!
user2: Frozen is such a great movie! Kristen Bell is the perfect actress to play the voice of Anna! Disney made this movie for all ages which is great!
user1: Yes, it's something I can feel good about watching with my kids.
user2: I agree! Not only is it acceptable for all ages, but it's even entertaining for us adults! How about the amazing responses from the critics!?
user1: That is quite different, to have all the critics like it.
user2: Yes, it seems like critics who care about the quality of the film as well as critics who are looking at the big picture of showing this to the masses all agree! Very cool!
user1: I love being able to watch something entertaining and uplifting as well.
user2: Family entertainment is perfect for that! This has one of the highest Rotten Tomatoes scores I've ever seen with 89%! Did you notice how high the ratings are? 
user1: Yes, but I'm not too familiar with Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritics, so I wasn't sure how that compared to other movies they have rated.
user2: I am familiar with Rotten Tomatoes and they are a very reputable company/website! Plus to see an A+ from Cinemascore is very cool too!
user1: Yes, I was impressed with that A+.
user2: I see that one of the key scenes is when Princess Elsa possesses her magic! Sounds very cool.
user1: I wonder what cryokinetic magic is?
user2: I was wondering the same thing! It seems like you may need to be from Arendelle!
user1: Yes, for sure.
user2: Do you believe it was said to be the best animated musical to come out since The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast?
user1: It's great to know that excellent movies are still possible!
user2: Did you know this was inspired by the fairy tale "The Snow Queen"?
user1: Yes, it did state that in the information.  I am not sure if I remember that story.
user2: I have never heard of that specific story but I have heard of Hans Christian Andersen who wrote The Little Mermaid!
user1: Yes and I know most of his stories, so I probably have heard it.
user2: Amazing writer! Have you heard of the other two main voice actors in this film? Idina Menzel and Jonathan Groff?
user1: I have heard of Idina Menzel, though I can't picture her right now.
user2: I see. It looks like there are some conflicts that occur with Elsa, Anna and Kristoff at the ice palace.
user1: Conflict always makes a good story.
user2: Agreed. The antagonist seems to be Kristoff. Leaving Anna in a room to die!
user1: I think Prince Hans is actually the antagonist.
user2: You are correct! I read that wrong, thank you for clarification!
user1: No problem.

conversation:
user1: Do you like computer-animated movies? Particularly musicals?
user2: They're usually pretty interesting, I haven't seen many however. 
user1: There is a fanatastic one that came out in 2013, called Frozen.. Have you heard of it?!
user2: Yes, I have heard of it! I have not seen it however. What is it about?
user1: Well it was based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairty tale "The Snow Queen", and tells the story of a fearless princess and the friends she makes on her journey as well as her estranged sister and their relationship
user2: That sounds pretty fun to watch. Do the songs also relate to the old fairy tale as well?
user1: I'm not sure, unfortunately I don't know much about the original fairy tale. But he songs are truly captivating! 
user2: It does sound like a good movie! Do you know the best way to watch the movie in case I do want to watch it sometime?
user1: I would suggest renting a copy
user2: Do you know who the main voice actress is for the main character? 
user1: Yes! Idina Menzel plays Elsa, she is the main character. The fearless princess with ice powers!
user2: The main character sounds like quite the character. How well did the movie rate among critics?
user1: Metaciritics gave it a 74, but rotten tomatoes gave it an 89% and cinemaScore was an A+
user2: I've always used rotten tomato's audience rating as the true rating for a movie, so it must be a very good movie! Is it a children's movie then or is it for more mature audiences?
user1: I believe ultimately it was created as a Disney Children's movie, however it is enjoyable for adults and childrena like
user2: Gotcha, Disney always knows how to make movies for everyone I guess. How long is the movie?
user1: 1 hour and 49 minutes 
user2: At least it's not too long, there's certainly movies that are hard to finish because they are 2+ hours. Have you personally seen the movie?
user1: oh yes, and i loved it very much. My favorite seen is probably when Elsa turns 21 and is about to be crowned Queen.. She is terrified that the citizens may find out about her powers!
user2: That does sound like quite the story! I'm curious, how does Elsa's sister play a role in this movie if they're worried about finding out about her powers?

conversation:
user1: I don't really go for musical films
user2: But it is a Disney movie, which all Disney films incorporate music but also tell a good story.
user1: Also has awesome ratings.
user2: Right. I think for kids it would be great. 
user1: From this looks like the best disney movie
user2: I don't know about the best Disney movie but with the ratings it has, I think it could be considered one of the best.
user1: Would you watch it?
user2: Probably, but the most attractive part is the fact that it is a Disney movie
user1: I love 3D movies and this is 3D.
user2: We all grew up with Disney movies in our home so I like to stay up to date and see the advancements they come up with.
user1: I don't really know what the snow queen is all about
user2: I immediately think of Snow White, wasn't she the snow queen?  
user1: Interesting
user2: I don't recognize any of the names they have doing voices.  Sometimes it is fun to recognize a voice. 
user1: Yeah! Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it. 
user2: Which causes insecurity. and she has to shut her sister out.  
user1: I have no clue about the names listed either
user2: Arendelle? is that a real place?
user1: I doubt it 
user1: It must be truly magical watching this in 3D.
user2: I would imagine it is pretty cool.  I like how they say that you can picture the broadway play right there while watching the movie.
user1: Renewed cultural relevance? Were they feeling ancient
user2: 53rd Disney animated feature.  How many of those 53 have you seen?
user1: Who was the iceman. 
user2: Not sure, but Marshmallow doesn't sound like someone to mess with.
user1: Not many! 
user1: Marshmaollow!!! That's a funny name
user2: The trolls and Grand Pebble are Kristoff's adoptive family?  What? that seems a little far fetche
user2: d
user1: It must be pretty cold leaving in ice. I would hate it.
user2: Yeah not something I would want

user1: oh, that's right, I mixed the names up
user1: Ana is the older one
user1: Who is the voice of the male character?
user2: Ana, is 18 and Elsa is 21. The male character is voiced by Johnathan Groff as Kristoff
user2: I have two sons,  they were never interested in the movie. 
user1: I always wanted to see the movie after all the fame it got, especially the song and the merchandise. 
user2: Yeah me too. 
user1: I wonder if this movie will have a sequel
user2: The way it got so famous,  probably.  
user2: I think it'll be a good movie. Totally should see it before the other one comes out. 
user1: I'd better see the first part before the sequel is released
user1: Did this movie receive any awards?
user2: Yeah it wouldn't make any sense then.  
user2: Rotten Tomatoes  gave it 89%
user2: Metacritic 74/100
user1: That seems a bit low for how well it did
user2: I think if kids rated it,  it would defiantly be higher haha
user1: Yes, I'm sure
user1: Plus the animation was very good too
user1: Idina Menzel sang that famous song from the movie
user1: I have heard so many covers of that song!
user2: Yeah I heard it was.  Yeah, Let It Go  I think. 
user1: Yes, that's the one
user2: Would you watch it by yourself or have your kids if you have any watch it with you? 
user1: My kids already saw it with their friends, so guess, by myself
user1: unless they want to see it again
user2: You know it was the 53 Disney animated film?

user2: The animated, 3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential.
user2: It all seems so cynical, this attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much. "Frozen" just happens to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition of the superior 
user2: When they were young girls, sisters Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa's special power—her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips—comes back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister.

user1: hey how are you?
user2: hi good you?
user1: Real good just about to watch a movie, any suggestions?
user2: Hmmmm, how about Frozen?
user1: I haven't seen it yet, whos in it?
user2: Looks like a good movie based on its scores
user2: Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff
user1: Some of my favorites, is that an animated movie?
user2: Yes, it is
user1: I love them kinds, how were the reviews
user2: Well, Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 89%, Metacritic 74/100, and Cinemascore gives it an A+
user1: Highly rated as well, mind tell ing me a little bit about what the movie is about?
user2: "the film tells the story of a fearless princess who sets off on a journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer, and a naive snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter"
user1: That sounds good to me, wonder how they proceed.
user2: I've never seen the movie myself, so I'm unsure
user1: Anything else you want to add about it?
user2: Oh, apparently the main character possesses cryokinetic magic, and is locked away in a castle because of that, at some point
user1: And maybe they have to escape?
user2: Possibly. The plot seems to contradict itself on that point, or it just doesn't tell what happens in between
user2: Strange
user2: Apparently, the movie is labelled under the genre comedy, adventure, and animation
user2: adventure and animation I would've guessed, but didn't know it was a comedy too
user1: I do enjoy comedies, yeah it seems more adventerous to me though with the mission?
user2: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking
user1: Any other cool facts or nah?
user2: I mean, not really, I'm just trying to maintain the conversation so we can finish lol
user1: I see I see, well I'll probably check it out, my daughter likes disney movies
user2: Seems like a good movie, I remember when it was released, people went nuts about it. I'm sure your daughter will enjoy it
user1: She definitely has one of the dolls from the movie
user2: Awesome, so she's already familiar with it then, huh?
user1: Definitely might have to ask her about it after this

conversation:
user1: Hi, what did you think of the movie Frozen?  I loved it!
user2: I also enjoyed it. 
user1: Did you like the singing?  I thought Anna's voice was really good.
user2: Yes, I did like the singing. 
user2: Elsa's voice was also good. 
user1: Yes, she had a beautiful voice, and the best song to sing.
user2: I read The Snow Queen years ago, and really liked it. 
user1: I never read that, but I probably should
user2: It was good. I liked it. 
user1: I agree with the critics, it was the best disney musical in a long time.
user2: Agreed! We listened to many of the songs over and over again. 
user1: I had no idea ice superpowers was called cryokinetic magic. 
user2: Right! I didn't either. 
user2: I don't get why they had to remove the memories from Anna. Couldn't they have just explained to her what happened? 
user1: I thought Elsa's parents went about hiding her powers all wrong.  they should have tried teaching her control, not suppress it.
user1: exactly!
user1: typical disney movie to kill off the parents!
user2: Typical. Parents get in the way. Hijinks can't ensue if there are parents around to say "That's a bad idea" 
user1: my mom's favorite line "no more shenanigans!"
user1: Han's was such a jerk!
user2: Like, if there had been a dad or mom here they would have said, "Everybody calm down. There are no monsters here." 
user2: yes, he was! 
user1: I can't believe Anna fell for his antics
user2: I can. It's the first person her own age she's seen in years who is actually interested in her. 
user1: hm, i suppose that's true.  she needed more playdates growing up.
user2: She had no friends after her parents died the only people she saw were the servants and Elsa. 
user2: I always wondered what happened to Kristoff's parents. 
user2: And why did he have a reindeer? What happened to Sven's parents? 
user1: you'd think the servants would have kids.  oh well.  at least eventually she gets olaf back.  yeah, they never did give him a decent back story
user1: kristoff, raised by troll people!
user2: I would think the servants would have kids. But it definitely shows Anna always being alone and longing for Elsa to play with her. 
user2: Kristoff races her back to Hans, even though he's fallen in love with her himself. 
user1: yup, it's a great movie about sisterly love, but you can't dig too deep into the storyline!
user2: exactly. 

conversation:
user1: Hello.
user2: Hello!
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: It's about a princess who freezes the whole city and leaves. Her sister takes off trying to find her.
user1: Are the actors good?
user2: Along the way the sister finds some new friends, one being a reindeer and a prince. It's a really good movie, I enjoy watching it with my kids
user2: It's sort of sad, the girls parents died
user1: Can the movie attract a wide range of audience?
user2: It can, i believe most people would like the movie
user2: Honestly I didnt want to watch it at first, but it's a really good movie and kind of sucks you in
user2: It's actually got really good reviews on 3 different pages
user1: Did the screenplay keep moving, keep you interested?
user2: Yes, it keeps your attention
user1: Is it comparable to fantasy or drama?
user2: It's more of drama
user1: Sad, or uplifting?
user2: It has all emotions wrapped up in it
user1: Does the film have a chance to win an Academy Award?
user2: It did
user1: Did people seem to like it at the theater?
user2: They did, it reached a record while in the theater
user1: Was the director skillful with the camera?
user2: very much so
user1: What would you rate the movie from 1 to 5 stars?
user2: I would give it 4 stars
user1: Would you pay to see it again?
user2: I would
user1: Would you take your children to see it?
user2: Yes, we have seen it together numerous times. They love it

conversation:
user1: What do you think of the voice cast of Frozen?
user2: They were good.
user1: Do you think the rating given to the movie was fair? Which was most fair?
user2: I think the ratings are fair. I think the Rotten Tomatoes rating is closest to how I would rate the movie
user1: I agree! It seems fair considering how much people seemed to like the movie. Who was your favorite character?
user2: The snowman, but I can't remember his name.
user1: I think it was an interesting choice to have multiple voice actors for the same characters at different ages. What are your thoughts on that?
user2: It was probably challenging for the actors unless they manipulated their voices electronically. Am I supposed to ask you questions too or just respond to yours?
user1: Yes it was definitely essential if they wanted a younger cast throughout the movie. And I think having the characters at multiple ages was essential to what they wanted to do seeing as it was well-liked. You can ask questions as well, I believe. This is supposed to be an engaging conversation about the movie.
user2: Did you know it was in 3D? For some reason I didn't know that.
user1: Yes! I think that might have made the scene where Elsa accidentally hurts Anna more powerful. Do you think that Elsa has cool powers?
user2: Her powers were cool. I didn't know they were making it into a play did you?
user1: I think they are saying it could be made into a play, not that they would. But it would be a nice play!
user2: Have you read the book it was based on?
user1: I have not! I haven't read most of Hans Christian Andesen's work, but this one I hadn't even heard of. Have you?
user2: No, I haven't read much of Andersen's works. What was your favorite song?
user1: I am not sure what songs there were, but what did you think of the Duke of Weselton?
user2: The Duke wasn't very nice! Who was it that proposed to Anna?
user1: Hans ended up proposing to Anna, but Elsa was not a fan. Do you think she overreacted? 
user2: Maybe a bit! Do you think it was wise of Elsa to suppress her magic rather than mastering it?
user1: I definitely think it wasn't a good idea. Perhaps it was the fact that her parents died when she was a teenager and they didn't give her much direction. THey probably could have helped her practice.
user2: Do you think it was a good idea to separate the girls after Elsa injured Anna?
user1: I don't think so. They have such tumult later in life, with Elsa accidentally freezing Anna's heart. Then Hans is so cruel to the both of them.
user1: Did you expect Hans would be so cruel?
user2: What did you think of Marshmallow? I sort of suspected that Hans wasn't what he seemed, he was just too perfect.
user1: Marshmallow seems to be an embodiment of the "evil" of Elsa. He is the cruel ice monster that hurts Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf in their journey. However, it is a super cute name. Unfortunately he is mean.
user1: Elsa is only 21. Do you think that is young to become a queen?
user2: Maybe a little young, but I'm sure others might have been younger. What was it that could reverse the spell placed on Anna?
user1: They said it was an act of true love, but Hans ended up not allowing that to happen. He could never have been the act of true love that was needed.
user1: It seems the trolls know the most about Elsa's magic. They should have trained her from the start!
user2: I hope this ends soon, I having trouble coming up with new questions! Was Elsa able to escape Hans?
user1: She was able to escape her detention cell! Hopefully she could do more to stop him.
user2: I agree that the trolls should have trained Elsa.

conversation:
user1: Have you seen Frozen?
user2: I have! I love that movie!
user1: So did I! I didn't realize it was based off of "The Snow Queen."
user2: I really liked the snowman.
user1: Olaf!! Yes, me too. I am not surprised that Rotten Tomatoes rated it 89%, 
user2: But yah, I like how it was based on teh Snow queen, I thought that was pretty cool. 
user1: Quite the story when you think about it! Who would think about giving a sister icy powers?
user1: Eternal winter would be awful!!
user2: The movie was really emotional!
user1: It really was. Yet it was great for the whole family. I love Disney movies.
user2: Me too, they're so great. I loved how fearless Ana was!
user1: So did I! Have you heard if this has made it to Broadway yet?
user2: I'm not sure if it's on Broadway, but it wouldn't surprise me if it were
user1: It would make a great musical! I heard that some have said this is as deep as a Pixar film.
user2: it really is! I was surprised Disney could pull it off as well as they did.
user2: The voice actors they chose were perfect, I was kind of shocked at that too!
user1: It was different from most Disney films. And I agree, the voices were great. Terrific family entertainment. Disney stepped it up a notch with this one. 
user2: I can't believe it's only the 53rd Disney film though. II would have thought they had more
user2: The way Disney re-imagined Elsa was perfect. 
user1: Yes, that surprised me. I always loved The Little Mermaid but enjoyed this more.
user2: Yeh, I liked the Little Mermaid, but yeah this was better. Elsa throwing away her crown was just such a moment for me. It was so freeing!
user1: Oh definitely! Can you imagine being crowned queen when you turn 21?!
user2: That would be frightening
user2: I can only imagine how Elsa felt, and with ice powers too? No wonder she thought her people would fear her!
user1: That was very freeing when she threw away her crown. But it was sad when she fled the kingdom. 
user1: It was especially sad when Elsa froze Anna's heart.
user2: The ending was so tragic! I was so upset when he locked Ana in a room to die, how horrible!
user2: That part when her heart got frozen was so sad for me. I elt so bad for her!
user1: I know! I liked when Kristoff took anna to Hans to giver her her true love's kiss.
user1: But then the shock came!!
user2: Do you mean the trolls? Because I thought they were funny!
user2: I was was scared when Marshmallow chased them out though, he was pretty big!
user1: Oh yes, I loved the trolls. But didn't Kristoff race Anna home to Hans?
user2: Yes he did, so Ana could kiss Hans. But then he tricked her. 
user1: And then Hans just locked her in that room to die...

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Hi 
user2: HI, did you enjoy this movie?
user1: Frozen was good, it had some good voice actresses
user2: True, I wish the movie contained more of a story line and got to the point faster and showed more of their lives. 
user1: I definitely get that, it still was one of the best animated movies Disney has come out with in a long time
user2: I miss the "older" Disney movies. They had more of a story line and didn't seem to drag on.
user1: Amazing singing for some of the cast being so young
user2: True.
user1: I didn't know it was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen
user2: That is very interesting. I wasn't aware of that either. 
user1: I don't think I would hide a child's magic powers from themselves. I feel it would make things worse
user2: I agree! I feel that part should have been brought out earlier in the movie and have gone from there into the movie more. I feel that would have made the movie better and more interesting for a lot of people. It got a bad rating from "Rotten Tomatoes"
user1: It did get some mixed reviews. 
user2: Yeah. My daughter who is 8, disliked the movie a lot. Stated that it should have contained a better story. She did note that the songs were pretty.
user1: I completely agree with her take on it 
user2: My husband just stated "They have made better" and left it at that.
user1: lol the description makes the movie sound way better
user2: By Far!
user1: I bet Prince Hans name was a tribute to Hans Christian Andersen 
user2: Probably.
user1: Sven was a cool character lol
user1: I did absolutely love little Olaf
user2: My husbands sister is obsessed with Olaf. Her whole kitchen and bathrooms are decorated in his character. 
user2: Cute, but yet not.
user1: I don't think I could decorate with him except around christmas
user2: I don't think I could ever decorate with him or any movie character. Too much stuff to store away.
user1: I just realized Frozen is similar to a broadway type snow white
user1: Nice chatting have a good evening

conversation:
user1: So what is the movie you read about?
user2: Have you seen Frozen? You really should, RottenTomatoes gave it a 89% which is pretty impressive for them.
user1: I have seen it. 89 sounds pretty good. What is that score out of? 100?
user2: Yeah, it's a percentage. Did you know that it is inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale "The Snow Queen"? That's pretty cool.
user1: I have never heard that story. Is it like a direct adaptation or just sort of influenced by the story like other Disney movies?
user2: I'm not sure. My document just tells me "inspired by". I haven't read that story either.
user1: Ah gotcha. So who are the central characters in this movie?
user2: Anna the 18 yr old princess, Elsa the Snow Queen of Arendelle and Kristoff the iceman. They are voiced by Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff respectively.
user1: And what is the central conflict?
user2: A fearless princess sets off with the iceman to find her estranged sister whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom! Aah!
user1: Sounds interesting, I would be interested in watching it again. Is it a musical?
user2: Great. Yes, it has good musical numbers. The critical response about Frozen said things like "It's also just plain terrific bit of family entertainment."
user2: Hello? Still there?
user2: Please reply! I'm gonna abort conversation...

conversation:
user1: I don't really like animation but I do like musicals.  This movie came through for me  and I liked it.  The beginning was great, it got a little slow in the middle but it picked up at the end.  
user2: I like animation, especially from Disney. I though that the movie was great. 
user1: I do like fairy tale adaptations so it was nice to see The Snow Queen redone.
user2: I did not know that it was based on a fairy tale. That is cool.
user1: The voices were well done.  Good casting!
user2: Yeah, I liked Kristen Bell, she has an amazing voice.
user1: It is one of those movies you can watch with the whole family and I think everyone will like parts of it.
user2: Yeah, the story's message is applicable to people of all ages. And the comedic side characters, Olaf and the reindeer were pretty fun.
user1: Do you watch many Disney movies?  I have but I don't always like them, Frozen was a bit different from their usual.  Loved Olaf! 
user2: I think I have watched all of the 3D computer animated Disney movie. I found all of them very well done. I mean their ratings are always very good. I think it was around 2013 when Disney moved from 2D animation to 3D.
user1: I wonder how the Broadway version will/does compare to the movie.  I have seen Elsa redone in other venues so I am guessing the recreation will be great.  I hope it captures the emotion of the movie.
user2: I do really like Broadway musicals. It is just that it you can do a lot of cool effect in 3D, but on Broadway, it has to be all practical effects. 
user1: The 3D in this movie is different from what I am used to.  I remember the old 3D where you had to wear glasses and when you did it looked like things were coming at you.  They have definitely perfected the art.  Was Pixar involved in the movie? I know Disney owns Pixar.
user2: I did not like the old version of 3D. It hurt my eyes, but that is more of a me problems. I don't think Pixar was involved in this. I think that this was a Disney only film though. Do you think this movie really renewed Disney's cultural relevance>
user2: ?
user1: I do think it renewed Disney's cultural relevance.  I found some of the other movies historically inaccurate and that was annoying to me.  Many of their other movies had outdated stereotypes.  This one was a move to strong female characters.  What do you think?
user2: Yeah, I am really happy that Disney is making more films about different cultures and about empowering women. What did you think of the story, overall? Like what made you dislike it? 
user1: Oh, I liked it.  I just normally don't like animation but this was different.  I saw it much later than its release and I heard all of the hype and I think it was very good.  I'd even watch it again!  I kind of wish they would have a sequel.  I would also like to see the play.
user2: Okay, I went in, not knowing anything about the film. If anything, I though it would be bad. But, lo and behold, it was really good. I did not expect the twist in the end where Hans becomes a bad guy.
user1: Do you agree with the rating of the movie?  I actually think it should be higher than the 89% from Rotten Tomatoes.  
user2: Yeah, I though it would be much higher. Also metacritics scored it very low. But most of the reviews are good. Do you think that middle was a bit slow? Some critics said it was a bit subpar.
user1: I don't agree with the metacritics low rating.  I was surprised it was so low.  I do think the movie lagged a little in the middle but I don't think it hurt the movie at all.
user1: D
user1: Do you think the middle of the movie lagged and made it subpar?
user2: It might for some people. I found it fine though. What made the middle lag.
user2: ?
user1: I'm not sure but do you know what the tragic death of lyricist Howard Ashman was?  How did he die?
user2: He made the song tracks for old Disney movies. I believe he died because due through natural causes. I don't really know though. The music was really good in this film though, so whoever they got now is pretty good.
user1: I agree and I do like Idina Menzel.  I saw her in Wicked.  She has a great voice.
user2: Agreed. All the actors were really good. I liked Jonathan Groff who played Kristoff.
user1: I'm happy that CinemaScore gave the movie an A+

user2: whats the mpaa ratin on it
user1: I"m sorry I don't have that information.
user2: alright
user2: whats the next film
user1: First, we need to discuss one of the key scenes in the movie. When PRincess Elsa uses her magic and accidentally injures Anna. 
user1: It causes a rift between them and Elsa suppresses her magic, causing her to become more insecure.
user2: alright that was pretty intense scene
user1: Yes, then their parents die at sea during a storm when they are teenagers. 
user2: it's what made the filmpowerful
user1: When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen but is scared people will find out about her crazy ice skills.
user2: oh yea
user1: She finally opens the gates to the public for the first time in years and one of them is the scheming Duke of Weselton.

user1: She then summons a giant snow creature.
user1: Have you ever summoned a giant snow creature named Marshmallow?
user2: no
user1: Me neither. Along their way, they meet Olaf. He's made of snow. 
user2: oh really
user1: Yes. Anna gets locked in a room to die and this snow ball named Olaf saves her. 
user2: thats cool
user1: The sneaky guy Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid and only true love can save her. 
user2: like a true love story
user1: Marshmallow was beaten. 
user1: Kristoff and Olaf saved the day.
user2: cool
user1: Anna's hair turned white and she was taken to Kristof's adoptive family of rock trolls.
user2: scary
user1: It turns out that the guy Anna thought she loved was a bad dude who was trying to off her and her sister and seize the throne for himself. 
user2: seems like a really bad dude
user1: Indeed. When he locked Anna up, he told everyone that Elsa killed Anna. He ordered her execution, but then discovered she had escaped. 
user2: darn
user2: so what happens in the end
user1: That would be nice to know. I'm afraid I don't have that information at this point.
user2: ok
user1: Did I mention that Kristoff was raised by a family of rocks. 
user2: no
user1: Not sure about what to do here...?
user2: I think go to the next document

user2: apparently it is popular with kids
user2: so I've heard

user2: yes. that's a  solid list of characters
user1: It's got the tag of being the best Disney animated feature since Beauty and the Beast
user2: sounds like its interesting
user2: that too
user1: Cast and script look water tight too
user1: I bet the kids loved the 3D aspect of the movie
user2: definitely
user2: what else do you know about it?
user1: It says it was inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, "The Snow Queen"
user2: oh cool

user2: Oh, I know it's very popular, but I couldn't remember what it was about
user1: It's based on a fairy tale called "The Snow Queen".
user2: oh, so it's based on a book, I didn't know that
user1: Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, I guess.
user2: Does it take place in the North , where it snows all the time
user1: Hm. I'm not sure it says where it takes place. It's called Frozen because Elsa has icy powers.
user2: oh ok, so she can freeze people
user2: Its so popular I should go see it
user1: She accidentally traps the kingdom in eternal winter. It's worth seeing at least once just so you know what it's all about.
user2: ok thank you for the information
user1: You're welcome. Hope you get to see it some time.
user2: I am going to try .
user2: Maybe they'll come out with a part two

conversation:
user1: Hi there
user2: HI, have you seen frozen?
user1: No, is it good?
user2: yes, it's prettygood, an animated comedy
user1: what is the setup? like what's it about?
user2: based on the fairy tale "snow queen", an ice princess goes on a journey to find her sister
user1: oh cool, i'm not really that into animated movies but it sounds nice. it's a musical, right?
user2: it is one of disneys best animated musicals
user1: cool. i know it was very popular with kids. i guess i'm supposed to end the conversation now?
user2: Yeah, lol, it won't let me end it, I think we have to have six dialogues each? I'm not sure
user2: Frozen made Kristen Bell very popular, little girls everywhere sing the theme song
user1: oh sorry i got confused, i thought it said three. Haha. Ohhhhh it was Kristen Bell! I knew the theme song was very popular but i didn't know who else was in it. Anybody else famous?
user1: Oh oops three each. Got it. I'll close now :)
user1: Wait it's saying I can't end it yet. Never mind.
user2: lol, it has Livy Strubenrauch, Agatha Lee Monn and Idina Menzel
user2: They say it's destined to become a broadway show based on it's popularity. (First mturk chat for me)
user1: Interesting. Well, I'm not that into animated movies or musicals but maybe if I have to take a kid to a movie I can see it.
user2: Definitely more of a childrens movie. But gets great viewer perception all around. 
user2: It is one of Disneys best animated musicals since the death of  the great lyricist Howard Ashman who did the little mermaid and beauty and the beast.
user1: It keeps saying if I end the conversation while the other user is still in it and acting normally, i won't get compensation. :O
user2: Ugh, it won't let me click finish either. 
user2: The finish conversation tab has a red circle with a line. I must've misunderstood the instructions

user1: Thanks again
user2: Geeze tyes lets finish

conversation:
user2: hey
user1: HI
user1: Hello

conversation:
user2: I didn't know Frozen scored so high on rotten tomatoes.
user2: I was kind of surprised by that.
user1: I don't doubt it actually! So many kids and adults alike were huge fans of the songs! I liked the movie because it was a great musical 
user1: I liked the premise of the story and how Elsa's icy powers and conquering her fear were such a big part of the movie
user2: Yeah it did have pretty catchy songs. I didn't like the movie as I thought I would because I saw it later on after hearing about how amazing it was, I guess it didn't live up to the hype.
user1: Yeah, I can see how the critical responses being so positive and everyone rating it so highly would make it seem overhyped. 
user1: Are you generally a fan of Disney movies?
user2: Yeah, but I didn't think it was bad. It was a nice movie to see. 
user1: Is there any particular critical response you absolutely agree with?
user2: Yeah, I like disney movies, especially the ones I grew up watching. I would watch Toy Story about 3 times a day at one point.
user2: This one: "You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become whilewatching Disney's 3D animated princess tale."
user1: Omg! Toy story is an amazing and classic Disney movie! Do you think Frozen matches the "comedy, animation, and adventure?" genre?
user2: The entire time I was watching it, I thought it'd be a really great musical, especially for the holidays.
user1: It really is. I definitely think Elsa accidentally injuring Anna was a key scene. I think if I was in her place, I'd be insecure using my powers as well. 
user2: Definitely, it had all of those elements and worked really well.
user1: I wonder if the trolls scene was at all frightening for children
user2: I agree, it definitely was. I'd be pretty insecure too. The scene also created depth for the characters and made you care about them. It was hard not to sympathize with the guilt Elsa felt.
user1: But it also made you feel the sadness that Anna had because she was isolated from her sister forcefully, and had no explanation for it, 
user2: Yeah, which is a really sad situation for both of them. 
user1: Agreed. I think the love scenes between Anna and Hans were funny and seemed too good to be true. 
user2: Yeah, that's a good point. I wonder if children felt that as well.
user1: I can understand why Elsa would object and get mad enough to unleash a icy storm
user2: Yeah, me too. It was nice, it showed she still cared about her sister, but I don't think Anna saw it that way in the beginning.
user1: Yeah, but it might have caught her by surprise considering her sister and her had not talked for much of her life. 
user2: I would probably be surprised too honestly, especially after all those years of not knowing what was going on.
user1: I think it was incredibly well thought out. I think the Hans aspect was an amazing plot twist that many people would not have seen coming 
user1: I also think Olaf deserved a lot of credit in this movie for being a great comic relief 
user2: I had some suspicion about Hands throughout the movie, but it was sad to see how it played out.
user2: Ahaha, Olaf was the star of the show at a lot of times.
user1: Oh! Smart cookie you are! And I absolutely agree he was. Without him and Kristoff, there would not have been an amazing movie!
user1: Also I think we're allowed to finish conversation now
user1: It was a pleasure talking to you!
user1: Thanks for your wonderful insight :)

conversation:
user2: Hello, can you tell me about the movie?
user2: Are you there?
user1: Sorry about that!
user2: no worries!
user2: so can you tell me a little about the movie?
user1: So it's a comedy, kids movie, and it's animated
user2: oh, sounds good!  is it one adults can enjoy, too?
user1: Kids love it a lot, it's got Kristen Bell as one of the main characters
user2: what is it called?
user1: Yeah, I guess adults like it! It's called Frozen
user2: oh I would love to see that!  I've heard it's great
user2: so it has a great cast?
user1: Yeah it's pretty great the first time, I would hate to be a parent having to hear my kids watch it all the time though.
user2: oh yeah well hopefully mine are too young to parrot back parts of it
user1: Yeah it's got Kristen Bell as Anna, Idina Menzel as Elsa, and Jonathan Gross as Kristoff
user2: ok well the cast always helps
user1: It's a Disney movie so they found really good vocalists and actors to do the movie
user2: that's true, Disney usually does a good job with their films
user1: Critics say that it was the animated musical to come out since the Little Mermaid
user2: wow, really?  I sure did notice it getting a lot of acclaim
user1: It came out in 2013, wow I didn't realize it was already that old! Half a decade!
user2: yeah I didn't either.  yikes
user2: how do we know when to stop here or what?
user2: I"m a bit unclear.
user1: 12 chat lines for each of us.
user2: ohh, okay.  are there several other movies?
user1: Anyways it got an 89% on rotten tomatos and a CinemaScore of A+
user2: my oldest daughter keeps mentioning wanting to watch it
user2: I feel like rotten tomatos is usually pretty accurate
user1: You should get it for her! I'm sure she would love it. It's a very classic style Disney tale but with all the modern trimmings
user2: I think that I will.  I just haven't decided if my husband and I would like it too b ut I guess we could try.  her little sister will love it too I'm sure althouogh she won't follow the plot
user1: One critic said "Frozen is both a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation of Disney coming to terms with its own legacy and identity"
user2: wow, that's deep
user2: well I believe I will put it on our list to watch, or perhaps get it at Redbox.  maybe it's on Netflix if it's that old.
user1: Yeah it's also the 53rd Disney animated film. and it's based off a fairy tale called "The Snow Queen"
user2: oh, I've heard of that fairy tale.  cool, we will lookk that up
user1: Anyways, it was great talking with you! Have a great day!
user2: hard to believe there are so many Disney m ovies
user2: you too!!

conversation:
user1: Hi, Do you know the name of the movie?
user2: Hi! The movie is Frozen. Have you seen it?
user1: No i havent but i have heard good things.
user2: Yes, it actually got a A+ CinemaScore and 89% on Rotten Tomatoes which is awesome. 
user1: That is pretty good! Have you seen it yourself?
user2: I have several times. It has a princess on a journey so it's comedy and adventure. 
user1: The animation looks beautiful.
user2: Yep! One critic said it was the best animated musical to come from Disney in a long time.
user1: i love adventure themed movies. 
user1: the characters seem well developed
user2: The characters are great and include a princess, a iceman, a reindeer, and a snowman. You should definitely check it out!
user2: Also a colony of trolls!
user1: I heard the snowman is suppose to be funny and has a good voice actor.
user1:  i love trolls
user2: And the princess has cryokinetic magic which is awesome. I'm not sure who the actor is for the snowman, but the princesses have Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel who are both great. 
user1: Oh ive heard good things about them! Did you like the soundtrack?
user2: I do. The songs are broadway-style and one critic said it was destined to end up on Broadway
user2: The main plot is where Elsa the princess accidentally unleashes an eternal winter on her town and then runs away. So they have to go find her. 
user1: I'm very convinced to watch it now. It seems like the movie has been very inspiring for children.
user2: Great for children and also just families in general. You should definitely check it out. Especially since you like trolls. :)
user1:  I heard they might be coming out with a second one because the first was such a great success.
user2: Oh very cool! I hadn't heard that, but with the great reviews from the first one that wouldn't surprise me. The critics just raved about it. 
user1: Im a big fan of nordic themed stuff so the fact they made a disney movie with the theme is very exciting! The dress designs looked fantastic!
user2: I think my favorite part is the giant snow creature named Marshmallow who chases everyone away. Princess Anna accidentally gets her heart frozen. That's where the trolls come in. 
user1: Oh that sounds very action packed! I hope i can see it soon. Did you have a favorite scene?
user2: Anything with the trolls. :)
user1: I heard there are plenty of plot twists that surprised people
user2: Yes, one in particular about someone trying to steal the throne, but I won't ruin it for you. 
user1: I wish more disney movies would be as bold to add plot twists like that.
user2: Yes. It sounds like you would really like it. 
user1: Thank you so much for sharing :)

user1: sp
user1: What was yours?
user2: The scene when they are girls and they are siging through the door.
user1: Yea. A lot more adult humor

user2: I cant believe it was the 53rd movie from Disney. 
user1: Wow I didn't know that
user1: Is that on the sheet?
user2: Yes, on the second sheet.
user2: I didn't know the name of the snow creature was marshmallow.
user1: I didn't either?
user1: I was sure it was something else
user2: I didn't know it had a name.
user1: O, For a second I thought you were talking about the little snow man
user1: that Anna hangs out with
user2: no the big monster.
user1: You still there?

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: So you've never seen Frozen?
user2: I think I saw part of it but got bored and shut it off
user1: You missed some great animation.  How far did you get in it?
user2: I think only a few minutes
user2: why did you like it?
user1: Absolutely.  It was one of the better Disney movies in a while.
user2: better than Aladdin or the Lion King? I really liked Mulan
user1: I think so.  Many would disagree, but the songs are better in Frozen.
user2: You liked it for the songs?
user2: or the story?
user1: Both really.  I have to admit the songs got tired after hearing them all the time.
user2: what is the plot?
user1: Basically, a princess named Elsa has powers that allow her to create magic.  After her parents die, her sister Anna goes to look for her
user2: Elsa runs away?
user1: Right, she basically runs away and creates a castle in the mountains.
user2: She builds it from magic?
user1: Yep, she basically can create frost and wind and anything cold with her fingertips.
user2: Is it more for kids or grown ups?
user1: Both, but kids will likely love it more.
user2: How long is it?
user1: Around 90 minutes, not too bad.
user2: Is is computer animated? I forgot..I like the older cartoon animations
user1: Yep, 100% computer animated, not hand-drawn.
user2: Would you say it is better than LIon King or Mulan?
user1: Lion King for sure.  I didn't care for Mulan.
user2: Is there comedy in it?
user1: Oh yeah, not dirty at all, but many patches throughout.
user2: Are there any male figures in it or is it like a girl power movie?
user1: There are some male figures.  The best male character is Kristoff who ends up being a love interest in the movie.
user2: How old is Elsa and Anna?

conversation:
user1: Kristen Bell played the role of Anna in Frozen
user2: Its a 53rd DC animated film
user1: You can see the broadway musical Frozen is destined to become
user2: The pet of icemen is reindeer
user1: It's a terrific bit of family entertainment
user2: The plot of the movie is good and touching our hearts at the end
user1: I agree it's the best animated musical to come out of Disney
user2: It has a good ratting in rotten tomatoes
user2: A good metacritic score
user1: Idina Menzel was terrific as Elsa
user1: What did you think of the colony of Trolls?
user2: He heals anna
user1: It's unfortunate it causes Elsa to suppress her magic rather than mastering it. 
user2: Did you watched the movie. The animation is very good I liked the icemen character
user2: We can talk about the movie and document in general
user1: Yes, Kristoff was a great character. Jonathan Groff was a surprise since he was unknown
user2: Prince Hans character is a moderate twist in the climax if the story
user1: I felt bad for Elsa when the Duke branded her a monster. 
user2: Yeah that's where the adventure part of the story begins and we are seeing more interesting characters in the movie
user1: The palace of ice she creates is really cool
user2: Yeah and The living  ice character with carrot nose was funny
user1: Do you generally like animation movies?
user2: Yes. They added a new paragraph
user1: Yes. I thought it was an interesting twist that Kristoff was raised by the Trolls
user2: When Anna meets Elsa in the palace she gets angry and freezes Anna's heart 
user1: And Hans turns out not to be her true love and unable to heal her heart. Very shocking
user2: Elsa could have rescued Anna before she flee 
user1: Sure, but Hans makes it look like Elsa killed her
user2: The marshmallow is really animated cool and fits to scene very well
user1: The fight between Elsa, Marshmellow and Hans was pretty neat
user2: I am waiting for the 4th paragraph
user1: Did you enjoy the musical score?
user2: Yeah it was very pleasant

conversation:

user2: Sounds like an interesting movie what genre is it

user2: Yes OK it's a Disney movie.  Who is the bag guy in the movie?
user2: Bad guy
user2: Also where does the film take place?
user1: Technically its the heros estranged sister. Her icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. I believe the siters name is Anna
user2: OK is there any side kicks in this movie?
user1: The film takes place in a kingdom that is experiencing an eternal winter.
user2: I see that sounds like it can be pretty daunting.  As I don't like Winter haha
user1: The side kicks are Krisktoff an iceman who is accompanied by a reindeer named sven.
user2: Why does she have powers?
user1: I believe she was born with the powers

user2: Hello did you see the Disney movie Frozen which was created in 2013? 
user1: I did! I love that it was inspired by Andersen's "The Snow Queen". 

conversation:
user2: HI
user2: HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
user1: sup
user1: Hello
user1: Great movie
user2: YES
user2: GREAT MOVIE
user2: CLIMAX IS AWSOME

conversation:
user2: Hi! This sounds like a very interesting movie! What do you think?
user2: Hi are you there?
user1: It is good! It scored well with critics too
user1: I really like Kristen Bell and think she did great in this role! I thought she was the singer
user2: I love movies about fearless princesses. It really shows true girl power and teaches young girls they can accomplish anything!
user1: It also helped Disney to build its modern animation department! They haven't had a hit like it since Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast
user2: This would make a great Broadway musical considering how well the music is styled
user1: Yeah! Did you know it was based of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen" ?
user2: That's so awesome! And the directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee really did a great job bringing it to life!
user1: Can't believe its already been out for 5 years! 
user1: l always get Ana and Elsa confused. Anna is the younger sister and Elsa is the Queen
user1: are you there?
user2: Can you believe Elsa became queen at the age of 21?
user1: Thats so young! 
user1: I was so sad for the girls when they were separated at such a young age from Elsa's accidental magic.
user2: It's so sad that the girls were isolated to the castle because of Elsa's ice powers
user1: Luckily Anna didn't remember
user2: And so sad that their parents died at sea because of a storm.
user1: Luckily they were there to take them to the trolls to save them before they left though!
user2: Yes! Can you imagine how scary it was to realize your sister had ice powers, and she was the reason for the eternal winter in the kingdom?
user1: Elsa's cycokinetic magic was fun for them to play with though before.
user2: That's true. What did you think about Anna falling in love with Prince Hans?
user1: I was concerned when they quickly decided to get married and thought ELsa was right to object
user2: Oh definitely! I completely agree! It didn't help that the two sisters were already distant.
user1: They may had been alright had Elsa not accidentally revealed her powers when she objected
user2: I hate that the Duke called her a monster. If only he knew the whole story!
user1: I know that Elsa didn't mean to freeze Anna's heart but Elsa really needs to learn to control her anger!
user1: I couldn't believe it when they show that Hans has been evil this whole time!
user2: And how cruel of Hans to have used Anna like that! At least he showed his true colors before it was too late
user1: And luckily Elsa gets away!
user2: Hans was the real monster in this story. 
user1: Yes he was and I liked Kristoff better anyways! 
user2: Oh yes!
user1: He saved Anna so many times!
user2: They were truly meant for each other! I really liked how the story turned and took us all by surprise that Hans was not the one for Anna!
user1: He was only interested in the throne!
user2: The "act of true love" took me by surprise too! I thought for sure it would be a kiss from Hans until he turned out to be evil.
user1: I loved how the act of true love wasn't just a kiss like other movies!
user1: Though i was surprised too
user2: Yes that really set this movie apart!
user1: It sure did!
user2: Do you typically watch animated movies like this?
user1: Yes i love animation
user1: I was afraid Anna would freeze solid before the act of true love!

conversation:
user2: Hi! Hope you can tell me some interesting tips.
user1: the movie is disney's frozen.
user2: cool. What's it about?
user1: its an adaptation of hans christian anderson's the snow queen
user2: What's the main character's name?
user1: elsa
user2: So, I guess it's full of Ice and Snow huh
user1: shes a princess looking to find her estranged sister
user2: how did they become estranged?
user1: not sure, but the sister is somehow responsible for elsa's kingdom being trapped in eternal winter
user2: So, maybe she's an evil sister?
user1: no, elsa's uncontrolled magic injured her sister when they were young and their parents eventually separated them
user2: Oh, for their own safety?
user1: yes
user2: Well, her parent's don't know where the sister is?
user1: their parents died when they were teenagers 
user2: oh, ok. does she have help to find her?
user1: yes, a rugged iceman and his pet reindeer
user2: Is there an evil character?
user1: yes, the duke of weselton
user2: Why?
user1: he outs elsa as having dangerous magical powers
user2: well, hope she finds her?
user2: i bet she does
user1: its a bit complicated after elsa finds her sister

user2: Hello
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user1: Hello, we are discussing the movie, Frozen.
user1: Have you received the document?
user2: No
user2: But I have seen the movie.
user1: I have seen the movie as well. It is very charming.
user2: Yes I really the love the characters, the storyline and music.
user1: Did you know that Kristen Bell provided the voice for Anna, Elsa's sister?
user2: Oh really. That is neat.
user2: Did she sing the songs too?
user1: I haven't seen any of her other film's, but I have seen a few interviews. She's pretty funny. 
user1: I think she did, but I'm not certain. 
user2: That is fun to see the interviews too.
user2: The snowman has quite a personality.
user1: Yes! Olaf is funny. It was great that the creators of the story offered a good bit of humor since it really is a sad story.
user1: And thinking of Olaf being a snowman and all, I have "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" stuck in my head. haha
user2: Olaf added alot to the story.
user1: He really did!
user2: It was interesting twist to make the prince the bad guy.
user1: It was a creative twist from Disney for sure! Not that we could have know how Elsa would have responded to Hans' proposal to Anna, but really, you could probably back up and blame the whole fiasco on Hans.
user2: Yeah. I really loved Hans sidekick the reindeer too.
user2: They worked together well as a team with Anna.
user1: But truly, it could be argued that Elsa may have never really learned to grasp her powers if she hadn't lost control.
user1: Kristoff has the reindeer :)
user2: Oh yeah sorry.
user2: I agree about her powers.
user2: They really had a lot of real life meaning in the plot. 
user1: I love how the film displays the unrelenting love of a sister. 
user1: They really did.
user2: Yes me too. It is
user2: It is a true love between sisters.
user2: I hope they come out with a sequel.
user1: I think seeing Anna risk her own life to attempt to get Elsa to see that she has meaning and is loved is something we can all look to. 
user1: That would be awesome!
user1: I think there is a lot of real life lessons we could learn from this movie. 
user2: I agree. That is what I believe a lot of movies should have that in their story line. With a true message you learned from. A new perspective in life.
user1: I think it also teaches not to look too much at the outside: mainly from the perspective of Hans & Kristoff. One has all the credentials & the other is a blue collar worker.
user2: Yes very true.
user1: I don't want to stereotype people in authority roles, but it shows just how easily those powers can be abused. 
user2: I agree with you there.
user2: Hans let his being a prince go to his head for sure.
user1: Absolutely!
user2: I like how it was the sister love of Elsa helped Ann not be frozen anymore. They could of easily made it be Kristoff but they gave that special ability to Elsa.
user1: Hans had a 'good' plan for taking over the thrown: locking Anna away to "freeze" and then blaming it on her sister.
user2: Yeah luckily it did not work.
user2: It was cool Ann gave Kristoff a new sleigh too in the end.
user1: Very lucky. When I was a teenager, my mom used to have this saying that got under my skin as we were not a religious family, but she'd tell  me, "Your sins will find you out!" I'm glad this came true for Hans! HAHA!
user1: She was royalty, it was only right that she replace what was destroyed in the process of trying to retrieve her sister.
user1: Did Kristoff make his sleigh? The one in the beginning?
user2: That is a great saying for Hans. I guess he did not have anyone to teach him that at a young age.
user2: I am not sure but it did go over a cliff. Ann gave him a new one in the end.
user1: Right. 
user1: So, do you generally like these kinds of movies?
user2: I love them very much. My favorite.
user2: How about you?
user1: I'm typically an action/adventure type person, but I love movies with happy endings. I'm not a tragedy person.
user2: You are fun to talk to about movies.
user2: I like action adventure too. But I always like a movie with a lot of meaning with it.
user1: Thanks! Life can be hard, movies can be an escape. lol. I don't typically listen too much to critics about films. I'm with you, I like something with meaning behind it. How do you feel about movie ratings/critics?
user2: Well mostly I go by with it some. Alot of people have different perspective of what they like. What others like others might dislike. 
user1: Agreed. This one got some generally good reviews. The lowest score it received was my Metacritics: 74/100. Not really sure what they based their rating on, but that seems kind of low to me
user2: I agree. I love sequel to movies alot. And other times I will start to watch to see if I like it or not.
user2: I love all Disney movies.
user1: Yes! I think we are in a time where we just LOVE stories with a lot of depth.
user1: I'm a Disney fan as well.
user2: Yeah I really love a stories with depth. Great word for that. I always look for that in the story line whenever I am watching it. And always looking for the depth in the storyline of all movies.

user2: ok
user1: thank you

conversation:
user1: So today we get to chat about Frozen
user1: Have you seen the movie before?
user2: I don't have the paragraph on my end.
user2: I have seen the movie.
user2: have you seen it?
user1: I have seen it and due to my nieces and nephews I have seen it at least a dozen times.
user2: Myself also, many times.
user2: Do you like it?
user1: I did enjoy it, and it really did well among critics some claiming that it was the best musical to come out since The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
user1: Did you like it and thought it lived up to the hype?
user2: I thought it was a good movie, I liked that it wasn't a typical Disney show.
user1: Yes, it was neat for them to base it on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale but give some twists to boot.
user1: I think it also set the stage for Disney to redefine itself in this genre.
user2: Exactly, and it opened doors for other new shows.
user2: You typed it faster than me.
user1: No worries, I am mostly using the source material on this end. Makes it easier.
user1: Speaking of which, what did you think of the colony of trolls? I thought it was one of the stranger aspects that didn't necessarily add that much to the movie.
user2: The trolls I believe were used for comedic relief. 
user2: They weren't really a necessarily big part of the movie, except to explain Hans back ground.
user1: I can see that, and I guess it also showed what lengths the family would go through to ensure that Anna was healed after Elsa accidentally injures her.
user1: I found it interesting as well that her parents reaction was to lock her up until her coronation.
user2: It also shows that it was going to create a rift or some sort of internal battle
user1: Exactly, and I think is interesting to think about how parents react to kids talents sometimes suppressing them when they should encourage mastery.
user2: They both end up being shut off from the world, just in different styles.
user1: And I think that is the common bond for them to that shines in the sister sister bond
user1: And why Elsa reacts so strongly to Hans proposing to Anna to create that eternal winter for the kingdom
user2: Some parents don't know how to react to something that is different from the norm. What is typically expected.
user2: I think Elsa was only trying to protect Anna, but it shows that anger can't be controlled. Anger needs to be balanced and dealt with.
user1: Exactly, especially as she ended up freezing Anna's heart.
user1: This then was the catalyst to reveal the true nature of Hans as usurper to the throne.
user2: I believe that was all a journey in learning a lesson.
user2: Yea I knew from the beginning Hans was dirty. But thats how you learn by mistakes.
user1: And I think that was an important step for Disney as well
user2: Yes it was, Disney was getting boring with the same ole story just different characters
user1: It seems our conversation has run come to a close on my end. Thank you for conversing with me. Have a pleasant day, afternoon or night depending where you are in the world.
user2: You too, I enjoyed it as well.

conversation:
user2: hi there!
user1: Hello, have you ever watched the animated movie Frozen?
user2: Yes, I loved the musical especially in 3D.
user1: Did you know that it the 53rd animated feature made by Disney?  Hard to believe Disney has made that many movies!
user2: It is... I heard it was inspired by one of Hans Christian Andersen tales.
user1: Yes, a book called the Snow Queen.  
user1: Did you think any parts of the movie dragged along?
user2: It's a shame Frozen received a high rotten Tomato score. some parts did drag on but the music help to make it bearable.
user2: Do you like animated films?
user1: It was a low a score but I try to not judge a movie on that.  Not everyone has the same taste in film.  Plus it couldnt be all that bad considering it has been several years since the movie released and it is a major hit with families.
user1: I do.  And Frozen is one of my favorites. 
user1: I wish they had done better with Olafs musical number, it was lacking compared to the rest.
user1: Frozen is also a Broadway musical
user2: You are right others opinions but rotten tomatoes at  89%? 
user1: I dont think that is all that low for a movie.
user2: Frozen is a favorite of mine also. I love the concept of a Princess going out to fight for her sisters, classic.
user1: Yes, I am glad to see Disney starting to portray strong female charactors!
user2: The Broadway musical is like the 3D version on steroids. I heard that it's also a wonderful play.
user1: I have heard that too.  I would like to see it.  
user1: I heard same about shrek and was not impress with the Broadway musical verison
user1: Hopefully this will rank up there with the Lion King
user2: Frozen is so emotional every time I hear a soundtrack from the film I get all teary-eyed.
user2: I actually think Frozen is right up there with the Lion King.
user2: I think Frozen was the best film released in 2013. What do you think?
user1: Oh yes.  
user1: It has made on impact
user2: Yes on every child.
user1: Every little girl i knows love it.
user2: Did you see it in 3D?
user1: I have not yet, but want to
user2: Did you think the plot was great?
user1: Yes the story and plot are great! 
user2: One critic said it was "a great big snowy pleasure".
user2: It's crazy but at times it reminded me of a modern-day Wizard of Oz movie.

conversation:
user1: I liked the animation of this movie. I thought that the snow was beautiful.
user2: Oh, absolutely! The graphics were insane!
user1: I didn't know that it was inspired by another story. I thought that it was original.
user2: I had no idea either! I never heard of The Snow Queen. That's interesting.
user1: Me, neither. I may seek it out to read it.
user1: I wonder why it only scored a 89% on Rotten Tomoatoes?
user1: I'd never heard anything bad about it.
user2: I do have to agree with the one review that says that it is the best Disney musical since Ashmans passing.
user1: Do you generally like cartoon musicals?
user2: I agree! An 89 is pretty good for Rotten Tomatoes but that is definitely lower than expected. 
user2: I do! I am a sucker for a good Disney classic 
user1: Me, too. I've also got a 5 year old, so I get to watch them a lot.
user2: Do you think Frozen will eventually be on Broadway in NYC???
user1: You'd have to check online, but I think that I've heard it's a possibility.
user2: It might be hard to bring to life... but it was such a hit movie.
user1: I really liked the music. That would be hard to replicate in a live show, too.
user2: Oh, Definitely!
user2: Idina Menzel would have to play Else.
user2: There is just not other way around it.
user1: Yeah. She would be tough to replace.
user1: The summary that point number one gives is a little weird. I never thought that the parents separated the girls.
user1: I thought that Elsa separated herself.
user2: I like that Elsas powers are referred to as "cyokinetic magic" in this page. That sounds so cool. Ha!
user1: Haha. I just noticed that too. THat's not something I'd ever heard of before.
user1: I also liked the voice of Olaf. He's been great in some of the other Frozen storeis, too.
user2: Hm... yeah... I definitely agree with your point above! She definitely separated herself. Or did I miss something?
user1: Ha - I also didn't realize that the snow creatre's name was Marshmallow.
user2: His voice is honestly perfect for Olafs character. It's so cute and goofy.
user2: Lol! I love that! 
user2: I knew Kristoff was villainous from the beginning, but he was so evil in the end!
user1: I did like the scence where Hans laid out his plans for Anna. My wife audibly gasped when he did that.
user1: Why did you think Kristoff was vilanous? I thought he was a good guy?
user2: Oh, I am so sorry. I meant Hans!
user1: THere are a lot of characters to keep track of. :)
user2: But Yes - Anna and Hans song in the very beginning was very fun and catchy!
user1: yes. I really liked that... especially the part about finishing each other's sandwiches.
user2: That's what I was gonna say!
user2: :)
user1: ha
user1: I can't beleive that it came out in 2013. 5 years! geez.
user1: It seems to me that it was much shorter than that.
user2: That does not seem right does It? I know it is... but wow.

conversation:
user1: Have you seen this movie?
user2: hello
user2: which one
user1: Frozen
user2: yes
user2: i like that 
user1: Do you have a favorite character?
user2: when it was released?
user1: 2013
user2: yes 
user1: Which one is it?
user2: Anna (Kristen Bell) my favourite
user2: what is yours?
user1: I am an Olaf fan
user2: who was the director
user1: I am not sure
user2:  Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck i think that people
user1: What are your thoughts about the song, Let it go
user2: i like it
user2: Frozen" is the world's 10th-highest-grossing film of all time
user2: 3D computer-animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation 
user2: what is your favourite ceine 
user1: Hmmm probably when Elsa builds her castle
user1: Its just so amazing to see it transform like that
user1: Disney does cgi animation better than just about anyone.
user2: yes i agree
user1: I find it interesting that it actually was a story before that they just transformed and rewrote
user2: Frozen raises an ambitious, perhaps foolhardy comparison. Does Disney dare herald a subzero Lion King
user1: I have heard this before but I am not sure
user1: I actually am not a huge lion king fan for some reason
user2: Frozen is then, perhaps, family entertainment for a new generation. 
user1: My kids like it so much that we bought it. I have seen it thousands of times I think
user2: Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), and break her icy spell. Although their epic journey leads them to encounters
user1: Indeed. I think the way its revealed is amazing
user1: To see the reaction of everyone about her powers and that they aren't only evil but can actualy be used for good is a great lesson
user2: yes i know
user2: how was you experience?

conversation:
user2: I really enjoyed the musical numbers in this movie. How about you?
user1: Yes, I would love to see it as a Broadway Musical!
user2: I bet that would be amazing!
user1: Generally, do you like Disney's 3D animated movies?
user2: I do. They have done a really good job making entertaining and relevant movies lately.
user1: They sure have. Disney will always make movies that will become classics for the future. 
user2: I love the comedic elements that get thrown in as well.
user1: Definitely, and great for the whole family to watch together.
user1: I didn't know that Frozen was based on Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen"
user2: It is interesting how they can take an old fairy tale and turn it into a movie. I wonder if there was a talking snowman in the original?
user2: It is unfortunate that the parents chose to cover up Elsa's magic rather than just help her learn to use it safely.
user1: Yes it is. It is sad that the parents of Elsa and Anna die at sea during a storm.
user1: The King and Queen should have encouraged Anna and Elsa to find common ground and get along as they were isolated in the castle.
user2: I imagine they were driven by their fear of what the people would think of it.
user1: I don't think Elsa meant to hurt Anna with her magic.
user2: I agree. She lost control when she grew anxious.
user1: If only the parents educated Elsa about her magic instead of leaving her to become so insecure about it.
user2: If they had, then I don't think there would be a plot for the movie!
user2: I was totally surprised that Hans ended up being a bad guy.
user1: I don't agree that Elsa is a monster as the Duke portrays her. 
user2: Elsa's ice castle was super cool, though.
user1: Yes, the palace she created for herself was stunning.
user2: I didn't realize the snow monster had a name. 
user1: I didn't know that either, but I like his name "Marshmallow".
user1: I'm so happy that Elsa could escape from her cell.
user1: And I do like Olaf, he is so cute!
user2: His character made the movie, for sure!
user1: I agree! 
user1: Hans is such a villain in this movie! I couldn't believe it either!
user2: Agreed! I wish Anna had been able to punch him when he revealed his true nature.
user1: Right? Her poor heart....
user1: And trying to execute Elsa, I never saw any of this coming in the beginning.
user2: I wonder why none of their people questioned Hans's motivations.
user1: He was too smooth for people to notice.
user2: I believe that is the definition of a sociopath.
user1: Definitely.
user2: The sisters were very fortunate to have Kristoff helping them. Who would have known a complete stranger would become such an important person to them?
user1: Agreed. I felt bad for both Anna and Elsa.
user2: At least they ended up being faithful to one another.
user1: Yes, that is very important.
user2: Once again, if only they had been closer growing up they might have avoided a lot of trouble.
user1: Yes, as it would be in real life as well.
user1: It was very nice chatting with you about Frozen. 
user2: You too!

conversation:
user1: I haven't seen this movie, but my daughter liked it.
user2: What movie is it ?  I haven't seen many movies in the theaters lately.
user1: My daughter likes to keep seeing it on TV
user2: What network is it on ?  I see Harry Potter played often on repeat.  
user1: It's been a long time since it was in the theatres
user1: I think it comes on Disney and some other channels
user1: I think she has some Frozen toys
user2: I've only seen parts of the movie frozen, but you couldn't really miss the merchandising. 
user1: Will there be a sequel to Frozen?
user1: Yeah, all things are merchandized these days.
user2: I think there will be a sequal to frozen, but I haven't seen that movie.  The movie Ice Age is like frozen
user2: And there are many Ice Age sequels. 
user1: I think I've heard of that, but don't know much about it.
user2: So was the movie you were thinking Ice Age or something else ?
user1: Really? How many Ice Age movies have there been?
user1: It's a bit hard to say. I don't think I know very much about Ice Age movies.
user2: I think there were at least 4 with the one that is about to come out, they all have varying names.  
user2: Maybe it was a movie with a disney princess 
user1: Wow. I didn't know that.
user1: Do you like these movies?
user2: Not really !  I like Harry Potter over those movies.  
user1: I think my daughter has seen a few movies like that, but I don't really watch them.
user2: A Wrinkle In Time seems like a good movie that will be coming out soon.  A fantasy story.  Was the movie you were thinking about a sci fi fantasy?
user1: I have only seen parts of a couple of Harry Potter movies.
user1: Not sure. But I have seen previews of A Wrinkle In Time. Looks like it might be ineteresting.
user2: Do you know the lead actor in the movie you were thinking about ?  There are a lot of female leads lately.
user1: I mostly like Action/Adventure movies. Sometimes dramas. I like comdeies, but most of them are dumb.
user1: I don't keep much track of actors lately.
user2: Was the movie animated or a regular movie, that your daughter liked ?
user1: Movies are expensive to go to these days.
user2: Very expensive.  And it's so easy to stream whatever you want from home.  
user1: I don't think I've gone to a theatre in 18 months.
user1: Yes you can stream very easily.
user2: Moana is another movie that was really popular, a disney movie I believe.
user2: Except I don't think it's on tv yet, but maybe. 

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hey there! Have you watched this animated, comedy movie?

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Have you seen the movie Frozen? It was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen"
user2: hi
user2: how are you today
user1: I am good
user2: yes
user2: i love that
user1: Me too :)
user2: what about you
user2: what you like about the movie
user1: I really enjoy the sister bond in the movie and how they begin estranged, and work out their problems through this adventure
user2: yes i also like When their kingdom becomes trapped in perpetual winter, fearless Anna (Kristen Bell) joins forces with mountaineer Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer sidekick to find Anna's sister, Snow Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel), and break her icy spell. Although their epic journey leads them to encounters 
user1: I also really enjoyed the reindeer name Sven
user2: the animation the graphics also cool
user2: All the charcter also cool
user1: It scored 89% on rotten tomatoes
user1: I would actually expect that score to be higher
user2: Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures
user1: Do you like Anna or Elsa better?
user2: yes
user1: I cannot believe this is Disneys 53rd animated feature film
user2: winter lady
user1: I have been watching Disney movies since I was young
user2: so what you then believe?
user1: They classified this as a comedy and adventure. But there is so much more to it.
user2: i agree
user1: I thought it was really sad in the beginning when Elsa injured Anna with her magic, and her parents told her to hide it
user1: That had to be terrifying for a young girl
user2: yes it need to be for good starting
user1: I also felt bad for Elsa in the scene where her magic comes out, but she was just trying to protect her sister. That is why she was saying to back off, and that they couldn't get married. While it seemed as though she was trying to hurt her, she was actually trying to protect her
user2: Frozen" is the highest-grossing animated film of all time.
user1: that is actually believable. Everyone watched Frozen 
user1: I loved the little trolls too in the movie
user2: yes
user2: how was your experiece with me
user2: talking
user1: They were very cute, and I loved when they were talking about Anna and Kristoff getting together
user1: It was good. Thank you for chatting with me

conversation:
user1: hello
user2: Hi. How are you?
user1: I'm good.....how are you?
user1: Have you seen the popular movie Frozen
user2: Same here. I have seen the movie.
user1: Did you like the song? They were so popular!
user2: I liked it at first, but it became overplayed. It started to annoy me.
user1: Are you fond of musicals in general?
user2: I am actually. It usually depends on the type of musical it is.
user1: That one particular song, Let it go, especially was over played
user2: I agree completely. 
user1: For the longest time, I associated Kristen bell with only this movie
user2: Idena Menzel was who I associated it with.
user1: Oh, yeah, because of the song
user2: They were actually pretty well known before the movie, but had a different audience.
user1: It's amazing how much money they made on the merchandize
user2: It is still making money! Disney is milking it for all it's worth.
user1: True. I wonder if it will have a sequel
user2: I hope not. It will not be as good as the first.
user1: That is usually the case with most sequels. People expect a lot and then are disappointed
user2: Frozen had a few short films come out. They didn't receive well at all.
user1: Oh really, did know that
user1: The animation quality was good
user2: Yes it was. and each new movie keeps getting better.
user1: Was this a Pixar too?
user2: I don't think so. I think it was strictly Disney. 
user1: This movie was released in 2013, it seems like yesterday!
user2: It's been that long? Wow. I didn't even notice.
user1: I guess it was so popular that we felt like it was released only in 2017
user1: I just saw the info provided along with genre
user2: Moana kind of took it's place in recent years.
user1: Was it a hit too?
user2: Yes, very big. Great songs. Very funny. Not as Big as Frozen, but didn't really fade away as fast.

conversation:
user2: Hi, this movie is about Frozen the Disney movie right?
user1: Yes have you seen it?
user2: Yes I have. I think it lives up to the hype. How about you?
user1: yes, i did nto know that Howard Ashman worked on the movie though
user2: Neither did I. 
user1: they think there will be a Broadway musical about it, do you believe it will make it there?
user2: I hope it does. I mean isn't it one of Disney's most successful movies, correct me if I am wrong?
user1: I think it is, and I know my kids loved it 
user2: Yep me too and I am a grown man. No shame in that.
user2: Do you think they will make a Frozen 2?
user1: I hope they do just hard to think what it could be about though as they closed off all avenues 
user2: True
user1: which was your favorite charicter 
user1: character 
user2: Olaf
user2: The snowman guy
user2: How about you?
user1: haha mine was Sven 
user2: Oh haha he is a close second for me too
user1: Wow did you know Ana was sung by 4 different people 
user2: Nope I never knew. 
user1: When Ana is singing the wanna build a snow man song, they used 4 people ranging in ages for the song as shegrew up 
user2: Oh interesting.
user2: I think that is understandable as the singers wouldn't be able to alter their voices to sound younger/older, but its surprising to know because I never thought of that
user1: i hated Hans though wanted to punch him
user2: Haha
user2: Same it made something brew in me
user1: I didn't know the directors of frozen also did Rotten Tomatoes 
user2: What do you mean they did Rotten Tomatoes?
user1: He directed it 
user2: Wait he owns rotten tomatoes?
user1: ohh it's a production company i thought it was a movie 
user2: Oh haha
user2: Yeah its like IMBD
user2: A kind of Yelp for movies
user1: ahh i didn't know that 
user2: but for movie experts
user2: I could see a movie named Rotten Tomatoes though
user2: but I digress
user2: Wow I didn't know it was about 5 years since Frozen was released
user1: Yeah my youngest was just born, he's now 4 and a half  he was transfixed by the music 
user2: Let it gooooo
user2: Yeah it is a catchy song
user1: 3-month-old baby barely able to hold his head up and he's staring at the screen while Elsa is singing...lol 
user2: Haha that shows that it gets his attention
user2: I didn't know Frozen was inspired by another movie called The Snow Queen
user1: i think that my favorite scene was when Anna punched Hans in the face
user2: I don't quite remember that scene. I would have to revisit that scene again
user1: right at the end after Anna is freed from the ice 
user2: Oh yeah. 
user2: I relished it too
user2: Gave me a sense of justice and closure
user1: she punches him so hard he goes off the boat backwards
user2: Serves him right
user1: So the movie got an 89% from rotten tomatoes, i think it should have been more like a 95%
user2: Yep, it was pretty good. 
user1: and metacritics only gave it a 74/100 
user2: Yeah I think just the amount of exposure it got there were bound to be people who thought it was overhyped.
user2: What document is this?
user1: but its a Disney movie, for its genre it was amazing 
user1: the one they gave me with the stats about the movie 
user2: Oh is this the last one I mean?
user1: yup
user2: Do we manually click the finish conversation button or it ends automatically?
user1: have we done 15 each im gonna go count
user2: Ok
user1: yup we've done enough, nice talking with you 
user2: Nice talking with you too!
user2: It was a pleasure

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hello! 
user2: interesting movie isn't it?
user2: do u have the script as well?
user1: Yes, I do.
user2: sweet. I think 89% is not too good though but managable
user1: I agree. Are we supposed to be chatting with a 3rd person. 
user2: really? i dont think so, we are supposed to talk about the movie
user2: I have seen it in real life though I think it's quite ok
user1: I have seen the movie as well. 
user1: I thought the movie was cute. 
user2: Nice nice, I think disney is leading when it comes to make animated movies
user2: I like the songs in it as well
user1: So do my children
user2: ah..nice, i wanted to ask if u have kids..hahaha
user1: What is Elsa’s special power? If you could have one special power, what would it be? Why?
user2: oh well, nice way to keep our young ones dreamy about woman and man relationships. I am not against lgbt but I think I would want my daughter to fall in love 
user2: If i could have special power I would make everyone fall in love with the right person
user1: She has power over the ice and snow.
user1: Who do you like best, Elsa or Anna?
user2: yes yes
user2: Anna 
user2: Else almost turned into something else
user1: Agreed! 
user1: What was the snowman’s name?
user2: Kristoff :)
user1: Olaf!
user1: Does he love hugs? 
user2: can't remember, trying to read the script for it..but tell me
user1: Yes, he LOVES hugs! 
user1: What else does he love?
user2: oh its all above love, hugs should be an extra juicy juicy ]
user1: He loves Summer.
user1: Were you sad when Olaf started melting? Do you remember what he said to Anna? It was so nice!
user2: it means he does not like snow
user2: we can end it now...nice talking with u user 2
user1: He said, "Some people are worth melting for." 

conversation:
user1: That was a pretty great movie. Everyone seems to love it.
user2: NOTHING
user1: I thought Kristen Bell did a great job as the younger sister.
user2: YES
user1: I agree with the Rotten Tomato score. I would give it around a 90% as well.
user2: THANK YOU
user1: The song by Idina Menzel was brilliant.
user2: SHE IS A NICE SINGER
user1: Do you like disney movies in general?
user2: YES
user1: I'm a big fan of magic. Did you think the magic in the movie was impressive?
user2: NO
user1: Oh, that's too bad. What did you like about the movie the most?
user2: FIGHT MOVIES
user1: Oh that's odd. This wasn't a fight movie. Did you like Elsa better as a child, teen, or an adult?
user2: HAHAHA? NO NO I AM LIKE FIGHT MOVIES
user1: Did you think it was a good idea when the parent's erased Anna's memory like that? I thought that was weird.
user2: I KNOW? GOOD BYE...
user1: Did you like the part where Anna get's married?
user1: Are you still there?
user2: YES
user2: AM NOT SEE THAT ANNA MARRIEGE
user1: Oh, did you like the part when Elsa finally uses her powers?
user2: NO

conversation:
user2: Hi there, what do you think of the movie Frozen?
user1: I really like the story and the reindeer character.
user1: I like Olaf as well--the snowman.
user1: What do you think or Kristen Bell as Anna?
user2: I think she played the role of Anna very well
user1: I do, too.  I also liked Katie Lopez in the voice of 5 year old Anna.  Did you?
user2: I thought her singing was okay 
user1: Did you prefer one of the other singers?
user2: I'm not a particular Disney fan however I liked Elsa's singing
user1: Yes, Elsa's singing was strong.
user1: What did you think of Kristoff?
user2: I almost forgot the film was released in 2013, it feels like it wasn't that long ago
user1: I agree
user2: I think Kristoff is a good supporting character 
user1: Did you prefer Elsa or Anna as characters?
user2: I think I prefer Anna as a character because I could relate to her more than Elsa
user1: Because she wasn't magic?
user1: I don't remember the parts of the moving when they were children as well as the parts when they were grown.
user2: Mainly because I am the younger sibling in my family and anna was just trying to connect with her older sibling after her memory was erased
user1: That makes sense.  I am a younger sibling, too, so I liked that about Anna as well.
user2: In the scene where Elsas flees the kingdom and creates her ice palace to live in solitude, it reminds me of my brother tends to keep to himself
user1: I'm more solitary than my brother, so maybe I'm more like Elsa.
user2: What is your favorite scene from Frozen?
user1: Any of the scenes involving Olaf.  I think he's very funny.
user1: What about you?  What is your favorite scene from Frozen?
user1: Do you agree with the rotten tomatoes scores of 89% for this film?
user2: Yes, I believe the film deserved that rating. It was well received by a lot of people I know
user1: What did you think of the scene where Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart?
user2: I thought it was sad but sort of expected it from Elsa's character
user1: When did you realize that Hans for bad?
user2: Did you expect to see the twist where Hans wanted to take over Arendelle?
user2: I realized he was bad when he locked Anna in a room
user1: No.  I thought that was surprising, though it was a nice way to change the story.
user1: Do you remember how Elsa escapes from her cell?
user2: To be honest, no 
user1: I don't either.

conversation:
user2: What is the name of the movie?
user1: Frozen
user2: Oh that's a nice movie.
user1: yes it is 
user2: I have listen about it very often.
user2: And I am keen to watch this movie.
user1: you should definitely watch if you enjoy cute Disney movies
user2: Can you describe a scene from Frozen?
user1: Sure, there are two sisters and one of them has magical powers that she can not control and when they are playing the magical one accidently strikes her little sister so her parents get help from some gnomes and decide to keep it a secret and wipe the little sisters memories so she no longer aware of her sisters powers. that's how the movie begins
user2: Oh really, that looks interesting.
user2: Any other scene which you find much interesting?
user2: Something which anyone would love to watch.
user1: they are all really interesting but my favorite is that the sisters create a little snowman who talks and he is so cute
user2: How could that happen?
user1: magic he has little snow flurries that follow him so he doesn't melt in the summer
user2: They have shown in the movie how a snowman speaks up.
user1: yeah
user1: of course
user1: you can see the show on broadway and everything noe
user2: Does this snowman has good behaviour or is an evil?
user1: he is good
user2: Let me check.
user1: it is voice castes by Kristen bell 
user2: By the way thanks.
user1: youre welcome
user1: it is rated well on rotten tomatoes
user1: given an a+
user1: came out in 2013
user2: ok
user1: idina menzel also is a voice

conversation:
user1: Hello
user2: Hello!
user1: What is the name of the movie?
user2: The name of the movie we will be talking about today is "Frozen"
user2: Have you seen it before?
user1: I have not
user1: what studio produced and released it?
user2: It was produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and release by Walt Disney Pictures.
user1: Does it sound like a good movie?
user2: Yes, It is about about a fearless princess who sets off on a journey to find her estranged sister whose icy powers trapped their kingdom in an eternal winter
user1: Do you recommend that I watch the movie?
user2: Do you enjoy watching animated movies?
user1: I'm pretty indifferent, I don't think they're more or less interesting than live action movies
user2: Well it is an animated comedy/adventure movie. There are some intense parts and the graphics are high-quality as it was released in 2013
user1: That sounds interesting, who's in it?
user2: Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel & Jonathan Groff
user1: Does it have good ratings with critics?
user2: Rotten Tomatoes: 89%
user2: Metacritics: 74/100
user2: CinemaScore A+
user2: This is one of the most critical reviews: "while it lags the tiniest bit on its way to the conclusion, the script... really delivers; it offerscharacters to care about, along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way."
user1: That sounds like pretty good set of scores
user2: And the least critical review: "a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core, brilliant Broadway-stylesongs and a crafty plot. Its first and third acts are better than the jokey middle, but this isthe rare example of a Walt Disney Animation Studios effort that reaches as deep as aPixar film."
user1: Pixar generally does good movies, to my knowledge
user2: One of my favorite scenes is when the sisters are young and playing together when things get out of hand and the sister with icy powers freezes her sisters mind ~ they go to a colony of trolls to heal her.
user1: I've never heard of trolls healing
user2: lol yeah it sounds pretty strange but that is what makes it interesting.
user1: It sounds like an interesting movie to watch. I've seen some other Pixar movies in the past.
user2: It definitely is! 
user2: Brave is my favorite disney movie, but this one is probably my 2nd
user1: I've never heard of Brave, is that Pixar or something else?
user2: I believe it is Disney production. 
user2: It features a red curly-haired princess in a green dress.
user1: I don't know anything about Disney main line movies, I just know about the Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands on heir own
user1: I didn't know they made movies anymore outside of their sub-studios
user1: I think we can finish the conversation by the way
user2: Okay, have a great day!

conversation:
user1: Hi, if you're into animated musical movies, you should really check out 2013 movie Frozen from Disney.
user2: why should i check out this movie, i think it will be more for kids. since its disney.
user2: i have to admit though i have watched a couple of musicals with young ones from my family.
user1: You're right but it is not just a typical musical movie. It's also an adventure in which the princess sets out on a journey to find her estranged sister.
user1: It has got around 89% of rotten tomatoes rating if you prefer watching movies having good ratings.
user2: hmmmm, i know it might be completely different in genre but this brings me back to times of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA
user2: Wow 89% really is a high number. what else do you have for me this is getting interesting.
user1: Critics have raved it as the best-animated musical to come out of Disney. This movie has so many likable characters like; the rugged iceman, the reindeer, and a naive snowman.
user1: You might be familiar with Kristen Bell, she has provided the voice for the main protagonist's sister Anna.
user1: You can also watch this movie for all the Icy powers shown in the movie and how those powers trapped the kingdom in an eternal winter.

conversation:
user1: hi
user2: Hello
user2: So, Frozen. fun. I really like Kristen Bell. 
user1: yes, she was elsa's younger sister
user1: this was a 213 american computer animated motion picture
user2: Apparently, her younger sister was also played by Livvy Stubenrauch, Katie Lopez and Agatha Lee
user1: did you know it was ispired by Hans Christian Anderson
user2: Interesting. 
user2: It got an 89 percent on rotten tomatoes, so that's something...
user1: Idina Menzel was Elsa, she's so wickedly talented
user1: i love the colony of trolls aspect of the film, it was just so fresh to see that type of thing
user2: Yeah, she possessed a cyro kinetic magic
user2: or something
user1: that's true. But how about one critic claiming it lags the tiniest bit. What a world we live in!
user2: It did lag a little bit
user1: Te movie Frozen? Why yes, it did seem to lag just a bit. at least according to one critic.
user1: I thought the choice to make the snowman naive was a choice that should have been made and was.
user2: When Anna falls in love with Prince Hans, it is a really funny scene. 
user1: Yes. I agree with another critic whose response declared the movie a great big snowy treasure. That was a sentence constructed by an adult and professional film critic.
user2: A poet. heh.
user1: Do you think the movie frozen is destined to become a broadway musical?
user2: I do agree that it is as deep as a Pixar film, and perhaps exceeded them.
user1: As far as genres go, you can't deny that it is a comedy, adcenture, animation
user2: Aren't all Disney films destine for Broadway, or at least a touring company?
user1: I can't find the answer to that on my sheet
user2: It does seem to fit all of the genres 
user2: It was rhetorical. 
user1: your big words don't intimidate me. Do you suppose Frozen is a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural interest?
user2: Certainly, a renewed cultural interest in their animation division. 
user1: Are we done? I think we're done.
user2: I hope so.

conversation:
user2: hi there
user1: Hello! The movie is Frozen
user2: What's it about??
user1: It's about computer animated fantasy movie based on the Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale "The SNow Queen"
user2: Is it 3D like pixar movies?
user2: Or 2d animation?
user1: It's about a brave princess who goes in search of her sister. 
user1: Yes  it is 3D animated
user2: What did it get on rotten tomatoes?
user2: Did you enjoy it?
user1: It got a 89% rating
user1: I thought the film was pretty and the songs were nice.
user2: Who are the singers?
user2: Wow good score!
user2: And who made the fim?
user1: Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel sing 
user1: Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed the film
user2: But what company?
user2: Is it like Dreamwroks?
user1: Walt Disney Animation Studios produced the film
user2: Oh cool
user2: What was your favorite part?
user1: It was released by Walt Disney Pictures and is the 53rd Disney animated feature
user2: Wow 53
user1: I liked the parts with the reindeer and Kristoff, an iceman. The reindeer, Sven, was pretty funny.
user2: Is there a sequel?
user2: Or just the one
user1: There is no sequel at this time.
user2: So what else should I know?
user2: It sounds pretty neat!
user2: What's the best song in it?
user1: There are a lot of good songs. I'm not sure if I could pick the best one.
user2: Haha okay
user1: The two sisters are Anna and Elsa. Elsa has special powers that let her freeze things.
user2: It is on Broadway now apparently

conversation:
user1: Hi, have you seen Frozen yet?
user2: Yes, I have. Have you?
user1: Yeah, I really enjoyed Idina Menzel's singing. Did you have a favorite actor?
user2: Yes, my favorite character in the movie is Anna herself.
user1: Oh I agree, she's a far stronger character, isn't she?
user2: Yes, she is very strong, going on the journey to find her sister was brave on her part.
user1: I had a hard time reconciling Kristen Bell's voice with what I knew about her then. She really can sing!
user2: It feels like watching a Broadway musical to be honest.
user2: Do you know what this movie is based on?
user2: It is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale called "The Snow Queen".
user1: Wow, I think the server is really slow, I just got all your essages at once.
user1: I thought I'd read something about that, but I don't know that I've ever read the original story. Have you?
user2: It can happen sometimes. And no, I haven't read that, either.
user1: What did you think of the role of the trolls in the movie? I was very conflicted about whether or not they were actually doing good for anna and elsa.
user2: You mean the rugged iceman or his loyal pet reindeer?
user2: Or are you talking about the naive snowman?
user1: No, the trolls that the parents took anna to see when they were kids and elsa accidentally blasted her with her magic
user2: I think it might have been important to their character development, for example ..
user2: After Grand Pabble heals Anna and cleared her memories, it must have taught Elsa to control her powers but also..
user2: That all magic can be reverted.
user1: Yeah, I can see that. I was just thinking that the troll wasn't really doing either girl any good by telling them to have elsa keep all bottled up.
user2: Yes, it created a rift between then, which was not good. 
user1: But now I think about it, I wonder, was that more of her parents' interpretation than the specific advice? 
user1: from the troll?
user1: I honestly cannot remember
user2: Could have been both but it didn't help, he should have taught Elsa to master her magic instead of keeping it bottled.
user1: I mean, I can see what all the little girls love Elsa as a character, but I think that she isn't as great of a role model as Anna.
user1: That is, if Elsa had learned to master her magic rather than ignore it, it would have been a very different story.
user2: I think she has much pride and arrogance since she knows that when she turns twenty-one she'll be the queen of Arendelle.
user1: At the same time, Anna continually reached out to Elsa, never wavering in her sisterly love
user1: That's an interesting point of view?
user1: Sorry, I didn't mean to add a ?
user2: I mean she does knows that she would be queen but only if the Duke doesn't finds about her powers, but that didn't happen, did it?
user1: Well, but I think she still gets to be queen, right? And the Duke was after Anna, wasn't he? If I remember correctly he was the 6th son or somethign and never really had a chance unless he married a princess
user2: Are you talking about Prince Hans of the Southern Isles?
user2: Because I think, he was the one plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both the sisters.
user2: You know the way he locks Anna in the room to die so the dignitaries think that Elsa killed her.
user2: But failed when Anna escapes from the detention cell.
user2: Still there..?
user2: It's been more than 5 minutes from your last response, I'll leave now.

conversation:
user2: Hello
user1: Hi, we are talking about the movie Frozen. 
user2: Good movie, I think everyone knows the lyrics to the songs.
user1: Movie critics say it's the best animated musical.
user2: What do you think?
user1: I think you should watch it. Kristen Bell does the voice of Anna.
user1: Rotten Tomatoes rated it 89%.
user2: I have watched it
user2: My kid watched it every day for like a month
user1: Did you like it? Yeah, same here. My grand daughter watched it so many times.
user2: I did like it
user2: I liked how it was based on women
user1: Can you believe it was made in 2013? Has it been that long?
user2: lol getting old
user2: Yea, crazy how time flies
user1: It's inspired by Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Ice Queen". I had no idea.
user2: what do you think about making a second movie?
user1: I didn't know that, but not surprising.
user2: They aren't making one just wanted to know your thoughts about it
user1: It says Frozen is both declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance and reaffirmation of its coming to terns with own legacy...
user1: So they may make another one...
user2: I hope so.
user2: Because it is so popular
user1: Yes, it is. It has CinamaScore of A+
user1: I wonder if they make a new one, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee will direct again.
user2: I'm sure they would
user2: It is basically their franchise
user1: Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel will do the voice as well? I hope so.
user2: I'm pretty sure they would keep everything as is
user1: Do you like animation movie as genre?
user2: Yes, I love them
user2: I think they teach a lot of life lessons to younger kids

conversation:
user1: I was really surprised that disney chose Kristen Bell to be the voice of Anna in Frozen
user2: Yes, I didn't imagine it'd be her!
user2: What do you think about the rating? 
user1: It was high enough for a Disney move, you know they don't make anything lower than a 70 
user1: I do think it was overkill to use three different voice actors for anna 
user2: Yeah, but it doesn't match with the critical response written so I thought it was odd
user2: Yup that's overdoing it
user1: I understand the critical responses were hypes, but i don't think frozen was better than the classics  
user2: yeah
user2: which character do admire most?
user1: Elsa,  only because her outfit though
user2: yeah mine too
user1: I also don't think that the critical response of frozen being culturally relevant is true 
user2: really why?
user1: If frozen made Disney culturally relevant then we would have more than one truly dark skin princess, and not have just added two new princesses of another culture
user2: Yeah, that's reasonable
user2: I think it'd be good as a broadway musical.
user1: yeah, the music would be wonderful to hear being sung by a chorus
user2: I think Elsa is cool but I don't think she should've hidden that much.
user1: Im trying to figure out in the movie how a duke has enough power to tell a newly inducted queen that she is a monster and turns the whole kingdom against her. He is lower in status!
user2: Yeah that bothers me a lot. 
user2: and everyone just listens to him like it's natural.
user1: exactly, she shouldn't have run, she should of had him imprisoned or something. 
user2: now, that makes sense
user2: but discard the crown and then live alone seems miserable and not fitting for a queen.
user1: i guess that  is what insecurity does to you 
user1: she did make a nice castle
user2: Yeah, I'll give her that
user2: She "accidentally" freezes her heart..again.
user1: slick
user2: are you there?

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hello
user2: Have you ever seen Frozen?
user1: I haven't, have you?
user2: I have. I liked it
user1: What was your favorite part of the movie?
user2: I am surprised that it only got an 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes
user2: My favorite part is when she meets the snowman
user1: 89 percent is pretty high on Rotten Tomatoes, isn't it? 
user2: Yeah, but I thought this one would get in the upper 90's
user1: I think it's surprising how Let It Go got to be like super popular in such a short amount of time. 
user2: I know. I heard that song before I saw the movie
user2: It's interesting because it got 74/100 on Metacritics
user1: Yeah that seems kind of low.
user2: The critical response was good
user1: Do you think there's a reason that some people might have rated it harshly?
user2: Maybe they did not like the director. Also, I could see how some parts of the movie anger people
user1: Ah, do you mind explaining a little bit? Like I said, I've never seen it.
user2: Yeah, the trolls at the beginning were a bit strange and the lead princess does not have a Prince.
user1: Ah so it kind of breaks the Disney mold? 
user2: Yeah, that is a good way to put it
user1: Do you think that it's going to have a sequel? I haven't heard anything about one, which is weird considering how popular it was.
user2: I do. I have read a couple things about a sequel. 
user1: Wow I feel so out of the loop. The most I hear about Disney is Star Wars. 
user2: Do you know who Kristen Bell is?
user1: Um yeah she's Anna in the movie, right? Isn't she also Veronica Mars?
user2: Yes, that's right
user1: Did she sing in the movie?
user2: I think so.
user1: Oh cool. Did you have a favorite character? 
user2: Yes, I liked the big ice monster guy

user2: I do and I don't.  Sometimes the critics are so full of themselves that they hate movies that I like
user2: what about you
user1: I don't pay much attention to critics. However I wasn't surprised to see that Frozen had very high critic ratings
user1: do you often like animated movies?
user2: I do when I catch them on tv. I wouldn't typically go seek them out

user2: Elsa is my favorite character too. What other characters do you like?
user1: I think what really makes it a great movie is that the sister doesn’t give up on Elsa no matter what and ends up making Elsa feel better!

user2: Yes, her sister is great. I forget her name though.
user1: I think it is Anna

user2: Or when it was produced ?
user2: Are you still there?

conversation:
user2: hello, are you there? I am anxious to learn about the movie you saw
user1: The movie is a Disney movie that came out in 2013 about 2 sisters.
user2: Cool, my gilrfriend's daughter should enjoy that. Would you recommend it for a 12 year old girl?
user1: Its a story of a fearless princess who sets off on a journey alongside a rugged iceman, his pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister who has icy powers.
user1: yes
user2: Sounds like a fun fantasy adventure. how long is the movie? you know how kids can be attention wise

conversation:
user2: Frozen was a nice movie.
user2: Do you like animated movies?\
user1: Animation movies are most definitely not my favorite. But my kids enjoy them a lot and there are a couple including Frozen that I have found to be super intriguing and not so terrible for me to watch either. I actually enjoy some of the animations and don't mind at all when they want to watch them 50 million times in a row.
user1: How did you feel about Frozen?
user2: I didn't really like Frozen too much but I can see why it would be appealing to kids.
user1: The 3D computer animation in this movie was awesome. You should definitely take some time to sit down and watch it. The stars in the movie Kristen Bell, Idina Manzel, and Jonathan Groff did an awesome job as the voices as well. i have two little boys so I didnt think they would be into this movie too much but they both loved it
user2: Ah I see. yes I noticed that the animation was very detailed. 
user2: Did you or your boys have a favorite character?
user1: My older son loved Anna played by Kristen Bell. Who was your favorite charcter
user2: I see! I did not really have a favorite.I think I liked the reindeer the best.
user1: Haha Sven, yeah he was a pretty cool raindeer and Kristoff's best friend pretty much
user2: Did you know that the movie is based on Hans Christian Anderson's "The Snow Queen"?
user1: No I did not. I also did not realize that their parents had died at sea when I was watching the movie I never did understand what had happened to them
user2: Ah yeah. I didn't like that part since the abrupt nature of their death seemed to lack much meaning.
user2: It felt like a plot device.
user1: Will you be going to see the musical? They have come out with it already
user2: I didn't know they had a musical. I don't really like musicals so I likely will not.
user1: Yes I agree about the death
user1: I dont like musicals either but this one was really cute
user2: Are your boys interested in the musical?
user2: Or have you already seen it?
user1: Do you agree with the comment "the best animated musical to come out of Disney"?
user2: It was really popular so I think a lot of people thought so. Personally I thought it was mediocre.
user1: I can understand that. Im still a bigger fan of the movies from when I was a kid "snow White", "Robin Hood" "Beauty and the Beast"
user2: Yeah, past movies seemed better.
user2: Of Disney's films I think I enjoyed Lion King the best.
user1: Its crazy still that this was the 53rd Disney animated feature. I thought there was way more than that
user2: Yeah it's still impressive.
user2: It's hard to believe it was released in 2013. that feels so long ago.
user1: Definitly and I also agree with the comment that its a declaration of Disney's renewed culture. This movie is completely differnt than the films DIsney had out when I was a child
user2: Do you prefer 3D animated movies like Frozen or 2D animated movies like Beauty and the Beast or Robin Hood?\
user2: Yes I think that critic was right.
user1: Im not into 3D much. I dont really see the differnce except in the price when you go to the theatres lol
user2: Ah I see. It was enjoyable talking to you.
user1: Same as with you
user2: have a good day :)
user1: You as well

conversation:
user2: The critics say this is the best animated musical to come out of Disney since the little mermaid!
user1: Yeah, that's impressive. It's weird that the metacritic score is so low
user2: Yes, but it got an A+ on Cinemascore
user1: That's true. How do you feel about the voice actors? 
user2: I like Kristen Bell, I think she did a really good job. Didn
user2: didnt know she could sing
user2: Do you watch alot of Disney movies?

conversation:
user2: hello
user1: Hello, how are you today?
user2: im good
user1: Have you ever seen the movie Frozen?
user2: yes i have why?
user1: Well, I was wondering what you think about it...Rotten Tomatoes scored it an 89% out of 100. Do you think that is a fair rating?
user2: i think it was a really good movie... i would say 89% is a pretty good score and i would rate it similarly 
user1: Would you consider watching it again?
user2: i have seen it multiple times already but yea i would but not as a first choice watch 
user1: I'm surprised you wouldn't pick it as your first choice because the critics say that it is the best animated musical to come out of Disney sits hits like "The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast".  Would you agree?
user2: yes i would, its definitely as good as those movies... 
user1: Who would you say is your favorite character of the movie: Anna or Elsa?
user2: i think anna is fun and optimistic and refreshing to see when she would appear... elsa is kind of cold/serious so i prefer anna although elsa is more endearing 
user1: I agree, I loved Anna.  However, I also enjoyed Kristoff...the snowman.  Did you enjoy Kristoff?
user2: yea i think he was funny, his interactions with anna were fun
user1: I agree.  Did you know that Frozen was actually inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen"?
user2: yes i did but i havent read the original material
user1: What did you think about Princess Elsa's magical cryokinetic powers? (The ability to freeze things)
user2: i think it fits her personality
user1: Yes, I would agree.  Like you said she did have a cold personality, but I think her cold personality came from not really understanding her magical powers.
user1: I think that
user1: I think that's why she was so terrified to become the queen...because she did not want others to know about her powers.
user2: its an extension of how she feels, how she feels internally is then displayed through her powers 
user1: I would agree.  I think Elsa really got confused and scared of her powers when she accidentally froze Anna's heart.  Do you remember that part? 
user2: yea i do 
user2: it was their love that melted it right? i cant remember exactly 
user1: Yes, eventually it was "an act of true love" that reversed the spell.  That was only after the character Hans tried to take over Arendelle.
user1: I didn't even make the connection of Hans the character and the author of the original material this movie was inspired from.
user2: what was the connection?
user1: Well, first the name, of course.  But the two seem to have the same demeanor, according to what reports say about the author of the book.  This really makes me want to see this movie yet another time.
user1: It was nice talking to you!

conversation:
user1: Hey
user2: hi
user2: how are you
user2: have you watch Frozen 3D movie
user2: this is the best comedy adventure movie
user1: No I haven't seen it

user1: so, the music is good?
user2: the snow Queen fairless princes
user1: how many times have you seen it?
user2: who go for a journey 
user2: 2
user1: a snow queen goes on a journey?
user2: i saw two times
user2: yes the story of the snowy queen
user1: wow, you must really like it. Do you have kids who like it?
user1: have you heard any of the songs before?
user2: no not before 
user2: have you
user1: I'm not sure because I haven't seen it.
user1: is this the movie with the two sisters in it?
user1: and one sister turns things into ice
user1: does the movie have a talking snow man?
user2: yes\
user2: no talking ice man
user1: what is your favorite part of the movie?
user2: the movie the  newly-crowned Queen Elsa accidentally uses her power to turn things into ice to curse her home in infinite winter, her sister Anna teams up with a mountain man, his playful The IMDb Show" sits down with stars of the 2018 Sundance Film Festival to find out their favorite Sundance movies,
user1: Is this the same movie as Frozen?
user2: the Elsa character
user2: yes
user1: I have seen Frozen. Yes and I like the Elsa character
user1: Do you remember the song "Let it go" 
user2: no 

conversation:
user1: Hi there :)
user2: Hello.
user1: Disney has done it again releasing another great movie, I see, called Frozen
user2: That sounds interesting. What is it about?
user1: First of all it's an animated musical fantasy which tells the story of a fearless princess, on a journey, to find her estranged sister
user2: Would it be good for younger children? Or is it scary
user1: I believe it would be perfect for younger children, like 4 and up, especially because it's 3D, animated and a musical. Children love, love, love fantasy, is also why it would be a good movie for them
user2: Would parents like it too? Sometimes kids movies are boring for parents.
user1: I believe, I'd definitely want to see it, the theme of the movie can definitely hold the interest of older viewers, it's a movie that really delivered, and offers characters that one can connect with, exciting twists, and loads of surprises that any movie goer would walk away highly entertained
user2: I do like Disney movies usually. It sounds like this one has a princess is that right? Is it very empowering for girls or more of a damsel in distress story?
user1: I'm impressed that it has a Princess, and girls and women of all ages can connect with that. Though it's more of a heroine, than damsel in distree
user1: distress... typing error lol
user2: Ha ha. What was your favorite song from the movie? 
user1: I wouldn't be a good judge for songs, especially because I really enjoyed all of them :)
user2: Fair enough. Did the movie have other good characters?
user1: definitely! There's a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer, and a naive snowman that accompany the Princess on her journey to find her sister
user1: sort of another rendition of the Oz, with their journey along the Yellow Brick Road, sort of
user2: And who are the villain(s)? What is the conflict about in the film?
user1: the scheming Duke of Wesselton though Elsa, the main character, is trying desperately to keep her powers secret from all the other villagers, because inadvertently releasing her powers, the Duke brands her as a monster. Whereby she flees the kingdom, because of that
user1: This one, is also heralded as one of the best animated musicals to come out of Disney, since Little Mermaid

conversation:
user1: Hi, we will be talking about the movie Frozen. 
user1: It was a critically acclaimed movie starring Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel. 
user2: Hello! I did not see the movie, but know it's highly rated. Is that true?
user1: Yes, it was called "a plain terrific bit of family entertainment." 
user1: Do you like animated musicals?
user2: Would you be likely to advise me to see the movie?
user2: Well I have enjoyed ones I have seen in the past.
user1: Yes, it got a 89% on Rotten Tomatoes.
user1: It also got a Cinema Score of A+.
user2: Those are great scores. Did you see the movie?
user1: Yes, I did, a couple of times. Would a good rating make you want to see it?
user2: It might, but I prefer horror. You must like it a lot or have children! Is this more for children?
user1: Since it is Disney film, it would definitely be good for kids, but it's considered a comedy, adventure, action movie, so adults like it too. 
user2: Wow. Do you know if the song received any awards? I hear parents moan about it sometimes.
user1: One of the key scenes deals with Elsa's magic powers, so that might appeal to someone who likes horror! 
user2: Lol! I think you may have talked me in to seeing this movie. 
user1: Probably, but I'm not sure. It has Broadway-style songs, so maybe?
user2: Does it have a happy ending?
user1: It's basically about two sisters, one has magical cryokinetic powers, and almost kills her younger sister when they're kids. Elsa, the older one, has to learn how to control her powers. 
user2: That sounds like a good message for both kids and adults.
user1: Mayhem ensues when Elsa becomes queen, and she flees the kingdom after she causes something bad to happen. The Duke of the kingdom thinks she is a monster and she runs away. 
user1: It does have a good message because her younger sister doesn't give up on finding her. 
user2: But do they end up friends with the kingdom in the end?
user1: I think you will have to see the movie! If you know any old fairy tales, it's inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, but I don't know how that ends!
user2: Well anything by Hans Christian Anderson is good enough for me. Is there anything else you want me to know about the movie? 
user2: Do you know how long the movie is?
user1: It also has some trolls it in, and a giant snow monster called Marshmallow, so that might appeal to your love of horror! Lol! The trolls are friendly though, and they actually save the younger sister's (Anna's) life.
user1: Hmmm, I don't know, but you could google that info. 
user2: Do you know what the movie is rated?
user2: I love trolls and marshmallows; separately of course!
user1: I don't know for sure, but since it's a Disney movie, it's probably G or PG, I
user1: I'd google that too. 
user2: Thanks! Nice talking to you!
user1: Thanks! You too! 

conversation:
user1: Hi!
user2: Hello! Nice to "meet" you.
user1: Do you usually check out Rotten Tomatoes before watching a movie?
user2: Sometimes. I most often check what Roger Ebert's review site has to say. How about you?
user1: Love me some Rotten Tomatoes - have you ever seen Frozen?
user2: Apparently Frozen has a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes. I have not seen it!
user2: Have you? I guess I'm late to the party since it came out in 2013
user1: It's 89% on there. It's great! One critic said it was the best animated Disney musical since the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast
user2: Yeah! I did not know that it was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's story "The Snow Queen." That's cool.
user2: I am curious about the characters, and how once of them accidentally caused eternal winter. 
user1: Oh, you're talking about Elsa
user2: Yes! Wow, cryokinetic magic. Sounds cool, if dangerous.
user1: Yeah, her parents try to cover up her powers but then they die at sea
user1: Elsa shuts out her sister, Anna, because she is insecure about her powers
user2: It's interesting that Anna's memories are altered so she forgets about Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie the troll must also have powers.
user2: And Elsa must learn to control hers.
user1: Yup. Do you usually like comedies?
user2: Depends! A lot of the time, yes. I love to laugh.
user2: Aw, poor Elsa sounds lonely. The Duke calls her a monster, and she is scared of her own powers. Not to mention very isolated.
user1: Yeah, it's sad.
user2: I like the idea that it is the suppression of magic, and not the use of it, that causes the eternal winter. That is interesting.
user1: Her unleashing eternal winter was an accident!
user2: It would be scary to be able to accidentally do that, eeps.
user2: And Elsa is scared the kingdom will find out about her powers! So the people must not even know.
user2: Do you like animated movies?
user1: Not usually, but this one was really well done
user1: The scene where Elsa freezes Anna's heart is pretty sad
user2: It sounds awful! Man this girl has a tough time with the things she can accidentally do. Freezing your sister's heart sounds terrible.
user2: And what is going on with Hans, I thought he was cool. But no, he wants to seize the throne of course.
user1: Yeah, he was pretty awful
user1: Goes from proposing to Anna to murder pretty quickly
user2: Yeah locking someone in a room to die is pretty cold.
user2: oh. ha. haha. did not mean that to be a pun but whatever.
user1: Nice
user1: Also, ordering Elsa's execution
user2: Yeah! Luckily she escaped. I have a feeling I know where this is going.
user1: Well, it was nice talking to you.
user1: You should definitely check out Frozen!
user2: You too, thanks! I think I will. Have a good rest of your day!

conversation:
user2: do u like animated movies?
user1: sure
user2: oh Hi
user1: hello
user1: So what's this movie?
user2: frozen
user2: dont u have d document?

user2: oh ok. So its about two sisters
user2: one has magical powers 
user2: Anna and Elsa
user1: Right this is a Disney movie yes?
user2: YEs
user1: Okay interesting, and what else is it about?
user2: The eldest sister Elsa is the snow queen cos of her magical powers
user2: she could not stay with people cos everything turns into snow so she left home to where she wouldnt hurt anyone
user2: she accidentally hurt everyone with her magic
user2: sister , father and mother
user1: How did she get those powers?
user2: thats why she left home
user2: they were playing with cryptonite 
user1: cryptonite?
user2: sorry..cryokinetic magic
user2: they were playing with it and didnt know it would turn her into something else
user1: ah okay
user1: And what's the rest of the movie about?
user2: the father rushes both of them to a troll for healing
user2: he heals the younger sister
user2: but forgets to remove d memories from d elder sister
user2: the trol warns that the only way is for her to control the magic
user1: sounds interesting
user2: she actually couldnt control it...and was turning 21..age to be crowned
user2: and she was scared of hurting people so she left home
user1: they are both royalty? 
user2: yes daughters to the king  and queen of the kingdom
user1: where did she go to?
user1: who's the main character?
user1: so is this a kid's movie?
user1: or would adults enjoy it?
user1: ?

conversation:
user2: hello!
user2: have you ever seen frozen? 
user1: no, have you
user2: yep, you aren't missing anything. i didn't like it.
user1: wow, I would think that I would like it
user1: they have some of the best music for this movie
user2: the songs aren't bad, i just didn't enjoy the story that much
user1: was there anything that you liked about the movie?
user2: the songs were the best part for sure - i just didn't enjoy the characters or their personalities 
user1: I saw commercials and I love the dresses! they are so pretty
user2: the character design was very cute- maybe i'm just a grump!
user1: Kristen Bell as Anna in my opinion was a great choice
user1: she is so pretty
user2: she is! i was about to say i had no idea that she could sing
user1: I know,
user2: now i feel like giving it a second chance - i watched it in theatres almost 5 years ago
user1: In my opinion I think Disney does a fantastic job at picking the people for these parts
user2: i agree, the voice actors make everything
user1: you should maybe you didn't like it because it became too much
user1: because everyone was singing the songs and it was just repitition
user2: you're probably right, the songs played everywhere all the time when it first came out 
user1: I think I am going to try to watch it this weekend
user2: is it on netflix yet? 
user1: I really love the singing parts, they are what makes the story line
user1: Could you even imagine having powers where you could freeze things
user1: I think it is
user2: haha i think it would be more useful than we think
user1: I think I maybe would be scared of those powers
user2: or what if you lost control and froze your dog? 
user1: I know that is what I was thinking
user1: or accidentally froze your husband or children
user2: i don't remember 100% if she had control of it or not
user2: haha 
user2: yeah that would be terrible
user1: lol
user1: yep
user1: the grand pabble was the rock person
user1: are you there

conversation:
user1: What is the movie about?
user2: You should see Frozen since it's one of the best-animated musicals to come out of Disney.  Two sisters fight an eternal winter.
user1: That sounds interesting.Who are the main characters
user1: Nams?
user1: Names?
user2: The main characters are two sisters, Elsa, the Snow Queen of Arendelle and Anna, the Princess of Arendelle.   There is also Kristoff who is an iceman with a reindeer named Sven.
user1: You say its a musical. How did you like the music? 
user2: Frozen has top musical ratings from a variety of critics with stunning broadway quality music.
user1: Sounds like a movie, I would be interested in seeing.
user1: Does the movie have a lot of comedy in it?
user2: It's the 53rd animated Disney animated feature film and has a clever plot and great music.  You would like it.
user2: Yes, it's a comedy-adventure film
user1: Sounds like it would be a great film for the kids
user1: Some movies even kids movies have inappropriate scenes did you see any
user2: There are lots of jokes in it as well, it's definitely a kids movie. Not inappropriate but the sister's parents die at sea during a storm which may be a dark subject 
user1: That could upset some younger children with the parents dying at sea
user1: However, I think for some older kids the subject will not be upsetting 
user2: There are also scenes where Elsa hurts her sister with magic.  But it's part of the lesson told by the movie which is inspired by Han's Christian Anderson's Snow Queen Faity Tale
user1: Now you say lessons. Is the movie overly preachy
user2: It is more entertaining than preachy, focusing on family entertainment.  
user1: Okay, good. 
user1: What parts would you say would stick out among the rest
user2: Sister Elsa does become upset when her sister falls in love with a Duke at Elsa's crowning which causes her to unleash her powers and put Arendale into a permanent winter, freezing everything and making a magnificent ice palace in the process.
user2: Elsa vows to live a solitary life after she's called a monster
user1: Wow, very intriguing. Why do you think Elsa was so upset by her sisters choice to fall in love with Duke?
user2: Elsa objects to a very quick engagement, it causes her to accidentally show her powers to the court and town
user1: Sounds like a very pivotal 
user1: point in the movie
user1: How do you think this affected Anna?
user2: It gets more tense when Elsa accidentally hurts Anna when she comes to find her to tell her what happened to Arrandelle.  She then realizes she has to save Anna
user1: The story is sounding even more interesting. 
user1: Who do you think had the most growth or development in the film?
user2: But there's a twist in that Anna has been deceived by the man she was in love with, he was really plotting to take over the kingdom from the sisters the whole time.  
user1: Great plot twist!
user2: The movie seems to focus the most on Elsa's growth but Anna definitely goes through a lot too
user1: Would you say the movie is positive
user2: The overall movie is, there are dark moments in the plot but the sister's pull through
user2: Everyone will want to watch the ending
user1: I like that the characters are having dark times but they pull through. I am certain I will see this film! Thank you for your suggestion.
user1: Have a positive and great day
user2: It's one of the best animated Disney films.
user1: It certainly sounds like a great Disney film
user2: Hopefully you agree with the good ratings!

conversation:
user1: How great of a movie this is especially since rotten tomatos even gave them a high score
user2: Yes, it has become one of my favorite Disney movies.
user1: The fact that its a comedy, as well as an adventure animation, shows Walt Disney pictures outdid themselves with this movie. 
user2: The singing in the movie was on point. It reminds me of Disney's old movies.
user1: Oh yes I agree. and the fact that critics even believe its the best-animated musical since the little mermaid and beauty and the beast prove just that 
user2: Yes, they are getting back to their roots. The plot kept me captivated. There was never a dull moment.
user1: I love the well-rounded characters too. I mean how could you not fall in love with them. You have a fearless sister, a unique outcasted sister, a lovable snowman, adorable reindeer, and a ditz guy all wrapped into one. you are sure to love one of the well-rounded characters.
user2: I agree, the characters made me laugh and cry. I am glad there was a little bit of comedy here and there it really topped everything off. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee did a great job directing the film.
user1: I agree they did do a great job. It's funny going into the movie based on the synopsis of the movie I wasn't sure I would like it but glad I gave it a chance. It started it a bit slow but once kristen bell steps into the light everything lights up
user2: She really did a great job playing the princess. I agree, the movie totally caught me off guard. I was expecting an average movie, but I was on the edge of my seat the whole time because you never knew what was going to happen. There were so many surprises.
user1: I was sad to see their parents die so abrupt though when they were just trying to help their daughter. but I feel they should have helped her embrace not get rid of maybe later she wouldn't have been so unstable
user2: I felt it was the parents fault that she became so insecure.
user1: I agree because if she was taught to embrace it she would have never tried to shut her sister out and lock herself away in an ice kingdom. She also wouldn't have froze the whole city of arendelle either
user2: I agree, with great power comes great responsibility. This all could of been avoided if she didn't injure her sister in the first place.
user1: The scenes in the troll village were one of my favorite parts. I mean from the moment they introduced them healing anna to just singing and being apart of their journey even as adults.
user2: That was one of my favorite scenes too. It made me sad when they altered anna's memories. She really didn't deserve that.
user1: Livvy Stubenrauch made 5-year-old anna one of the cutest children ever in a Disney film. she was so cute and funny as well but yeah she didn't deserve that at all. I mean I didn't want her to die but to forget her memories of her sister and why they were so close but then weren't after
user2: You can tell she still cared about her sister later in the film because she objected to the marriage. She wanted what was best  for her sister.
user1: I agree and the romance between Anna and Hans though I think they could have left out. It was overplayed and honestly who falls in love with someone in 5 seconds. i think it was more there to show Elsa go unstable cause of caring for anna's future
user2: I agree their romance was overrated. The duke was the character I hated the most. He made elsa out to be a monster and caused a bunch of catastrophic events. He was a pest.
user1: I think the duke was a silly character and so easy to hate as well. I mean seriously, why was her doing magic at all, make her a monster. Instead of people that have known her or about her their whole life, trying to help her they shun her away instead.
user2: I agree, their actions would have made me live in solitary confinement as well.
user1: The cool making of Elsa making her ice castle and even making Olaf was amazing though. I actually thought the castle looked better than the one in arendelle lol.
user2: I agree that was awesome. The ending was so climactic. I couldn't believe Hans turned out to be a snake.
user1: Yes, Han's was a snake but even with the ending the way it was I did, however, miss what Disney has done in the past. By making true love's kiss be the thing that breaks spells. Where in this movie they took it back being Kristoff and making it her sister. I feel conflicted on that honestly.
user2: I agree that was kind of confusing. The fight scene with marshmallow was fun though.
user1: Yes, that was a fun scene, especially the parts with Olaf being as funny as ever in it. 
user2: Yes, he was very funny. Hans was a master manipulator though. He tricked everyone in to believing elsa was a murderer.
user1: Overall I think Rotten Tomatoes got it right not the absolute best movie but still ranked really high up there with great Disney movies.
user2: I agree I have it in my top 5 Disney movies. The Metacritics score doesn't do it justice.

conversation:
user2: Hi, how are you doing today
user1: I am good! What about you?
user2: i am good as well. thanks
user1: That's good!
user2: Which movie you are  going to talk about today ?
user1: I will be talking about the movie "Frozen". What movies have you watched recently?
user2: I didn't watched any movie recently
user2: what made you to talk about this movie ?

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hi. I just saw Frozen
user2: Did you like it?
user1: I didn't. It's a cartoon / musical. But the kids loved it!
user2: What happens in the movie?
user1: Well, its a princess movie, a fairly tale. You know the drill. Beautifull princess, evil queen, common guy, yada yada yada
user2: How was the music?
user1: I didn't really notice it. Thing is, I not into musicals and cartoons. But you know, you have to indulge the kids or all hell breaks loose. However, if you like that stuff I can say that this was really well done.
user2: So, not that interesting for adults but one of those movies kids watch for the next year and a half 10 times a day?
user1: Hah! Yeah, thats degfinitely whats going down in my pad. However, Pixar animated it. They are really good at what they do. Steve Jobs company, btw. So its prettey impressive stuff. I'm sure some adults will love it. My wife did. And she counts me as a child so....
user2: Is there a part that is your kids' favorite or favorite character?
user2: Are you prepared to let it go?
user1: The Princess has magic powers (surprise!). They liked seeing that.
user1: let it go?
user2: Sounds like a good movie
user2:  I like to pretend that I am a princess.
user2: Sounds like it should magically disappear in the top of a closet perhaps, under an old gym bag
user1: Yeah, I got a house full of Princesses. They all loved the film. Its based on a Hans Christian Anderson story, so its a classic in the genre.
user2: Why is it called Frozen?
user1: Problem is, the Princesses would just order a new one. Then I get the bill. Ka-ching!
user1: It's based on "The Snow Queen", so nordic princess plus the King and Queen punish the Princess so I guess she was stuck / frozen in her castle. 
user2: Understandable
user1: There's also a dashing Prince. As i said: yada, yada, yada...
user2: Does he save the day?
user1: But seriously, the 3D animation is well done. Its a spectacle, like a BWay Musical.
user1: No. Dashing Prince turns out to be evil. Wife and kids have been mad at me ever since.
user1: There's also an Ice Castle, which probably answers your frozen question earlier better.
user2: Im wondering if this hit is a prank. 
user1: So, oddly I'd recommend it as a Family Night flick, especially if you have girls.
user1: The critics loved it too. No joke.

conversation:
user1: Hi there! What did you think of the movie? 
user2: Its a terrific Disney movie with great music
user2: What were your thoughts?
user1: I definitely agree. I thought that it was really original and I love Idina Menzel from Wicked so that was fantastic to hear more of her singing.
user1: Do you think that it's a better movie than some of the movies that came before it, like the Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast?
user1: Are you still there?
user2: hello?
user1: Can you see what I'm writing?
user1: Because I've been messaging you and I'm not sure you're getting my messages?
user2: based on the time stamps of my messages Ive been waiting over 5 minutes for a response so Im going to abort now

conversation:
user1: Hello?
user2: Hi
user1: What movie are you reading about over there? :)
user2: Have you seen Frozen movie?
user1: Nope.
user1: What's it about?
user2: Its a computer animated musical movie
user1: What are they doing?
user2: The movie is inspired by the fairy tale - The Snow Queen
user1: I've never read the fairy tale before.
user1: Is the Snow Queen evil?
user2: Th story revolves around a fearless princes's search for her estranged sister
user1: Ohh.
user2: and how a rugged iceman, his pet reindeer and naive snowman help her out
user1: Sounds kinda cute.
user2: The movie's genre is comedy, adventure
user2: I feel its really worth watching it
user1: Yeah, it sounds cool.
user1: #puns
user2: Do u wish to know more about story?
user1: I asked if the Snow Queen was evil. Or who is she?
user2: Yes
user1: What else?
user2: The two sisters in the plot were Elsa and Anna
user1: Are they really close in the movie?
user2: Elsa happens to accidentally injure Anna while they both were playing in the childhood
user2: She injured her with her magical powers
user1: What powers?
user2: cryokinetic magic
user1: Does Anna have powers as well?
user2: Then their parents took both of them to a colony led by Grand Pabbie where he heals Anna
user2: Nope
user2: But while healing, he removes her memories about Elsa's powers
user1: Is there a reason why?
user2: So that Anna doesn't know that her sister had harmed her probably
user1: Oh
user2: king and queen isolate both of them for their safety within the castle
user2: while both become teens, their parents die during a storm
user1: That's sad.
user2: Now when Elsa turns 21, she was going to be crowned as queen
user2: but she had a fear in her mind
user1: About her sister?
user2: that people might find out about her powers
user1: Ohh.
user1: I figured she would just tell people about them later, when she's older or trained.
user2: The castle opens up for coronation ceremony wherein Duke and a prince from Southern Isles comes to attend the ceremony
user1: Are they nice?
user2: Prince Hans and Anna fall in love and Hans proposes to Anna
user2: Yea
user1: Oooh.
user2: But Elsa objects to this and shows her powers
user1: She gets intro trouble, right?
user2: Looking at her powers, Duke brands her as monster
user2: Nope
user2: She flees but she has engulfed the kingdom in an eternal winter
user1: Are they trapped inside?
user2: Whereas she herself discards her crown and reaches North Mountain to create a palace of ice to live for her
user2: No
user1: Like the Fortress of Solitude.
user2: Anna reaches out to Elsa and then lets her know what she has done to the kingdom
user2: Instead of repenting, she  freezes Anna's heart
user1: Wow.
user2: Now the Kristooff from Elsa's kingdom takes her to  meet Grand Pabbie
user1: To look for a cure?
user2: who says to cure Anna a ture act of love could help 
user2: *true
user2: yea
user2: So he races her back to hans
user2: Anna is with Hans
user2: but rather than kissing her, he defeats Elsa's snow creature Marshmallow
user1: What's Marshmallow?
user2: and reveals that he had been plotting to sieze Elsa's kingdom
user2: A giant snow creature
user2: So Hans locks Anna in a room to die and lets everyone know that Elsa killed Anna
user2: And orders for Elsa's execution
user1: Woah.
user2: But somehow Elsa manages to escape the cell
user2: Doesn't it sounds adventurous
user2: ?
user1: Yeah, it does.
user2: While critics have said that bit more could have been done to have a better conclusion 
user2: but nevertheless its a complete entertainment as it has comedy, adventure
user1: Sounds like.
user2: SO would u be reading the fairy tale or directly watching the movie?
user1: I could do both. 
user2: ohh nice
user2: okay then I feel we are good
user2: Do u want to know anything else?
user1: Nope. Thanks, though.
user2: ur welcome
user2: Okay Then we end the conversation
user2: Bye
user1: See ya.

conversation:
user1: Have you watched Frozen?
user2: Helllo!
user1: Hi
user2: I have.seen it several times.  
user2: I really enjoyed it.  Have you seen it?
user1: I don't usually watch disney
user2: What kind of movies do you normally watch?
user1: But I might attempt to watch this one.
user1: More of thrillers. 
user1: This is a musical fantasy. Sounds kiddish.
user2: If you don't like Disney, you may not like Frozen.  It's very typical of a Disney movie.
user2: It is kiddish!
user1: Well it should be
user2: I'm a substitute teacher and one day the teacher left me Frozen to show 6 classes, so I watched it 6 times in one day.  That was a bit much!  LOL
user1: It is obviously intended for kids.
user2: Kids love it.
user1: Lol
user2: Do you have a favorite movie?
user1: It is a bit old now.
user2: What is it?
user1: Would have loved to talk about my favorite movie but I think we are supposed to talk about this movie lol
user2: Oh, Sorry!
user2: This is my second time to do a hit like this, so I'm just learning how to do it
user1: I understand. 2013 is a bit dated but it was popular.
user2: The music in Frozen is great, if you like music, it may be worth putting up with the Disney "smaltz" for.
user1: It also has great reviews. 
user1: 74/100 that's good
user2: It did have great reviews.  I think it had some of the best reviews of any movie that year.
user1: Why is a princess attached to a rugged man? hmmmm!
user2: I know, right?
user1: What was he dressed like? I wonder?
user2: All of the characters in Frozen were pretty interesting.

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: Hey
user1: Frozen is the movie
user2: Okay cool. Thank you. Have you ever seen it?
user1: I've seen it twice. I wasn't going to until I saw the raving reviews from everyone, though.
user1: It got an 89 on Rotten Tomatoes and has an A+ on Cinema Score.
user2: Oh yeah, I know what you mean. I didn't care to see it and only saw it once it started to air on TV. 
user2: I think it's okay but not anything spectacular. How'd you like it/
user2: ?
user1: I thought it was good. I didn't expect to like a kids movie, but it was the best family film I'd seen in years.
user2: Yeah definitely better than any of the other kids movies coming out around that time. Do you have kids? I have a couple but only one boy who was a baby when it came out, so I missed out on the hype.
user1: No, I don't. Has your boy seen it since then? I think he'd love the snowman
user2: Yes he watched it on the Disney channel and he does like the snowman and the other characters too. But not that much!

conversation:
user2: Hi
user1: hello
user2: What movie are we discussing?
user1: frozen
user2: Oh that's a good one.
user2: I like animation. Do you think this one is a good movie?
user1: I think Frozen should be seen by everyone of all ages.  It is a classic Disney movie.  Those old enough to remember Hans Christian Anderson stories they heard as kids should know it is based on The Snow Queen.  Even old folks can relate. 
user2: Oh I agree. It's definitely one of those must see films, as are all disney movies. 
user1: Yes, even those who don't like animated movies will be won over.  The 3D is so vivid and adds an element to an  old fashioned tale. 
user1: It received an A plus and about 90% of viewers on Rotten Tomatoes liked it and that's saying something.  That's about as good as you get review-wise. 
user1: It's also nice that there is a strong female character....something we really need these days. 
user2: Yes it's definitely a popular one even though it's been out several years now. It's still getting lots of attention by young viewers. Even the song is still a popular one that you can't really get out of your head.
user1: I can honestly say that even if you think you hate animated movies, you will be won over if you give it a chance. There is a good script, it is nice for adults too. 
user2: I agree, I don't think anyone could watch it and not like it.
user1: I thought we go to the next part after completing 3 turns each, so I am puzzled.  But anyway, Frozen is a classic movie based on a classic story done by a classic studio...Disney.  
user2: Yeah I'm not sure how long we are suppose to talk about the movie. Hands down a great movie and I'm sure we will continue to see Elsa's on Halloween for a while lol.
user1: Thought there would be 4 documents coming up, each one we had 3 turns of conversation.  So we have been going longer than that!  But I digress...lol
user1: BTW, if you like broadway, it has Idina Menzel.  Thought I would throw that in.  
user1: The "finish conversation" button is not operational, so I am perplexed how we go to the next document!
user2: Hopefully we can "let it go" soon lol. Not much of a broadway person but the movie is definitely 5 stars worthy.
user2: Yeah I thought it would just appear after a certain number of turns.
user1: There are boxes that say, tasks, strategies, send message...wonder if we should send a message and see what happens. 
user1: I do believe something has gone wrong.   Very frustrating.  
user2: Yeah I'm not sure what else we can do other than send messages back and forth and see if it appears soon.
user2: Your end must look the same as mine. Wasn't sure if one of us had a button we could press to finish the task but I don't have anything.
user2: other than abort conversation which will mess this up
user1: It said earlier that a new document would be loaded automatically after we finish 3 turns discussing the current one, but obviously that has not happened.  The only thing I can see is to abort the conversation.  This is a bit much. 
user1: They said only use the abort button if you are waiting more than 5 minutes for a partner to respond or if the partner is abusive.  Guess we sit here FROZEN for hours. 
user2: Yeah it's been 21 minutes already out of a 20 min survey so I guess abort.
user1: Do you have an abort button too?
user2: yes
user2: I'll just try to turn the hit in with my worker ID and send a message
user1: I think he said if you use your ID you will be rejected.  

conversation:
user1: Hello
user1: Frozen is a great movie that received very positive reviews
user1: Do you like animated movies?
user1: anyone there?
user2: hai
user2: anyone there

conversation:
user2: hi
user1: Good morning, Does this sound like a good movie to you?
user2: yes, it sounds pretty good,  what are your thoughts?
user1: It seems to be heart warming and emotional. I tend to avoid these types of movies like the plague.
user2: oh ok, I get what you're saying
user1: BUT, it's a Disney animated musical. Those are usually good - even with the princesses and the "happily ever afters."
user2: yes they are usually very good as far as animated movie go
user1: Do you think you want to watch it?
user2: kids will surely love this
user2: yes i will watch it with my daughter
user2: will you?
user1: I have a very jaded son. I don't think he wants to see this. BUT, it's in 3-D. That makes it a maybe. The ice man might be a source of action and adventure. Princesses usually aren't.
user1: Out of control ice magic is good. Being Disney, no one will die tho'. So, it's still a maybe for me and my boy.
user2: Yeah, he might also like the pet reindeer too
user1: Oh wait, the parents die - but I'm sure that's off screen.  
user2: oh yeah, theres always at least one parent dead in a disney film
user2: so nothing new there
user1: I think this would be a good discussion starter with my son tho. Talking about learning to control your emotions (i.e. ice powers) as opposed to suppressing them. We home school. So, everything we do is a lesson.
user2: yeah that would be good.  we homeschooled last year :)
user1: The home schooling world grows bigger every year!
user1: This movie seems to have a dark side I didn't know about. I mean, other than the dead parent. Disney hates parents - especially mothers! :-)
user2: I know, it does seem that way.  
user2: I had never heard of the fairy tale that this is based off of "The Snow Queen"
user1: I've heard of it, I think. Wasn't it a ballet?
user2: hmm, I don't know..
user1: OMG! This is really, really dark. I thought Hans was a good guy! I may actually want to see this movie now. In which case, my poor boy won't have a choice.
user2: It sounds like it has enough "boy stuff" in there to keep him interested.  Not a typical princess movie
user1: They list the actor's names as if I should know them. The only one that seems familiar is Kristen Bell. Was she in the vampire romance movies? Twilight?
user2: no that was Kristen Stewart
user2: I think Kristen Bell is on a comedy sitcom, just not sure which one
user1: Then I suck! The names mean nothing to me! 
user1: I wonder if I could say that this movie is an allegory of a child growing into adulthood. They have to learn to accept and control their power, everyone who looks like their friend isn't their friend, and since it's Disney, everything ends well. I hope it ends well but they're being different so maybe not?

conversation:
user1: Hi
user2: Hello
user1: Anybody there?
user2: Have you seen Frozen?
user1: Yes, I have. Have you?
user2: I haven't, it looks to be a pretty good movie though
user1: Yes it does. We are only supposed to talk about stuff in your document though, so what did it tell you?
user2: even called Disney's best animated musical since the death of Howard Ashman
user1: I never heard of Howard Ashman.
user1: Do you like animated movies?
user2: He was a lyricist who worked on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast
user1: Ah, so what do you know about Frozen so far?
user2: Someone said its a great big snowy pleasure
user1: Yeah, but again, did you read a document on here about it?
user2: yes
user1: What did it tell you?
user2: Peincess Elsa of Arendelle possesses cryokinetic magic, often using it to play wiht her younger sist,e rAnna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, rush both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie.
user2: etc etc
user2: Doesn't really sound all that interesting to me, honestly
user1: Yes, did it mention that it is a musical?
user1: Or did it mention who the actors are behind the voices?
user1: Hello?
user2: It is a musical
user1: After all that time, this is what you tell me?
user1: Are you a bot or something?
user2: fuck off
user2: that'd be an interesting thing for a bot to be programmed to say
user1: Nice. Have you heard the songs from the movie? Like on YouTube... etc... pretty famous stuff
user1: yeah, that was not very nice of you
user2: I'm not exactly feeling your attitude either
user1: I was thinking instead of swearing at me you could be more forthcoming
user2: screw this
user2: FUCK YOU
user1: I jsut want my $2 for this...
user1: Hello, is there another use I am supposed to chat with? I don't remember how long this is supposed to go on.. or how I know when I am done....!!!!
user1: lah la lah....

conversation:
user2: I didn't know Frozen scored so high on rotten tomatoes.
user2: I was kind of surprised by that.
user1: I don't doubt it actually! So many kids and adults alike were huge fans of the songs! I liked the movie because it was a great musical 
user1: I liked the premise of the story and how Elsa's icy powers and conquering her fear were such a big part of the movie
user2: Yeah it did have pretty catchy songs. I didn't like the movie as I thought I would because I saw it later on after hearing about how amazing it was, I guess it didn't live up to the hype.
user1: Yeah, I can see how the critical responses being so positive and everyone rating it so highly would make it seem overhyped. 
user1: Are you generally a fan of Disney movies?
user2: Yeah, but I didn't think it was bad. It was a nice movie to see. 
user1: Is there any particular critical response you absolutely agree with?
user2: Yeah, I like disney movies, especially the ones I grew up watching. I would watch Toy Story about 3 times a day at one point.
user2: This one: "You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become whilewatching Disney's 3D animated princess tale."
user1: Omg! Toy story is an amazing and classic Disney movie! Do you think Frozen matches the "comedy, animation, and adventure?" genre?
user2: The entire time I was watching it, I thought it'd be a really great musical, especially for the holidays.
user1: It really is. I definitely think Elsa accidentally injuring Anna was a key scene. I think if I was in her place, I'd be insecure using my powers as well. 
user2: Definitely, it had all of those elements and worked really well.
user1: I wonder if the trolls scene was at all frightening for children
user2: I agree, it definitely was. I'd be pretty insecure too. The scene also created depth for the characters and made you care about them. It was hard not to sympathize with the guilt Elsa felt.
user1: But it also made you feel the sadness that Anna had because she was isolated from her sister forcefully, and had no explanation for it, 
user2: Yeah, which is a really sad situation for both of them. 
user1: Agreed. I think the love scenes between Anna and Hans were funny and seemed too good to be true. 
user2: Yeah, that's a good point. I wonder if children felt that as well.
user1: I can understand why Elsa would object and get mad enough to unleash a icy storm
user2: Yeah, me too. It was nice, it showed she still cared about her sister, but I don't think Anna saw it that way in the beginning.
user1: Yeah, but it might have caught her by surprise considering her sister and her had not talked for much of her life. 
user2: I would probably be surprised too honestly, especially after all those years of not knowing what was going on.
user1: I think it was incredibly well thought out. I think the Hans aspect was an amazing plot twist that many people would not have seen coming 
user1: I also think Olaf deserved a lot of credit in this movie for being a great comic relief 
user2: I had some suspicion about Hands throughout the movie, but it was sad to see how it played out.
user2: Ahaha, Olaf was the star of the show at a lot of times.
user1: Oh! Smart cookie you are! And I absolutely agree he was. Without him and Kristoff, there would not have been an amazing movie!
user1: Also I think we're allowed to finish conversation now
user1: It was a pleasure talking to you!
user1: Thanks for your wonderful insight :)
